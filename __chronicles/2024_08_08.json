Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nAll five people on board an Air Dynasty helicopter were killed when it crashed on a hillside located some 11 kilometres northwest of Kathmandu on Wednesday. The accident comes just two weeks after the Saurya Airlines crash in Kathmandu that killed 18 people.This is the fifth helicopter crash in Nepal in two years. At least 41 crashes involving helicopters have been recorded across the country since 1979, including 20 fatal ones.On Wednesday, the air traffic controller gave a go-ahead for a 9N-AJD chopper belonging to Air Dynasty to fly from Kathmandu to Syaprubesi, Rasuwa, on the country’s northern border, with four Chinese nationals on board.An on-duty air traffic controller said the chopper lost contact with the Kathmandu tower two minutes after takeoff at 1:54 pm. “The weather was perfect. There was sunshine and no haze at Kathmandu’s airport.”“We were informed about two trips.”Bal Krishna Pandit, safety manager of Air Dynasty, said the flight was scheduled to take four Chinese nationals to the north, from where they would cross the border to their country. “On the return flight, the chopper would bring from Syapru five Americans who had reached there after the Kailash-Mansarovar pilgrimage tour in Tibet.” “We don’t know the exact reason behind the crash, but an initial report shows a weather problem in the Shivapuri hills, even though it was clear in Kathmandu,” said Pandit. The chopper may have encountered an abrupt change in weather and entered a fast-moving fog. It then hit a small hill and crashed into the jungle.Post photojournalist Angad Dhakal, who reached the crash site after an hour, said the area was blanketed by a thick fog. According to him, the locals reported a “big bang” inside the bushes.“The scene was horrific. Police were searching for missing body parts scattered over 50 metres.”The chopper had been totally burnt, except for the tail.DIG Dan Bahadur Karki, spokesperson for Nepal Police, said the bodies of four men and a woman were pulled from the wreckage. The chopper was flown by Captain Arun Malla, who also died.The crash site is in Suryachaur of Nuwakot district.Air Dynasty Heli Service is one of the oldest helicopter rescue companies in Nepal. It was founded in 1993 by Ang Tshering Sherpa, the owner of Yeti Group, who also died in an Air Dynasty helicopter crash in Pathibhara, Taplejung, in 2019. Along with him were tourism and civil aviation minister Rabindra Adhikari and a few top officials of the civil aviation body. In the past two years, there have been eight crashes—six fatal. On May 29 2022, a Tara Air plane carrying 22 people crashed on its way to Jomsom from Pokhara, killing 22 on board. On January 15, 2023, a Yeti Airlines plane crashed in Pokhara, killing 72 aboard. On July 11 last year, a Manang Air chopper crashed near Lamjura in Solukhumbu district, killing everyone aboard, including five Mexican tourists and a Nepali pilot.On October 14, a helicopter of Manang Air flying towards Solukhumbhu came down in Lobuche. Captain Prakash Kumar Sedhai, who was injured in the crash, died while undergoing treatment in India. On July 24, a Saurya Airlines plane crashed at the Tribhuvan International Airport, killing 18 people. At least 124 people have died in air crashes in the past two years, which suggests that air safety in Nepal has truly gone for a toss.“It’s unfortunate, again. Unless we focus on strengthening the Safety Oversight system, these kinds of accidents will continue to happen,” said Rajan Pokhrel, former director general of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal. “The prerequisite to strengthening safety oversight is establishing a dedicated aviation regulator, which the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal is not.” Wednesday’s crash is the eighth under Pradip Adhikari, the director general of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, and the fifth fatal one of his tenure.On Sunday, Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba and a group of party lawmakers met Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli to discuss domestic air safety.“The meeting was focused on tabling the civil aviation bills, which aim to split the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal into two entities: a service provider and a regulator,” said Rajendra Bajgain, one of the lawmakers.“The way people are being killed due to regulatory failures amounts to a heinous crime,” he said. The lawmakers have been demanding that Adhikari be sacked, for allegedly stopping the passage of the bills and for the lack of efforts to make Nepali skies safe.“A man has eight crashes under his belt. And yet, the government is not serious about his performance. The series of crashes has caused a big dent in Nepali tourism’s global image,” said Bajgain.In 2014, Spanish consultancy INECO prepared the first draft of the proposed legislation with $4.2 million in funding from the Asian Development Bank. The process had received the approval from the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal board in 2010.Since then, several drafts have been prepared and discarded. The draft of the bills prepared by a consulting firm of former law secretary Raju Man Singh Malla and reviewed by the Tourism Ministry was registered in the National Assembly on February 23, 2020, after the go-ahead by the KP Sharma Oli-led Cabinet at that time.The two pieces of legislation—the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal Bill and the Air Service Authority of Nepal Bill—were unanimously passed by the National Assembly on August 2, 2021.Since then, the bills’ tabling in the lower house has been blocked.“Now, the bills are back in the Oli Cabinet. It is the incumbent prime minister’s moral duty to table the bills that the upper house has already approved. It is the fastest way to break up the civil aviation body—and to make the Nepali skies safer,” said Pokhrel. \nThe top leaders of the three major parties have unanimously agreed to endorse the bill to amend the Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act at the ongoing session of the federal parliament.On Wednesday, receiving the report of the three-member taskforce formed to build consensus on the contentious issues of the bill, they claimed the country is now headed towards concluding the transitional justice process—the last leg of the peace process that began with the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Accord on November 21, 2006.The chiefs of the three prominent parties had on July 1 formed the taskforce comprised of Ramesh Lekhak of the Nepali Congress, Mahesh Bartaula of the CPN-UML and Janardan Sharma of the CPN (Maoist Centre) after the Law, Justice and Human Rights Committee of the House of Representatives failed to iron out differences mainly over four provisions in the bill.It took a month and six sittings for the Lekhak-led panel to build consensus. The report was submitted jointly to Prime Minister and UML chair KP Sharma Oli, Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba and CPN (Maoist Centre) Chairperson Pushpa Kamal Dahal. “The agreement has been reached taking the Supreme Court’s verdict, international standards and a victim-centric approach into consideration. This is a milestone in concluding the remaining task of the peace process,” said Oli after receiving the report. “Now there is no confusion and dilemma over completing the pending tasks of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons.”The process of appointing office bearers to the commissions would follow the bill’s parliamentary endorsement. Oli said the amendment bill will be tabled in the federal parliament, ensuring that it gets through the ongoing session. Also receiving the report, Dahal said the agreement is a significant achievement of the present government. “I would like to request the government to present the bill in the full House and get it endorsed,” said Dahal. “When the political agreement transforms into law, it will lead to a long-term solution to conflict-related issues through relief and reparation, among other measures.” The top leadership has claimed Nepal will set an example for the world by concluding the transitional justice process. “I appreciate the efforts made by our friends in finding a consensus on the bill. Nepal will present an example to the world if it manages to conclude the transitional justice process,” said Deuba.As per the written agreement made public on Wednesday, the taskforce has agreed to list rape or serious cases of sexual violence, intentional or arbitary killing, enforced disappearances and inhumane or cruel torture as serious violations of human rights thus non-amnestiable. Rest of the incidents fall as human rights violations and are amnestiable.The three parties have also agreed to include a provision which says that in cases other than serious violations of human rights, there can be reconciliation (between the victim and the perpetrator). According to another point of agreement, the attorney general cannot be forced to press ahead with a legal case in cases of human rights violations or serious violations of human rights where there has been reconciliation or a recommendation for amnesty. The taskforce also agreed to reduce sentencing by up to 75 percent except in cases of rape or serious sexual violence. It has set different yardsticks to do so. Decisions on reduced penalty can be taken after examining whether the perpetrators provide information on the allegations against them, whether they cooperate with the commissions on evidence collection and whether they express remorse for their acts. Similarly, before recommending a reduction in penalty, the commissions need to evaluate whether the perpetrators have apologised to the victims and made commitments not to repeat such acts. All disqualified Maoist combatants including child soldiers, along with the families of security personnel who died or got injured during the insurgency, will get reparation and compensation, as per the agreement. However, the issue of child soldiers, which is considered a war crime, along with crimes against humanity and other acts of war crime find no mention in the agreement. Based on the three-party agreement, the committee will endorse the bill and forward it to the House of Representatives. The bill must be endorsed by both chambers of the federal parliament to come into effect. There will be no obstacle for the bill’s endorsement as the three parties hold more than two thirds of seats in Parliament. \nThe Nepali Congress Central Working Committee examined and amended party reports, including proposals to contest future elections independently and address issues related to the Maoist insurgency and the safety of Nepali citizens abroad.\nNepal's women's volleyball team lost 3-2 to India in the final of the CAVA Nations League, falling short of their first international trophy; despite a strong start and a group stage victory over India, Nepal was unable to overcome India's comeback in the fifth set.\nFive Nepali remains from Russia-Ukraine war handed over to families, with details of deceased and ongoing status of other Nepali nationals involved in the conflict.\nNepal and Oman establish comprehensive cooperation framework, including high-level visits, trade, investment, and people-to-people engagement.\nNepali Embassy in Abu Dhabi warns Nepali residents in UAE to avoid alcohol-fueled misconduct, as reported incidents have prompted police action.\nThe Supreme Court has ordered the government not to implement the decision to remove Kapil Acharya and Bhakta Bahadur Pun from the post of the board of directors of Nepal Electricity Authority until the next order.Hearing on the writ petition filed by Acharya and Pun, a single bench of Justice Sunil Kumar Pokharel on Thursday ordered the authorities not to implement the ministerial-level decision to remove the petitioners from their positions.They had mentioned the Office of the Prime Ministers and Council of Ministers; Minister for Energy, Water Resources and Irrigation Dipak Khadka; Nepal Electricity Authority; and newly appointed directors Devendra Karki and Mahendra Bahadur Gurung as defendants in the case.Minister Khadka appointed Karki and Gurung in the two posts that went vacant after the removal of Pun and Acharya on August 2. Karki and Gurung were also appointed on the same day.Earlier, Acharya and Pun were asked for written clarification on July 30 as they took a firm stance that the industries that didn’t pay the outstanding dues for using the electricity facility through dedicated and trunk lines should be cut and not be connected until they paid the dues.Minister Khadka relieved both of them the day they submitted their clarification citing that their answers were inadequate and not satisfactory.They firmly stood against resuming electricity supply to the industries in spite of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s assurance to the industrialists that the public utility would resume the power supply to the industries despite the dues they owe to it.The energy authority had cut off the power supply to Reliance Spinning Mills, Ghorahi Cement, Arghakhanchi Cement, Jagdamba Steel, Jagdamba Synthetics and Hulas Steel since July 9 for not clearing the due.After constant pressure from Prime Minister Oli and the decision of the NEA Board, the power was resumed to the industries from July 24. \nThe taskforce of the three major political parties—the Nepali Congress, the CPN-UML and the Maoist Centre—formed to find meeting points on the contentious provisions of the bill to amend the transitional justice-related law has submitted its report to the chiefs of three parties. The points of the agreement forged by the three-member panel were informally made public last week. Again, most notably, on Wednesday the chiefs of all three parties jointly accepted the report and unequivocally committed to resolving the remaining task of the peace process. After getting the report, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli vowed to expedite the bill and endorse it from Parliament without any further ado and then to swiftly implement it. In the prime minister’s words, this time, the amendment to the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act would be meaningful and the ‘remnants of the conflict’ will be dealt with once and for all. Chairman of the CPN (Maoist Centre) Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who led the decade-long Maoist insurgency, and Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, sounded as committed to finding closure. Much optimism based just on Nepali leaders’ words may not be warranted. But, at times, important political achievements have been possible when leaders of these three parties have joined hands. Signing of the Comprehensive Peace Accord in 2006, management of arms and army of the Maoist party, constitution promulgation in 2015, among other knotty issues related to the peace process, took place based on such understanding among these forces. A major but crucial task that remains pending is delivery of justice to the victims, as envisioned in the CPA all those years ago. Of the three parties, Dahal of the Maoist Centre and Nepali Congress’ Deuba often felt put under pressure to swiftly conclude the peace process, as these parties were directly engaged in the insurgency from opposite sides—much more than the UML. In the past when Deuba and Dahal tried to push the process, UML leaders appeared intent on hindering its progress, sometimes out of conviction and sometimes for purely political reasons. With Prime Minister Oli keen to conclude the process at a time of his government leadership, and Deuba and Dahal ready to capitalise on the rare opportunity, there could perhaps be no better time to take the peace process to its conclusion. That said, the agreement among the leaders of the three parties is not sufficient. They must not forget that all they are doing is ultimately aimed at the victims. If the victims feel they are not getting justice, completing the process would be meaningless. Many have found the provisions proposed by the three-member panel largely progressive and fair, but a section of victims are still dissatisfied with a few conditions. We urge the major politicians to strive to address the concerns of these holdout victims while giving final touches to the amendment bill. Trying to ram the bill through Parliament without such effort would be ill-advised. Addressing the concerns raised by the Supreme Court in its past decisions and winning the trust of the international community is as important. On the other hand, those advocating on the victims’ behalf would also do well not to seek a perfect solution to what is an inherently complex problem.  \nNepali politics has been polarised in a new fashion, particularly after the July 1 deal between the two largest parties to form a governing coalition.While the CPN-UML and the Nepali Congress, with most seats in the House of Representatives, teamed up to edge the Maoists out of the government, the pretext given was to tide the country over its “unprecedented crisis of public confidence in the government” and a “historic low of hope in the general people”.The opposition bloc led by preceding prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal of the Maoist Centre, with the Rabi Lamichhane-led Rastriya Swatantra Party and Madhav Nepal’s Unified Socialist by his side, counters the narrative that the two parties joined forces to pull the country from the brink. Voices on the opposition benches are that old foxes of Nepali politics were ruffled by the Dahal government’s sparing none in corruption cases policy, even those working closely with top politicians.What’s questionable are intentions, not issues. No informed citizen denies today that the country faces humongous challenges. For good or bad, nearly 4,000 Nepalis leave the country daily; those who return are far fewer. The country’s farm and industrial outputs are way short of its domestic requirements. There’s a gloom in the jobs sector and wages are stagnant, even falling.The constitutional dynamiteNepal’s new constitution will mark a decade next year. Feared to fail from its inception, it still cries for full ownership at home and the goodwill of the country’s all-dominant southern neighbour. The Congress and the UML are blaming it, rather than their own waning popularity, for the country’s federal and provincial legislatures, where no single party currently has a majority and government changes have been too frequent.Tampering with the constitution may be akin to opening Pandora’s box. After years-long negotiations, the three major parties had hastily sealed it in 2015.There are several misgivings about the new political order. The Hindu hardliners aren’t happy with the secular state. The ethnic groups or janajatis aren’t satisfied with how most of the provinces were carved out or named. Women need more equality in terms of representation. The provinces want more autonomy. However, the clamour for charter revision is only about the Congress and the UML maintaining their old hegemony. The rise of new forces threatens them, and they want to tame the tendencies of adventurist politicians like Maoist supremo Dahal or stub out the quest for power in Madhav Nepal by denying them opportunities to regroup or forge electoral alliances.A blamed factor in the current state of hung parliament is the low threshold for parties to claim their proportional representation seats. A slight rise from the current 3 percent of total valid votes would reduce the number of national parties by at least two, giving their proportional seats to the bigger forces. While the most prominent parties’ frustration at being undercut by smaller forces at the elections is visible, getting the constitutional amendments through is not easy.A clash of titansSharing of power between the two competing parties is fraught with problems. As the developments so far suggest, there are dissatisfied aspirants aplenty, particularly in Congress, despite the swift formation of the Cabinet under Oli. What looks more complicated is installing new provincial governments as the existing ones have toppled after the change of the ruling coalition in Kathmandu. In the provinces, which are in the eye of an anti-federal storm that’s brewing in the marginalised communities and among Hindu hardliners, chief ministers are already facing problems with shaping their Cabinet. Ministerial positions are reportedly falling short in Gandaki as the number of hopefuls is too high. Splitting ministries to appoint more ministers gives rise to mass frustration that politicians are trying to steal public finances.This KP Sharma Oli government is based on a seven-point agreement between the two parties. Under the deal, the UML leader will remain prime minister for the first two years. Oli will then hand over the reins to Sher Bahadur Deuba of the Congress, who will steer the government until a new parliament is elected. That’s subject to things staying their course, though. In the unpredictable politics of today’s Nepal, what’s not agreed to often happens.Politicians well acquainted with Oli do not see smooth sailing for both the UML and the Congress. One such doubter is RK Mainali, one of Oli’s jail mates from the repressive Panchayat regime. The Congress and the UML are historical arch-rivals, who have used every opportunity to check on each other in power and elections. In the most recent exercise, each has used the Maoist Centre as a coalition partner or an electoral ally to defeat the rival party. Mainali argues that if the Supreme Court rules in favour of Oli in the case of constitutionality of the government formation process, he will, in due course, make the UML the largest party by taking in smaller leftist forces. If the court ousts Oli, ruling that the government should have been formed under Article 76(3) of the constitution, rather than Article 76(2) through which Oli came in, Deuba will be appointed the prime minister as the leader of the single largest party. This could set in motion the downfall of Nepal’s fragmented communist front.Bay of Bengal climateThere’s a big churn in the political climate surrounding the Bay of Bengal nations. First with the Sri Lankan uprising in 2022, then the regime changes in the Maldives late last year and Imran Khan’s political purge in Pakistan early this year, a popular storm in Bangladesh rooted Sheikh Hasina out of power on Monday and threw her into exile. Early cautions from the events unfolding in the country 27 kilometres away from Nepal suggest that rulers in the neighbourhood should brace for potential repercussions at home. It’d be undesirable for the government in Kathmandu to inflame the public in any way at a time of desperation, starting right from the 2020 pandemic and the cost of living crisis worsened by Russia’s ongoing Ukraine war and the escalating conflict in West Asia.One such trigger in Nepal could be haphazard tampering of the constitution while the dust over its chaotic promulgation nine years ago has barely settled. We should not forget that the protests in the east over the province’s name ‘Koshi' have only been lulled by the summer heat and monsoon rains. Also, as the Bangladeshi situation has shown, not allowing big or small forces in peaceful politics can have deadly consequences. In Nepal, too, the Congress and the UML have floated a self-appeasing idea that smaller forces should be swallowed up by ideological polarisation, aided with the tool of a proposed 5-10 percent vote threshold mandatory to become a national party. This will surely draw up a strong bloc of parties opposed to such a scheme for spearheading a movement in a volatile situation. \nThe thunderous sounds in the streets were no longer of sound grenades and bullets. They were the reverberating cheers of thousands of people celebrating the culmination of an arduous, painful and, sadly, bloody journey to victory. It is, no doubt, a victory of the students and the people of Bangladesh. And it is the total defeat of a leader and government that has shown their most monstrous side by turning state machinery, along with their party goons, on their own people.This victory has come at the cost of hundreds of lives of overwhelmingly young people, mostly students. Even small children have not been spared—basically the future of this nation. Was it possible for a government to continue to stay in power after killing the country's future, for murdering ordinary citizens in cold blood? Was it possible for a leader to keep on denying the truth about these murders by her own direction, blaming them on her political opponents when the evidence is out in the open for all to see? Could any leader and cabinet be more detached from the pulse of the people, from the hearts of the youth?The outcome of the events of the last few weeks were inevitable. Even after killing more than 200 people in less than a week and with no let up from the protesters, Sheikh Hasina's obstinance prevailed. On August 4, the violence escalated to newer levels, leaving at least 93 dead. The former prime minister had become deaf to the cries of the people, blind to the sea of blood she had spilled with the help of the police, BGB, and the unnamed goons who fired guns right beside these forces. Thus, on August 5, despite an indefinite curfew being called, in spite of the memory of those chilling sounds of impending death, the people could not be held back. In Dhaka, the eerie calmness of the morning changed very quickly with crowds forming practically on every main thoroughfare, with the biggest one in Shahbag, where everyone seemed to congregate. As hard as it is to believe, only a little while ago, protesters had been shot near the Shaheed Minar and other areas.When the army started to clear the way for the crowd, the mood changed even more dramatically. Even before the news of the unseemly exit of the former prime minister from Gono Bhaban by helicopter started spreading, the sounds of freedom from a repressive regime that had shown just how merciless it could get to retain power, resonated throughout the streets. The incredibly brave young people of this country have steadfastly stood up once again against the full force of an autocratic government—and won!But volatility is a constant in our reality; all too soon, things did take an ugly turn. The pent-up anger of people was displayed in the most distasteful way with the ransacking of Gono Bhaban, seen as the seat of a hated regime, setting of fire to the Bangabandhu Bhaban at Dhanmondi 32 and to police stations all over the country, and attacks on houses and businesses belonging to the Hindu community and on their temples. The feeling of jubilation was tainted by the violence which went on without any hindrance. After watching children, students and ordinary citizens being ruthlessly murdered by the orders of the government, the fury of the public is understandable. But violence cannot bring justice for violence.This is the message that the members of the Bangladesh Student Uprising Central Committee have voiced during their press briefing on Channel 24. They have categorically told their fellow protesters to be vigilant of those taking advantage of the situation, who have carried out arson attacks and vandalism in order to malign the movement. They asked everyone to be mindful of instigators and refrain from any kind of looting, arson, communal violence and protect all minority communities and public assets. They have insisted that their movement is peaceful and has brought about a national unity that transcends political party or religion. They promised to stand against any kind of communal violence.The clarity and determination of these young leaders is awe-inspiring. More so because we have not heard our leaders talk like this for decades. Yes, we have claimed to be a democracy for the last 33 years. Yet, when was the last time we heard words like \"justice\" and \"equality\" from the mouth of a leader? When was the last time we heard that all cases of enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings would be tried and those involved would be brought to book?As of this writing, a group of representatives of the movement were set to visit Bangabhaban to meet up with the president. They have made it very clear that any government that comes without the endorsement of the members of the movement would not be acceptable and would result in the continuation of the movement.There are, of course, misgivings that the former regime will somehow manipulate the situation, that other players including extremist forces will take over. We don't know what lies ahead for us, and the uncertainty makes us jittery and holds us back from unreservedly celebrating this victory.But listening to the resolute voices of these young people who have a clear idea of what kind of country they want to build, one that enshrines the true values of democracy, one cannot help but feel hopeful that a real change, one that will truly free us from the suffocating clutch of fear, could actually be possible. When I see young protesters managing traffic and pictures of Muslims guarding Hindu temples on social media, the feeling gets stronger. Abu Sayed and his fellow martyrs would be proud.-The Daily Star (Bangladesh)/ANN \nCPN-UML Chair and current Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli is instinctively combative against anyone he sees as even remotely challenging his authority. Using his unmatched flair for Nepali idioms, he is a past master at verbally taking down the credibility of his political opponents. The good news for him is that after the exit from the UML of senior leaders like Madhav Kumar Nepal and Jhalanath Khanal in early 2021, Oli has near complete control over the party machinery. Yet the insecurity over the possible emergence of rival leaders apparently continues to gnaw at the septuagenarian leader. The much-discussed reentry of ex-Nepali President Bidya Devi Bhandari into the UML fold may have given Oli many sleepless nights. Bhandari is not his only headache. Speaking at a party meeting on Sunday, Oli warned the UML rank and file that no kind of factionalism would be tolerated in the party. He added, for good measure, that even though such diktats had been issued in the past, this time he was dead serious. But then the chairperson is himself being accused of promoting factionalism. For instance, Bishnu Paudel, a trusted lieutenant of Oli, was made the finance minister on top of his responsibility of monitoring the party’s organisational activities. But Prithivi Subba Gurung, the new minister of information and communication, who has often had testy ties with Oli, is now without any responsibility in the party. (Earlier, he used to lead the UML’s parliamentary affairs department.) The ‘burden’ of dual responsibilities is apparently fine for a leader close to the party chair, someone more distant cannot be similarly overburdened. While Oli spoke on Sunday, he was also hinting at the undesirability of other possible factions in his party. There seems to be great tussle between Pokharel and Paudel, two Oli stalwarts, for influence. Most recently, this was seen during the appointment of the chief minister of Lumbini Province, with Chet Nath Acharya (who is close to Pokharel) and Leela Giri (close to Paudel) duelling it out for the top job, with Acharya eventually coming out on top. This tussle seems to have displeased Oli, perhaps because it suggests even his close acolytes might not be under his total control.A degree of competition is not just desirable but healthy for political parties. Yet Oli is having none of it. He warned his party that the promotion of factional politics in the name of internal democracy is unacceptable. Factionalism and internal democracy are both anathema to Oli. Even while he may boast that he will run the party for another two decades, it is only natural for those in and outside the UML to think of his eventual successor as party chair. Only with the right kind of debate will the right candidate emerge. Trying to maintain complete control is one sure way to break the party, as Oli found out in 2021. It might have worked to his advantage back then, yet if something like that happens again, Oli’s political stature is sure to be diminished. Oli as the party’s custodian should be promoting healthy debates and discussions instead of trying to stifle dissent. As the undisputed leader of the UML, he has everything to gain by adopting this more democratic approach to governance.    \nAn Austrian teenager arrested over an alleged plot to strike a Taylor Swift concert in Vienna had built explosive devices for his attack and had pledged loyalty to Islamic State, authorities said on Thursday.The 19-year-old man, who has North Macedonian roots, made a full confession in custody, Austria’s general director for public security Franz Ruf told a news conference.He swore allegiance to the IS group, opens new tab’s leader on the internet and had chemicals, machetes, and technical devices at his home in the town of Ternitz in preparation for an attack, Ruf added.The suspect, whose name was not given, was planning a lethal assault among the estimated 20,000 “Swiftie” fans set to gather outside Ernst Happel Stadium, said national intelligence head Omar Haijawi-Pirchner.“He wanted to carry out an attack in the area outside the stadium, killing as many people as possible using the knives or even using the explosive devices he had made,” he said, adding there were no explicit threats to other concerts.Two other Austrian youths aged 17 and 15 were also detained on Wednesday over the foiled plot. Authorities painted a picture of the main suspect as having self-radicalised, transforming his appearance and sharing Islamist propaganda online. He quit his job on July 25, telling people he had \"big plans\", Ruf said.One neighbour told Austrian broadcaster Puls24 that he kept himself to himself and had grown a “Taliban beard”.Swift’s three concerts in Vienna, due to start on Thursday for a soldout 65,000 audience each, were cancelled, to the consternation of fans, many of whom had travelled far.“It’s just heartbreaking, just frustrating. But at the end of the day I guess it’s for everyone's safety,” said Mark del Rosario, who had flown from the Philippines to see the wildly popular U.S. singer.MUSIC WORLD ROCKEDU.S. broadcaster ABC cited law enforcement and intelligence sources as saying Austrian authorities had received information about the Swift concert threat from U.S. intelligence.It cited the sources as saying at least one of the suspects had pledged allegiance to ISIS-K, a resurgent wing of IS, on Telegram in June, though the plot was IS-inspired rather than directed by the group's operatives.Austrian Interior Minister Gerhard Karner said foreign intelligence agencies had helped with the investigation, as Austrian law does not allow monitoring of messenger apps.Event organiser Live Nation urged fans of Coldplay, which is due to play at the same stadium on Aug. 21, to stay calm and said it was in contact with authorities.It did not comment on whether the show would take place.British police said on Thursday there was nothing to indicate that the planned attack in Vienna would have an impact on Swift’s shows at Wembley Stadium in London next week.“Concerts are often a preferred target of Islamist attackers, large concerts,” said Karner, listing the 2015 attack on Paris' Bataclan venue and the 2017 bombing at the Manchester Arena where U.S. pop star Ariana Grande had played.The plot in Austria also brought to mind a foiled plan by three IS-linked suspects against Vienna's gay pride parade last year. IS was largely crushed by a U.S.-led coalition several years ago after establishing a “caliphate” in large areas of Iraq and Syria, but has still managed some major attacks while seeking to rebuild and reinvent itself.NATIONAL SECURITY REVAMPAustrian authorities have revamped their national security intelligence in the wake of a 2020 attack by a convicted jihadist in the centre of Vienna that left four dead, the first such militant attack in the Austrian capital in a generation.This week's shows were to be part of the record-breaking Eras Tour by the American singer-songwriter which started on March 17, 2023, in Glendale, Arizona, U.S., and is set to conclude on Dec. 8, 2024, in Vancouver, Canada.Swift, 34, has not yet commented on the cancellations on her official Instagram account which has 283 million followers.Her fans were horrified at the threat, with some begging organizers to postpone the concert instead of cancelling it outright. Promoters have said they will pay back tickets.“As disappointing as not being able to go to this concert is TRUST ME u do not want to experience that,” added another. \nNobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus returned home to strife-torn Bangladesh on Thursday, to lead a new interim government after weeks of tumultuous student protests forced Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to resign and flee to neighbouring India.The South Asian nation’s only Nobel laureate and a harsh critic of Hasina, Yunus, 84, arrived in Dhaka following medical treatment in Paris, after protesters backed him for the role in a government tasked with holding elections for a new leader.“I feel good coming back home,” the economist said at the airport, where he was greeted by top military officers and student leaders.The student protesters had saved the country and that freedom had to be protected, he said, adding, “Whatever path our students show us, we will move ahead with that.”Yunus is set to be sworn in as chief of a team of advisers at 14:30 GMT, at the official residence of President Mohammed Shahabuddin.Hasina’s Awami League party does not figure in the interim government after she resigned on Monday, following weeks of violence that killed about 300 people and injured thousands.In a Facebook post, her son Sajeeb Wazed Joy said the party had not given up, however, and was ready to hold talks with opponents and the interim government.“I had said my family will no longer be involved in politics but the way our party leaders and workers are being attacked, we cannot give up,” he said on Wednesday.Yunus, known as the ‘banker to the poor’, received the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for founding a bank that pioneered the fight on poverty through small loans to needy borrowers.Hasina’s dramatic exit from the country she ruled for 20 of the last 30 years, winning a fourth straight term in January, triggered jubilation and violence as crowds stormed and ransacked her official residence unopposed.She is sheltering at an air base near New Delhi, the Indian capital, a development that Yunus said sparked anger at India among some Bangladeshis.The student-led movement that ousted Hasina grew out of protests against quotas in government jobs that spiralled in July, provoking a violent crackdown that drew global criticism, though the government denied using excessive force.The protests were fuelled also by harsh economic conditions and political repression in the country, born after a war of liberation from Pakistan in 1971. \n An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.1 hit southwestern Japan on Thursday, triggering tsunami advisories, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) said, but there were no immediate signs of major damage.There have been no reports of abnormalities at nuclear power plants following the quake, and the government is checking for damage and casualties, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters.The quake occurred at around 4:43 pm off Miyazaki prefecture on the western major island of Kyushu, the JMA said.In Miyazaki, waves as high as 50 cm (20 inches) have already been observed, public broadcaster NHK said. \nMinister for Culture, Tourism, and Civil Aviation Badri Prasad Pandey on Thursday inspected the Air Dynasty chopper crash site in Shivapuri Rural Municipality-7 in Nuwakot.According to the minister’s secretariat, secretary Ganesh Prasad Pandey, officials from the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, representatives from security agencies, and Chief District Officer of Nuwakot Ram Krishna Adhikari were present during the inspection.Minister Pandey had planned to visit the crash site on Wednesday, but the visit was not possible due to an emergency Cabinet meeting, his secretariat said.On Wednesday night, Minister Pandey’s secretariat issued a press note stating that the minister has postponed previously scheduled formal programmes for a week to focus on immediate and long-term tasks related to air safety.All five people on board an Air Dynasty helicopter were killed when it crashed on a hillside located some 11 kilometres northwest of Kathmandu on Wednesday. The accident comes just two weeks after the Saurya Airlines crash in Kathmandu that killed 18 people. \nBangladesh is set to get a new, interim government headed by Nobel Peace Prize-winning economist Muhammad Yunus on Thursday, after weeks of tumultuous student protests forced Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to resign and flee to India.Yunus, 84, Bangladesh’s only Nobel laureate and a harsh critic of Hasina, was recommended for the job by the student protesters who led the campaign against Hasina.He was expected to be sworn in as chief adviser along with a team of advisers later on Thursday in an interim government which the army chief said may include 15 members, although discussions on the names continued till late on Wednesday.Hasina’s Awami League party was not involved in all-party discussions led by army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman, who announced Hasina’s resignation on Monday.Her son Sajeeb Wazed Joy said in a Facebook post late on Wednesday that the party had not given up yet and was ready to hold talks with opponents and the administration.“I had said my family will no longer be involved in politics but the way our party leaders and workers are being attacked, we cannot give up,” Joy said.Yunus is known as the ‘banker to the poor’ and was awarded the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for founding a bank that pioneered fighting poverty with small loans to needy borrowers.He is due to arrive in the capital Dhaka from Paris on Thursday, where he had been receiving medical treatment.“I’m looking forward to going back home and see what’s happening there and how we can organise ourselves to get out of the trouble that we’re in,” Yunus said before he boarded a flight on Wednesday evening.Hasina’s dramatic exit on Monday from the country she ruled for four terms - and was reelected to a fifth in January - triggered jubilation and violence across Bangladesh, as crowds stormed and ransacked her official residence unopposed.She fled to neighbouring India where she is taking shelter at an air base near the capital New Delhi.Student protests against quotas for government jobs spiralled in July, killing about 300 people and injuring thousands, as demonstrations were met with a violent crackdown that was criticised internationally although the government denied using excessive force.The protests were fuelled by tough economic conditions and political repression as well.After years of strong growth as the garment industry expanded, the $450 billion economy struggled with costly imports, inflation and unemployment and the government had sought a bailout from the International Monetary Fund.Yunus and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), Hasina’s main political opponent, called for calm and an end to violence on Wednesday.“No destruction, revenge or vengeance,” said Hasina’s arch rival and BNP leader Khaleda Zia, 78, in a video address from her hospital bed to hundreds of her supporters at a rally in Dhaka on Wednesday.Zia, who was released from house arrest on Tuesday, and her exiled son Tarique Rahman, addressed the rally and called for national elections to be held within three months.On Wednesday, a court overturned Yunus’ conviction in a labour case in which he was handed a six-month jail sentence in January. Yunus had called his prosecution political, part of a campaign by Hasina to quash dissent.“Let us make the best use of our new victory,” Yunus said. \nThousands of police and anti-racism protesters gathered on streets across Britain on Wednesday to challenge expected far-right groups that failed to materialise following more than a week of violent racist attacks targeting Muslims and migrants.Britain has been hit by a series of riots that erupted early last week after three young girls were killed in a knife attack in Southport, northwest England, triggering a wave of false messaging online that wrongly identified the suspected killer as an Islamist migrant.Posts online had said far-right, anti-Muslim protesters would target a list of immigration centres, migrant support centres and specialist law firms on Wednesday, prompting many businesses to close early and some shops to board up windows.The reports prompted the deployment of thousands of police officers, and crowds of protesters massed in towns and cities including London, Bristol, Birmingham, Liverpool and Hastings, holding banners saying \"Fight racism\", \"Stop the far right\" and \"Will trade racists for refugees\".The protesters were made up of a diverse collection of Muslims, anti-racist and anti-fascist groups, trade unionists, left-wing organisations, and locals appalled at the riots that had hit the country.By 9 p.m. (2000 GMT) there were no reports of any serious disorder. Police said around 50 people in Croydon, south London, had thrown bottles and were trying to cause disruption.Waste collector Stetson Matthew, 64, who joined thousands of demonstrators in Walthamstow, northeast London, said people had the right to protest but that the targeting of ethnic minorities had put the country on edge.\"Everybody has the right to do what they need to do but what they must do is to put their voices across peacefully, amicably, without any stress or violence,\" he said.One woman who joined a counter protest in Hastings, southeast England, said she was relieved to see a large turnout.\"I felt I absolutely had to be here tonight to take a stand, and it is much easier for me to come as a white woman then for some of my non-white friends, so I’m here in solidarity,\" said 37-year-old Lucy, a flower grower, who declined to give her last name.‘Stop the boats’Riots erupted last week when groups of a few hundred mostly men clashed with police and smashed windows of hotels housing asylum-seekers from Africa, Asia and the Middle East, chanting “get them out” and “stop the boats” - a reference to those arriving in Britain in small dinghies without permission.They have also pelted mosques with rocks, prompting Muslim organisations to issue community safety advice.Prime Minister Keir Starmer, a former chief prosecutor who is facing his first crisis since winning a July 4 election, has warned rioters they would face lengthy jail terms as he seeks to stamp out the worst outbreak of violence in Britain in 13 years.A 58-year-old man was jailed for three years for violent disorder on Wednesday, while two others, aged 41 and 29, were sentenced to 20 and 30 months, respectively.“This is the swift action we’re taking. If you provoke violent disorder on our streets or online, you will face the full force of the law,” Starmer said.Migration to Britain was a major factor in its 2016 vote to leave the European Union and it was a battleground during last month’s election, with Nigel Farage’s Reform Party winning around 4 million votes on calls for tighter border controls.Britain saw record net migration levels in 2022, with numbers buoyed by those arriving from Ukraine and Hong Kong, and through work and student visas.Net migration through legal means was some 685,000 in 2023, while 29,000 people arrived on small boast across the Channel, many having fled war zones. The far-right chants of “stop the boats” was also a slogan of the Conservative Party before it was swept out of power after 14 years at the election.The government has put together a so-called “standing army” of 6,000 specialist police officers to respond to any violence.The National Police Chiefs’ Council said more than 120 people had been charged and 428 arrests made in connection with the disorder. \nThe weather across the country is expected to be partly to generally cloudy on Thursday. According to the Meteorological Forecasting Division, light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is likely in some areas of Koshi, Bagmati, Gandaki, Lumbini, Karnali, and Sudurpaschim provinces, with a few areas in Madhesh Province also experiencing similar conditions. There is a possibility of heavy rainfall in one or two locations within Bagmati, Gandaki, Lumbini, and Sudurpaschim provinces.Tonight, the skies will remain generally cloudy throughout the country. Light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is anticipated at some places in Koshi, Gandaki, Lumbini, and Sudurpaschim provinces, and at a few areas of the remaining provinces. Heavy rainfall may occur in one or two locations within Koshi, Gandaki, Lumbini, and Sudurpaschim provinces.Currently, the country is under the influence of monsoon winds, with the monsoon trough situated near its average position.On Wednesday, the highest maximum temperature recorded was 34°C in Simara, while the lowest minimum temperature was 15°C in Jomsom. Nepalgunj received the highest rainfall of 111 mm in the past 24 hours. \nKaran Vaidya is the honorary consul of the Republic of Latvia in Nepal and has served as the vice president of Vaidya Group since 2017. A bibliophile since childhood, he finds inspiration in reading and plans to write books in the future.In this conversation with the Post’s Sanskriti Pokharel, Vaidya discusses the role of reading in his personal and professional life and the genres he gravitates towards.How have your studies and experiences abroad influenced your duties as the Honorary Consul for the Republic of Latvia in Nepal?My education has taken me to various parts of the world, including the US, India, the UK, and China. This exposure has shaped my personality and character, moulding how I process information, think critically, and make decisions.My engineering degree at Purdue University, US, not only taught me engineering but also altered how I perceive systems and problems. It honed my ability to identify issues, deconstruct them, and devise effective solutions.How has reading influenced your professional, personal, and diplomatic professional growth?I have been an avid book reader since childhood. Reading is a habit that has influenced every aspect of my life. Books like ‘Power of Habit’ by Charles Duhigg and books on Stoicism by Ryan Holiday and Stoic philosophers have helped me create a disciplined routine.Professionally, I read depending on what skills I need to improve. Currently, I'm reading ‘Contagious’ by Jonah Berger. It's about the influence and effectiveness of word-of-mouth marketing in today’s digital era. Last month, I finished ‘Never Split the Difference’, a brilliant book by Chris Voss about negotiation skills. Staying informed about current affairs is crucial to diplomacy. That's why I always look for good geopolitics and international relations books.How do you pursue your interests in literature, culinary arts, and music alongside your busy work schedule?I love immersing myself in the arts and creativity, but my work often limits my time for creative pursuits. To stimulate my brain's logical and creative sides, I follow a routine. I set aside time daily to read a few pages from three books. Two of them, ‘The Daily Stoic’ and ‘The Daily Laws’, are short and straightforward, featuring a daily quote and its explanation. When I have more time in the evening, I try to read 20 to 50 pages of another book.Reading is a habit that enhances personal growth, so I always strive to gain wisdom from the words I read. Saturdays are my dedicated cooking days, which I enjoy. Unfortunately, I’ve had to put music on hold for a while. My guitar has been waiting for me to play it.What genres do you prefer, and in what ways do they align with your personal and professional goals?In fiction, I’m drawn to books featuring powerful yet realistic characters and those with a solid foundation of ethics and morality. These characters inspire me and help me remain steadfast in my ethical principles.I am focused on becoming a good executive in my profession. To support this goal, I delve into many nonfiction topics, such as management theory, emotional intelligence, and leadership.I also connect with Stoic philosophy. Its focus on emotional resilience, acceptance of impermanence, and understanding what we can and cannot control aligns well with my approach to handling life's challenges. During tough times, Stoicism guides me.What advice would you give young professionals and entrepreneurs about the value of reading?I encourage them to read consistently. It’s not just about gaining knowledge but also about sparking creative ideas. Start with a simple goal, like reading two pages daily, then gradually increase to four, eight, or ten pages. This small commitment can turn into a lasting habit. Over time, reading ten pages a day means you can finish a 300-page book in a month. This consistency will broaden your perspective and help you advance in your career.Karan Vaidya’s book recommendationsAtlas ShruggedAuthor: Ayn RandPublisher: Penguin Random HouseYear: 1957This novel presents Rand’s philosophy of objectivism in fictional form.

FranklPublisher: Beacon PressYear: 2006This one is about the author’s Holocaust experiences. A memorable quote from the book is, \"The man, whose self-esteem depended on others' respect, is emotionally destroyed.\" \nA fresh study has emphasised the need for Nepal to adopt a comprehensive approach to navigating the complexities of its upcoming graduation from a Least Developed Country in 2026. The study, Nepal LDC Graduation: Report on Trade Policy Reforms to Mitigate the Impact on WTO Obligations, was commissioned by the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies, with support from the European Union Nepal Trade and Investment Programme (TIP). It was presented at a public-private dialogue.The study highlights the need for Nepal to reform its legislative and regulatory frameworks, enhance institutional procedures, improve human resource capabilities, diversify export markets, and bolster international collaboration.Policymakers, trade experts, development partners, and private sector representatives agree that Nepal must expedite legal and policy reforms and strengthen institutional and human resource capacities to better prepare for post-graduation trade scenarios.Krishna Bahadur Raut, secretary at the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies, who presided over the programme, said the government seriously considers the concerns of, and suggestions from, the private sector regarding Nepal’s preparations. He also pledged efforts from the government side to ensure post-graduation benefits for Nepal.Debraj Joshi, joint-secretary at the ministry, said Nepal’s graduation presents both challenges and opportunities, adding that the country needs to continue reforms in trade-related policies and laws.Purushottam Ojha, a trade expert and former commerce secretary, emphasised the importance of adhering to new WTO obligations, including agreements on agriculture, subsidies, Agreements on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), and Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) for smooth transition.Abhijit Das, an International Trade Expert from the International Trade Centre, cautioned that the transition leads to stricter rules and reduced benefits, such as the loss of lower tariffs and stressed the urgency for implementing the action plan to ensure a smooth transition from the LDC status.Shobha Gyawali, president of the Federation of Nepal Women Entrepreneurs’ Association, said that Nepal is not yet mature enough for LDC graduation, and demanded benefits for women entrepreneurs from international trade.Other representatives of the private sector said the graduation seems to have been planned without due preparation, given the low competitiveness of Nepali businessmen and the higher cost of production and export compared to other countries.The study also cautions that Nepal will lose trade preferences under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) and Duty-Free Quota-Free schemes, potentially leading to higher tariffs on exports. It recommends detailed diagnostic study to identify vulnerable products and markets, exploring alternative trade arrangements like GSP-Plus in the European Union, and raising industry awareness through workshops.Strengthening national capacity to address non-tariff barriers, developing national standards, forming mutual recognition agreements with key trade partners, promoting products prioritised by the Nepal Trade Integration Strategy (NTIS) 2023, drawing lessons from other LDC-graduated countries, fostering partnership among governments, private sector, and international partners, are other recommendations of the study to ensure a successful transition by mitigating the impacts of LDC graduation. \nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nMost economists believe spending on infrastructure has a significant multiplier effect. During the construction phase, infrastructure generates real cash flow for workers and their families. In the long run, it has a direct and indirect impact on the economy, with a multiplier effect, particularly in job creation.In Rupandehi, which hosts the industrial city Bhairahawa, and Lumbini, a landmark of the Buddhist world listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1997, infrastructure built with a sizeable investment has gone to waste.Big infrastructure projects like the international convention centre, meditation centre, industrial zones, and Gautam Buddha International Airport have failed to generate income and have turned into veritable white elephants.Nature has started reclaiming most of the under-utilised infrastructure.Since 2010, talk of building an international airport led to the construction of large-scale infrastructure, including a bevy of luxury hotels.Proliferating factories and a rapidly spreading transport network turned the Butwal-Bhairahawa metroplex into an economic powerhouse.Nepal opened its second international airport in May 2022 in the southern city of Bhairahawa, but no international flight stops there right now.The objective of building an international airport in Bhairahawa was to bring in more tourists, energise businesses and create jobs. But the situation is just the opposite. Traders are closing down their shops and moving abroad for decent jobs.The private sector, too, invested heavily. When the finished project started to sit idle, it hit the sector, and many enterprises were teetering into bankruptcy.Economists term this development in Lumbini a cascading failure—a breakdown in a system of interconnected parts in which the failure of one or few parts leads to the failure of other parts. Hem Raj Regmi, deputy chief statistician and data curator at the National Statistics Office, said Lumbini province saw heavy investment from the government and the private sector, but the output has slowed. “Enterprises are unable to raise even the operating cost.”In the last fiscal year, Lumbini province was estimated to grow at 4.05 percent to a GDP of Rs814 billion, from the low base of the 1.99 percent growth it had achieved in the previous fiscal year. Lumbini is estimated to contribute 14.26 percent to the national GDP. The highest value-added growth rate in Lumbini was in electricity and gas, which grew by 28.93 percent, while the manufacturing sector was estimated to shrink by a negative 1.43 percent in the last fiscal year.Most completed infrastructures in Lumbini have become white elephants, as their expenditures have been growing instead of them generating income. The Butwal International Convention Center, built with an investment of Rs1.11 billion in ward 10 of Butwal Sub Metropolis, is currently without business. The centre has 13 halls, each with a capacity to accommodate 2,700 people. The auditorium is the largest of the 13.The government built the convention centre to organise national and international conferences and events, but it is not generating much income. Construction started in 2014 and the centre was inaugurated in August 2022.Officials say that the centre is struggling to pay its staff. While the centre is under-utilised and lacks maintenance, bushes have grown around it.Dharmendra Panthi, chief of the Butwal International Convention Center project, said 22 events or functions have been conducted in the past three years, earning Rs4 million. The centre is currently closed as the provincial cabinet is yet to pass the operating guidelines even in three years.However, Panthi said they have been occasionally renting the hall on request. The centre charges Rs96,000 for a day-long event.Prabin Pathak, president of the Nepal Hoteliers Association, who took part in a recent function at the convention centre, said the infrastructure is in a sorry state due to lack of periodic maintenance.“If the building is not utilised properly, it will be a waste of tax money,” said Pathak. “The washroom faucets are dry, and it is difficult to sit in the hall due to the stench from the washroom.”“In Nepal, there is a growing trend of building new infrastructure, but their upkeep is often ignored. This is sad,” Pathak said. “No one is accountable for the losses the projects incur. Similarly, questions are raised about the quality of construction. In most projects, low-quality materials are used, severely compromising the structural integrity.”A hall with a capacity to accommodate 5,000 people built near the Buddha’s birthplace, Lumbini, has yet to do any business, except hosting a few functions. It was built with an investment of Rs720 million.Sanuraja Shakya, member-secretary of the Lumbini Development Trust, said that if a social organisation wants to conduct a function at the centre, they have to pay a fee.Shakya said that since it is a meditation centre, they do not allow other functions, especially those involving entertainment.Questions were raised about the construction when the roof started leaking soon after project’s completion. It was repaired later.Likewise, the Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in Bhairahawa, has not been fully operational for a long time. As factories have not been set up in the SEZ, the area has turned into a jungle. Construction of the SEZ had started in 2003 and it was inaugurated in 2014.Located in south-central Nepal, the Bhairahawa Special Economic Zone has 69 industrial plots of sizes from 1,400 to 3,700 square metres. A few industrialists have booked plots, but have not set up their plants as the government has failed to provide pledged services and amenities. The government had promised to provide 24-hour electricity, a one-stop service system, customs, banks, and insurance among other things inside the SEZ.“Every year, new entrepreneurs book plots, but do not set up their factories due to associated tough conditions,” said Saput Dumre, assistant director of SEZ. Dumre said industrialists are concerned about the mandatory export provision. According to SEZ guidelines, which were amended three months ago, firms that lease space inside the SEZ must export at least 30 percent of manufactured goods. “There is a water tank in the SEZ, but it has no water, the weighing machine does not work, the petrol pump is defunct, there are no parking areas, and the road is covered in thick bushes,” said Ujjwal Prasad Kasaju, a central member of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry. Then there is the new Gautam Buddha International Airport—all dressed up, and nowhere to go. The airport awaits applications for flight slots from international airlines after more than two years of opening.Nepal's second international airport was ready after ten years and nearly Rs40 billion pumped into the project, but despite the build-up, the expected rush of eager carriers is nowhere to be seen.The airport is a landmark located in south central Nepal and spread over 787 bighas (533 hectares).The modern facility has a 15,169-square-metre terminal building that can serve nearly a million passengers a year. The airport's 3,000-metre runway is long enough to handle the largest commercial jets. However, no commercial jet wants to fly to the airport. \nIn Kathmandu, where construction dust often clouds the air, the resumption of the pavement widening project at New Road on July 17 has elicited mixed reactions. While some citizens harbour doubts and disagreements, people with disabilities have their fingers crossed as well. For Narayani Dawadi, who is visually impaired, the initiative offers hope and apprehension in equal measures. She worries that the Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) might overlook the parameters for disabled-friendly infrastructure and execute the project superficially.Dawadi’s scepticism is not unwarranted. Her distrust stems from her 20 years of experience navigating Kathmandu, where she has become familiar with its footpaths and pavements. Despite this familiarity, she cannot navigate confidently due to the ever-changing, unpredictable condition of the pavements.“I don’t know if I can call the footpaths accessible,” Dawadi says. “There is tactile paving for white cane users but it’s not perfect. Sometimes they guide us to a pole or a tree, and in many places, there are only partial tactile guides, leaving us confused.”Her experience highlights a recurring issue: lack of a reliable, consistent infrastructure for people with disabilities in Kathmandu.The roads and footpaths that appear fine during the day are often damaged or under-construction by the evening, giving people with disabilities a hard time navigating them.Dawadi isn’t entirely critical; she appreciates the KMC’s sidewalk widening projects and regulations on street vending and parking. Areas like Baneshwar have become much easier to navigate, Dawadi says.However, Dawadi hopes the KMC doesn’t just displace street vendors without providing alternatives. “They need options that won’t affect their income; a crackdown won’t work.”Dawadi emphasises that KMC shouldn’t view current projects as a complete solution to make public infrastructure ‘disabled-friendly.’ Issues like half-finished tactile paving, narrow roads, and misplaced poles and tiles need to be addressed. “People with disabilities should be involved in planning,” she says.Rishi Dhakal, 44, a wheelchair user for the past 21 years and president of the Spinal Cord Injury Network Nepal, says that while the KMC has been building new footpaths and pavements with nice bricks and tiles, they often fail to meet the measurements for wheelchair use.Rishi notes that the footpath in Narayantar, between Bagmati Bridge to Jorpati Chowk, has become easier for pedestrians and the visually impaired due to reduced parking and fewer street vendors. But it remains inaccessible for wheelchair users due to a lack of proper slopes.“On many footpaths, especially at crossroads, the slope is not favourable for wheelchairs to climb,” he explains. “The footpath has become just a showpiece.”Rishi and his organisation are working to arrange a meeting with the minister and secretary of the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport to present a memorandum advocating for wheelchair-friendly slopes on Kathmandu’s footpaths. On July 21, Rishi met with the ministry’s Joint Secretary Sushil Babu Dhakal to discuss the next steps.While Rishi appreciates the ongoing work to widen pavements on New Road, he doubts the standard measurements for slopes and inclined planes for wheelchair users will be adhered to, citing KMC’s recent work on footpaths near Tribhuvan International Airport where the slopes are inaccessible.Another wheelchair user, Muskan Adhikari, pointed to a double problem of inaccessibility: footpaths lack slopes, and the sky bridges are not wheelchair-friendly. Moreover, she has faced incidents where vehicles did not stop at crossings when traffic police were absent, leading to several close calls.Rishi’s organisation has also received reports of incidents of wheelchair users being hit by vehicles in the Jorpati area.“The constitution promises accessible infrastructure for people with disabilities to navigate independently, but the current footpaths and infrastructure makes independent travel very difficult,” Adhikari said. “Forget pavements, even government offices are not accessible.”Rishi says that even the Health Ministry is only accessible up to the first floor, “forcing us to wait all day for meetings as ministers do not sit on the first floor.” This lack of accessibility extends to the KMC office itself, which has a metal ramp that is extremely difficult for wheelchair users to use and there is no tactile paving either.Vishwo Shrestha, director at the Blind Youth Association Nepal, reveals that their organisation frequently receives reports of blind and visually impaired individuals falling into sewers and rivers due to inadequate safety measures. In Sukedhara, where several offices catering to the blind community are located, a lack of proper fences along Dhobikhola river had previously resulted in accidents. The association had petitioned the KMC a year and a half ago for guard rails or road safety barriers.“Despite the installation of guard rails, there have been recent cases of individuals falling into the river due to gaps in the barriers,” Shrestha says. Shrestha adds that while not all incidents are reported, they receive two to three cases every two months involving falls into rivers or sewers. Many incidents involving collisions with poles or trees due to poor tactile guidance or uneven footpaths go unreported. “This reflects a major failure of the state’s duty,” he said.Meanwhile, for 36-year-old Radha Kumal, a blind white cane user, problems in footpaths and pavements are just part of the larger problems in the country’s road infrastructure. “We don’t know where the zebra cross begins, and traffic lights are useless for us as we cannot see the colour change,” she says. Many like Kumal hope for audio signals at traffic lights to ensure safe and independent road crossings.Sukhdev Ray, 41, who is deaf and lives in Baneshwar, points out a different but equally critical issue: lack of proper signage. “Without clear directional signs in public spaces like pavements, it’s hard for us to find our destinations,” Ray says. “As I can’t hear, I rely on signs for guidance.”Ray also adds that many traffic lights either malfunction or are ignored by drivers. “Crossing the road can be chaotic,” he notes. “With drivers in a rush and traffic lights often disregarded, I often fear getting hit, like I was the last time.”Ray was hit by a motorcycle while walking at Satdobato four months ago. Though he didn’t suffer major injuries, he is still reminded of the incident while walking on the road. He was also hit by a Safa tempo twice in Bhaisepati in June.Sugam Bhattarai, general secretary of the National Federation of the Disabled Nepal (NFDN), acknowledges that the KMC’s new footpaths and railings are a step forward but “they are usually limited to major areas like New Road and lack comprehensive accessibility features.”According to Bhattarai, in Nepal, the term ‘disabled-friendly’ often translates to just adding tactile paving and a ramp, ticking off an ‘inclusivity checklist’ without genuinely addressing accessibility needs. “What about individuals with deafness or intellectual disabilities?” he questions. The Act Relating to Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 2017, and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD), which Nepal has ratified, mandate accessibility to infrastructure.Article 9 of the UNCRPD says, “States Parties shall take appropriate measures to ensure to persons with disabilities access to the physical environment, transportation, information and communications, and other facilities and services open or provided to the public, both in urban and in rural areas.”Despite these legal frameworks, implementation remains inconsistent.Kumal shared that the ongoing pavement widening project at New Road has uprooted both sides of the road, leaving no alternative paths or assistance for the blind. “There’s no guidance or facilities for us,” she said.Shrestha criticises the KMC’s approach for lacking provisions for the blind and visually impaired. “Construction continues without first ensuring alternative routes or proper information,” he said.Nabin Manandhar, spokesperson for the KMC, assures that their pavement widening project at New Road includes considerations for disability access. “While we’re committed to making footpaths accessible, we’re not yet at the stage where we can address all types of disabilities,” he said.“We’ve just started. We welcome suggestions and acknowledge that we can’t address every issue alone.”Baburam Bhattarai, an expert member at the City Planning Commission under the KMC, emphasised that new projects adhere to disability guidelines. “We are monitoring compliance and plan to address issues with old pavements, including complaints about obstructing electric poles,” he said.However, officials blame funding constraints as a barrier in implementing good ideas.In 2021, the Department of Roads allocated Rs50 million for disabled-friendly pavements. The first phase (1.5km from Putalisadak to Thapathali) was completed, but the second phase at Durbarmarg and Jamal was halted due to budget constraints, according to Narayan Dutta Bhandari, division chief of the Road Division of Kathmandu.Rishi said that they, along with the NFDN, will start monitoring construction across the capital. If the right parameters are not followed, they will negotiate with the KMC, even if it means halting the work, he said.“We’ve learned to navigate the inconveniences in Kathmandu’s pavements and roads, but that doesn’t mean they’re not problematic,” Kumal says. “Accessible infrastructure is our right. While we do our best to adapt, we expect the government to adapt to our needs as well.” \nThe Monetary Policy for Fiscal Year 2024-25 issued last Friday by the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB), the monetary authority of Nepal, is generally hailed as expansionary. Nepal’s stock market responded positively to it, triggering a bull run and circuit breaks on Sunday’s trade, the first day of trading after the policy announcement. The Nepal Stock Exchange Index crossed the 2,700 mark after 29 months.The market seemed to have responded positively to the abolition of the Rs200 million ceiling to institutional investors in margin-type lending by the bank and financial institutions, an extension of the loan repayment period for the construction businesses by the end of December 2024, and provision for uncollateralised loans to those going for foreign employment, among others. These, indeed, are more reactive than well-thought-out sustainable policy responses that are unlikely to deliver desirable impacts on containing the severe recessionary trends faced by the economy.Monetary policy-makingFor decades now, Nepal’s monetary policy formulation has been a ritual orchestration rather than a substantive assertion of legally empowered independence by the NRB. The first compromise on monetary policy independence emanated from the fact that the Nepali currency is strictly pegged with the Indian currency. Pragmatically, the pluses of this arrangement may outweigh the minuses for the Nepali economy, so policymakers are not even considering discontinuing it.First, according to the universally acclaimed monetary theory of the impossible trinity, “a country can’t have a fixed exchange rate, independent monetary policy, and free capital movement all at once”. This means that no monetary policy can be ‘independent’ as long as it is pegged with any other currency. But we continue to embrace this impossibility.Second, the central bank shoulders three distinct responsibilities: Controlling inflation, ensuring financial sector stability through supervision and regulation, and, for all practical purposes, functioning as the government's key development finance agency. This reality has often obviated the NRB from an undivided focus on the 'core' central banking functions of money supply, inflation targeting and aversion to systemic risk.Third, the monetary authority and the monetary policy it brings out are often burdened with undue expectations beyond their jurisdiction and capacity. For example, a monetary policy is expected to come out with stimulus packages to ‘rescue’ the economy reeling down the recession, which could be appropriately addressed only by a bold and creative fiscal policy. The monetary policy can only complement this endeavour by managing financial resources for the same.Fourth and the saddest of all, the central bank is exhausting all its autonomy and energy in utterly un-innovative ritualisation of the tasks it should have shed decades ago. For instance, the directed lending policies in the name of the priority sector, deprived sector or the schemes aimed at financial inclusion should no longer be part of monetary policy since they may give rise to a conflict of interests between the roles of a regulator and concessional development financer. The most striking ambiguity of the sort is manifested in the NRB dilemma in dealing with microfinance institutions.The missesThe Monetary Policy appeared as if the central bank was unaware of the current economic malaise and the sources of recalcitrant stagnation. One major sector where the banks have over-invested in the past and suffocated at present is real estate. Except for raising the credit limit from 50 to 70 percent of the valuation to the homeowners with a ‘proven tax file’, the policy has left the land and housing entrepreneurs completely at bay. With India reducing duties on gold imports by 9 percent, as announced in the country’s annual budget last week, the gold market in Nepal, for better or worse, is going to be impacted differently. It will have a bearing on both investment and foreign exchange reserves. The new monetary policy grossly overlooks this phenomenon.Despite repeating a decade-old idea of setting up a second-tier oversight institution to regulate the saving and credit cooperatives and streamlining the operations of the microfinance institutions, the policy has blatantly failed to reinvigorate the small-and-medium-enterprise (SME) ecosystem. At present, the SMEs of Nepal face a grave crisis of legal/official recognition that has, in turn, impeded their access to formal financing mechanisms.The Economic Census of Nepal 2018 has shown that out of 923,356 establishments, only 462,605, or 50.1 percent, are registered. The rest—49.9 percent—have no legal identity. These are important entities providing self-employment and livelihood support to a large population. However, they have hardly any scope to find sizable investments and scale up their operations to enable them to reap the benefits of economies of scale. Again, it must not be misconstrued that the central bank should be directly involved in financing these SMEs. However, as a policy-maker, it should make functional arrangements by engaging relevant stakeholders like the subnational governments to facilitate and recognise grassroots businesses. This reflects the glaring gap in the public policymaking mindset that devolved financial power under federal polity can help optimise implementation, including monetary policy.Flimsy approachSome haphazard and over-ambitious policies have only eroded the central bank’s credibility as the regulator. A provision not to blacklist the contractors deliberately issuing bank checks without adequate balance in their accounts is in direct contravention of the best universal practices in banking.The monetary policy proposes to support the government in achieving an economic growth rate of 6 percent, as proposed by the budget of the current fiscal year, through liquidity management and credit disbursement towards the productive sector. It projects the broad money supply to be at 12.0 percent and credit disbursement to the private sector to grow at 12.5 percent. This means an increase of about Rs660 billion from the current Rs5.3 trillion disbursements of loans.The target is clearly to invest about Rs700 billion worth of loanable funds now lying idle in the system. This is a huge ask considering that during 11 months of the last fiscal year, loans from banks to the private sector increased only by 5.1 percent.The policy also fails to address the risk of alarmingly increasing non-performing assets in the banking system, making the banks more hesitant to invest aggressively. Such policy orchestration does not support the wider agenda of overdue structural reform of the financial system.  \nWhen the Ranjitkar group was established, they discovered this forgotten dance and devoted two years to researching it.Now, they are reintroducing it during Indra Jatra by training the new generation in this traditional art form. \nHe is known for his nationalist legacy, marked by the amendment of Nepal's map to include territories like Kalapani, Lipulekh, and Limpiyadhura, and his strong stance against India, especially during and after the 2015 Nepal blockade.But how did he rise to become the country's powerful man? \nPyakuryal holds a Phd in Public Affairs from the University of Akron, US. In this interview, they discuss Nepal’s elusive political stability, the narratives governing Nepali politics, the role of patriarchy, and the trends in Nepali politics Pyakuryal will be closely following in the years ahead. \n\nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli has told the members of the parliamentary State Affairs and Good Governance Committee that he wouldn’t engage in any kind of corruption nor will he tolerate such activities.Oli was charged with ‘policy corruption’ in the Giri Bandhu tea estate scam, mainly by the Nepali Congress, before the formation of the current government. Nepali Congress is now the main coalition partner in the Oli government.While participating in the meeting to discuss amendments to the bill related to the Prevention of Corruption Act-2002 at the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee on Tuesday, Oli claimed that all allegations against him in corruption were attempts to smear him.“I have never committed corruption in my life,” Oli said. “I do not tolerate corruption… Corruption committed beyond my notice is a different matter.”Oli’s claim comes less than two months after he was scrutinised for his alleged involvement in the tea estate land swap scam. In early June, pressure mounted in Parliament to investigate the Oli government's decision to permit the Giri Bandhu tea estate in Jhapa to swap its land with plots elsewhere in the Koshi province. Many political parties in Parliament were zeroing in on the idea that the multi-billion-rupee scam must be probed.The Supreme Court on February 7 overturned the erstwhile Oli government’s decision on the tea estate land swap. On April 26, 2021, a government led by Oli, who is also the CPN-UML chairman, allowed the tea estate to reap benefits from land holdings above the legal ceiling.The Supreme Court’s full text of the verdict on the tea estate, issued on May 12, had sparked political and legal debates. Subsequently, Nepali Congress, the main opposition at the time, demanded an investigation into the decision-making process of the land swap permit.The Congress's parliamentary party meeting on May 14 officially clarified its position and demanded an investigation into the issue. But after the change in coalition partners following the Congress-UML midnight deal on July 1 the tea estate issue has taken a back seat.Hitraj Pandey, the chief whip of CPN (Maoist Centre) and a member of the committee, doubts the prime minister's claims.Pandey alleges that the present coalition of the Congress and the UML was formed as the two largest parties were afraid of the earlier Maoist-led government's zero tolerance of corruption. Therefore, Oli, who leads the Congress-UML government, is not serious about corruption control, Pandey argues.Former coalition partners Maoist Centre and Rastriya Swatantra Party claim that after their government detained Bechan Jha, who was linked to the fake Bhutanese refugee issue, the Congress and the UML had teamed up to topple the earlier government.Corruption control is best served by action—not words, Pandey told the Post. He also claimed to have said the same thing to Prime Minister Oli upon completion of his address.Chitra Bahadur KC of Rastriya Janamorcha said that Oli saying he won’t indulge in corruption is not a new thing. KC is a committee member, who was a deputy prime minister during Oli’s first prime ministerial stint in 2015.Corruption has become a trend in Nepal, KC told the Post. “It cannot be prevented only by laws while leaders continue to commit it.”Meanwhile, during his address to the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee, Prime Minister Oli said that effective corruption control and prevention is necessary to drive the country on the path of development. He added that the government would amend laws related to corruption to maintain good governance.“I would like to assure all the lawmakers that there will be no corruption from my side,” Oli said. The prime minister said that the government would take strict action against corrupt people. This is Oli’s first participation in a meeting of the parliamentary committee after becoming the prime minister on July 15.On July 31, Oli was summoned to the committee to discuss the ‘peace and security and prison management’ agenda. However, he sent Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak to the meeting, citing his busy schedule. \nIn Nepali Congress, the position of general secretary is considered the second most powerful after the party president.Historically, some charismatic leaders have held the position in the country’s grand old party: from Krishna Prasad Bhattarai in the 1950s, to Mahendra Narayan Nidhi, Girija Prasad Koirala, to now the duo of Gagan Thapa and Bishwa Prakash Sharma.When two relatively younger and popular leaders—Thapa and Sharma—got elected as general secretaries in December 2021, they had kindled hope among young Congress members and well-wishers of the party.But over time, they have failed to implement their agendas as the establishment led by party chief Deuba is dominant. Political analysts and observers, too, say that Thapa and Sharma have failed to reflect the strength of their popular mandate in the party decision making process.Prior to its 14th general convention, the party had the provision of one elected general secretary whereas the other was nominated by the party President after the general convention. In the last convention, the party amended its statute and made it mandatory to elect both the general secretaries and other party bearers through voting.With Thapa and Sharma elected as the Congress general secretaries, they were expected to challenge the septuagenarian party President Sher Bahadur Deuba.However, as a party insider claims, the general secretary duo themselves are struggling to create their space in party leadership. This struggle is a testament to the challenges they face in cementing their influence in the Congress, says a party leader.“The party’s general secretary is usually occupied with official work,” Prakash Sharan Mahat, a Congress spokesperson, told the Post. “How active they are in the party’s internal affairs is not something I can comment on.”After being elected as the party’s general secretaries, Thapa and Sharma have publicly spoken about being kept in the dark on vital matters. For instance, while speaking at the 42nd BP Memorial programme held on July 20, Thapa said the July 1 agreement between Congress and CPN-UML reached to form a new coalition government came as a surprise.Purushottam Dahal, a senior journalist close to the Congress, says the two general secretaries didn’t understand their exact role.“The general secretary’s role is to make the party’s central secretariat functional, but they are trying to be reactionary, which is inappropriate,” Dahal told the Post. “To make the party functional, they should not wait for a green signal from the party president.”However, General Secretary Sharma rubbishes such a claim.“There have been some transformative changes in the party after we assumed the role of general secretaries,” Sharma told the Post. “From establishing a library in the party’s central office to holding the BP Koirala Literature Festival, we have made the party more vibrant.”He argued that what has happened is that the duo have failed to publicise some of their important works.The general secretaries claim they are facing difficulties because of the party leadership’s working style, but some leaders don’t buy that argument.Sharma further claims that their work is often hindered by the generational gap with Deuba.“In addition, both of us general secretaries were elected from different panels during the general convention, which caused some misunderstanding among party leaders,” Sharma said.But there are other Congress leaders who accuse the general secretaries of suddenly turning risk-averse. “They are bound by the party statute as the party follows a presidential system where the president prevails over others,” Govinda Pokharel, a newly appointed head of the Economic Policy and Planning Department of the Congress, told the Post. “However, the two general secretaries cannot accommodate all groups in the party, and hence their difficulties.” According to Pokharel, after becoming the party’s office bearers, they are slowly turning cautious. “Although they have a very popular base and they also have content-based knowledge on development, they are not being able to use their potential.” Sharma differs.“We have challenged the party leadership on many issues to establish our agenda,” Sharma said. “At the party’s Mahasamiti meeting in February, we successfully proposed contesting the upcoming election with the party’s own strength… The party's central committee meeting, which will commence on Wednesday, will pass our proposal as it is.” A Congress leader close to General Secretary Thapa, however, acknowledged that Thapa is sometimes clueless about the party’s functioning.“From the beginning, the general secretaries have not been able to mobilise the leaders in their fold effectively,” Shankar Tiwari, a Congress youth leader close to Thapa, told the Post. “Sometimes they prevail over the party president, but on many other occasions they are also at his mercy.”Meanwhile, a few Congress leaders claim that the popularity of the general secretaries duo is diminishing, which could make it difficult for them to elevate themselves in party politics in the coming days. There are ample examples where Congress leaders lost their revolutionary spirit after becoming general secretary, says the leader.Only three past general secretaries of Congress have succeeded in becoming party chief and the prime minister. Krishna Prasad Bhattarai was the general secretary of the party soon after the establishment of democracy in Nepal in 1950. Likewise, Girija Prasad Koirala, another general secretary during the 1990s, later became the prime minister as well as the party President. Sushil Koirala was the third general secretary to become party president, and the prime minister. Jagat Nepal, a long-time Congress observer, says that apart from the prime minister, two of the Congress’s general secretaries have become the country’s President, if not party president and prime minister. “Ram Baran Yadav, the first President of the country, and Ramchandra Paudel, the current President, both were once the party’s general secretary,” Nepal told the Post. Besides, Taranath Ranabhat, the former general secretary of the party, and Paudel became Speakers of the House of Representatives in the 1990s.Nepal added that despite not being elevated to the party’s top position, a few former general secretaries of Congress had played an important role in national politics. “We can’t draw a sweeping conclusion that leaders lose their influence after becoming general secretary,” he said.Apart from the leaders mentioned above, Mahendra Narayan Nidhi, Krishna Prasad Sitaula, Prakash Man Singh, Sashank Koirala, and Purna Bahadur Khadka were the few among others who took up the responsibility of the general secretary.“As far as why they were not able to lift themselves to the top position is concerned, sometimes, despite their personal efficiency, circumstances might not be favourable,” Dahal, the senior journalist, said.General Secretary Sharma echoes Dahal.In the past, the party president used to nominate one of the two general secretaries. In such a case, the nominated general secretary would obviously not be able to challenge the party chief, Sharma said. From the 14th general convention, the party started to elect both general secretaries through voting by party delegates. \n“Factionalism is unacceptable in our party,” Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, who also chairs the CPN-UML, said at a party meeting on Sunday.Some people might provoke factional feuds on the pretext of strengthening internal democracy in the party, but that is not allowed in the UML, Oli said. “Some of you might take it lightly, arguing that we have heard such dictats since a long time ago,” Oli emphasised. “But it is not something to ignore. It is something to heed seriously.”Oli cautioned the party members against groupism in the party, while administering the oath to the newly appointed vice-chair of the party, Guru Baral, two standing committee members, Mukunda Neupane and Lilanath Shrestha, and 17 central committee members at the party’s central office in Chasyal, Lalitpur on Sunday.Though Chairman Oli ruled against promoting factional activities within the party, some UML leaders accuse him for giving rise to factionalism.It is common practice worldwide to pursue a “two-line struggle” in a communist party. During the party convention, rival leaders often present parallel political documents.While the incumbent party chief presents a political paper, those from the anti-establishment camp float a different paper to counter its ideas. This eventually sets the ground for a two-line struggle in a communist party. Though communists tried to sugarcoat the two-line struggle as a way to rejuvenate party activities and strengthen intra-party democracy, political analysts say such exercise is limited to propping up factions. For Nepali politicians, factions are platforms to exercise power. “When two or more leaders with parallel influential groups exist within the party, that often results in factionalism,” Keshav Dahal, a political analyst, told the Post. “But when there are no leaders to challenge the party’s top leader, there remain fewer chances for groupism.”After a group of UML leaders under former party chiefs Madhav Kumar Nepal and Jhala Nath Khanal split the party to form the CPN (Unified Socialist) in 2021, there was no one to openly challenge Oli. Therefore, the UML doesn’t have a faction now running activities parallel to the party establishment from the centre to the grassroots, which used to be the case in the past.Oli was the one who led a strong faction for many years when Nepal or Khanal was the party chief. Then, why is Oli himself afraid of factional activities in the party?UML leaders say there are no reasons for the party chair to fear from an exercise of intra-party democracy if the top leaders don’t promote factional activities.“It is the duty of the party leader not to engage in factionalism within the party, rather than urging party members not to do so,” Usha Kiran Timilsina, a central committee member of the UML, told the Post. “If the leadership does not promote this, party members will automatically avoid factionalism.”Another UML leader lambasted Oli for being the party's arbitrary leader and a promoter of groupism.A UML standing committee member said the party’s central secretariat meeting on August 1 showed favouritism while deciding a work division among top leaders. He claimed that leaders close to Oli and General Secretary Shankar Pokharel got important responsibilities while others were sidelined.When Prithvi Subba Gurung, the minister for communication and information technology in the Oli Cabinet, is relieved of party responsibilities after becoming minister, Finance Minister Bishnu Paudel of the same Cabinet is given the party’s responsibility as well, the leader told the Post, requesting anonymity.According to the work division decided last week, Paudel still coordinates the monitoring of the party’s organisational activities. Gurung had earlier got the responsibility of leading the party’s parliamentary affairs department. Now Gurung heads no department in the UML.The newly appointed central committee members are loyal to party chair Oli and General Secretary Pokharel, the leader claimed.But Krishna Bhakta Pokharel, who was sworn in as a central member on Sunday, ruled out factionalism in the party. “It was not groupism that party chair Oli pointed to while administering the oath to us,” Pokharel told the Post. “The party chair only tried to make party members aware of the possible foul play against the UML.”Despite being one of the organising members of the 10th general convention of the UML held in Chitwan in November 2021, Pokharel, who earlier was a central committee member and two-time lawmaker, was excluded from the committee.Left-leaning analysts also claim that there is intense rivalry between various groups at the provincial level even if there is no vertical division at present.“But the party is not free from groups exercising parallel activities within the organisation,” Jhalak Subedi, a left-leaning political analyst, told the Post.Political analyst Dahal also claims that even though there are no leaders in UML to challenge the party chair at present, there are struggles between party leaders to project themselves as being close to Oli. The tussle visible among second-rung leaders while picking the chief minister in Lumbini is the latest case in point.When the Congress and the UML decided to form the Lumbini provincial government under the UML’s leadership, many saw UML’s Lumbini Assembly leader Leela Giri as a natural candidate for chief minister.However, Chet Nath Acharya, the deputy leader of the assembly, was appointed the chief minister on July 22. Giri is close to party vice-chair Bishnu Paudel while Acharya is loyal to Pokharel. As General Secretary Pokharel is closer to Oli, the party chief directly instructed Lumbini assembly members of the UML to support Acharya—not Giri. “We are not sure why the party selected Acharya instead of Giri, but we believe it was due to the rivalry between party vice-chair Paudel and General Secretary Pokharel,” a provincial assembly member then told the Post on the condition of anonymity.“Due to the personal rivalry between Paudel and Pokharel, Acharya got the opportunity despite Giri having been considered the chief minister.”During the party's provincial convention held in September last year, Paudel and Pokharel were fiercely engaged in electing leaders loyal to them as the provincial committee chair. The same rivalry was evident while electing the chief minister, according to the leader.Soon after the appointment, Giri had said that if central leaders try to embrace their close supporters while sidelining others, that could sow the seeds of groupism in the party.However, when the Post contacted Giri on Sunday, he refused to comment on the selection of the chief ministerial candidate.Party insiders said that just like the Paudel-Pokharel rivalry in Lumbini, there are similar exercises in other regions as well. For instance, senior leaders Gurung and Khagraj Adhikari are vying for a grip on the party committees in Gandaki Province. \nThe rhythmic beat of the Dha echoes through a Bhaktapur alley, blending with the energetic footsteps of dancers. Bhaktapur, which sees jatras and festivals round the year, is no stranger to music, dance and celebrations. But this is not an ordinary occasion. The performers in question are Lakhe dancers who are reviving the Ranjitkar Lakhe dance after a century.The young dancers are preparing for Indra Jatra this year, where mask-clad Lakhe dancers roam the streets to rid the community of hardships and suffering. Lakhe, demon deities revered as protectors of people and crops, are thought to reside in the demonic mask. As the dancer dons the mask, the spirit is said to take over.Bhaktapur was once a key site for the Ranjitkar Lakhe performances, but the art form vanished from the city after the 1934 earthquake.“Bhaktapur suffered the most damage during the 1934 earthquake,\" says Ganesh Ram Ranjit, treasurer of the Ranjitkar Group’s Bhaktapur branch. “The destruction left residents struggling to recover for a decade, making it nearly impossible to perform the costly Lakhe dance.”The Ranjitkar Group discovered the extinct dance in the year the group was established. They located a Lakhe temple in Bhaktapur that had closed after the earthquake. After two years of research, they learned that performing the Lakhe dance was seen as a good omen in Bhaktapur and involved hosting community feasts. However, the high cost of this tradition forced many to sell their properties, rendering it unfeasible in the city’s post-earthquake conditions. Over time, the dance was abandoned as more lands supporting these cultural events were lost during rapid urbanisation.“There was a significant decline in our engagement with our cultural heritage,” says Rabi Shakya, a sculptor and Lakhe dance teacher training the new dancers. “The encouraging change now is the strong interest from the new generation, which is making it possible to revive intangible heritage like this dance.”After 100 years, the Ranjitkar Lakhe Dance is making a return to Bhaktapur at this year’s Indra Jatra.“It’s challenging to accurately re-enact the dance since it hasn’t been seen in a century,” Shakya notes. “As a sculptor, I drew inspiration from Bhaktapur’s revered Shree Navadurga Bhawani to create the Lakhe’s mask.” Similarly, the dance was choreographed by studying Lakhe dances from Kathmandu, Patan, and Banepa within the Ranjitkar community, and combining them with traditional steps from Bhaktapur Lakhe dances.“As for the musical instruments, we are using traditional instruments like Dha, Dhime, and Ponga, which are said to excite the Lakhe,” says Rajendra Maharjan, Lakhe dance teacher and musician.Maharjan is one of the experienced Newari arts teachers working to revive the lost Lakhe dance. He is involved in training young students in cultural arts and is now dedicated to the Ranjitkar dance training, with the students practising together nearly every day.“Becoming a Lakhe performer involves more than just wearing the costume and mask,” said Sudin Ranjit, a Lakhe dance student. “We must train extensively with our teachers, and it demands a lot of hard work.”To Ranjit, a resident of Bhaktapur, the training is more than learning a new craft; it is a matter of protecting culture. Growing up only interested in instruments, he slowly understood how important continuing cultural practices like Lakhe dances is for their community.“The dance will not only bolster Bhaktapur’s cultural pride but also boost tourism and create jobs,” says Dr Purushottam Lochan Shrestha, a professor and researcher specialising in Bhaktapur and Newari culture.Shrestha notes that reviving the dance would offer employment to everyone involved, from the dancers and the sculptor making the masks to those participating in the rituals. “Economic centres throughout the city, from small businesses to large industries, will benefit from the influx of tourists attracted by the Lakhe dance,” Shrestha adds, commending the Ranjitkar group's initiative.Once the Ranjitkar community revitalises the Lakhe dance, the Ranjitkar group plans to set up a new Guthi house with a fresh community fund and organise annual events for the dance.“The Lakhe dance won’t let them separate,” Shakya remarks.In today’s globalised world, where identity often merges into a homogenised blend, shared cultural practices provide a sense of connection and belonging. This new Lakhe dance embodies that spirit of togetherness for the community involved.“Reviving the dance after 100 years,” Shakya says, “is about preserving our culture for the next 300 years.” \nThe Lions Club of Kathmandu Corporate, Nepal MD325-D has felicitated various personalities as part of its endeavour to recognise the contribution of the individuals and business entities for the society.As part of its campaign, the Lions Club of Kathmandu honoured Prateek Pradhan with Social Journalism Award, Sylapa T Rimponche with Social Spiritual Award, Erika Gurung with Social Player Award, Ramesh Corporation with Social Corporate House Award, Rajendra Malla with Social Corporate Leader Award and Rajesh Hamal with Social Celebrity Award.Likewise, Chandra Ghimire is honoured with Social Bureaucratic Award, Binod Das with Sports Management Award, Anil Kedia with Social Academic Award, Mohan Ojha with Social Management Award and Surya Nepal with Corporate Social Responsibility Award.The Lionism embarked in Nepal in 1971 as the Lions Club of Biratnagar under the stewardship of former Prime Minister Matrika Prasad Koirala.The Lions Clubs International says it has over 2,000 clubs operating across the nation. \nThe government has declared a public holiday in the Kathmandu Valley on Sunday to celebrate the Bhoto Jatra.On the occasion of the festival, a public holiday has been declared in the three districts of Kathmandu Valley [Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur], according to a statement by Narayan Prasad Bhattarai, spokesperson for the Ministry of Home Affairs, on Friday.The government announces a public holiday each year on this occasion.The month-long chariot-pulling festival of Rato Machhindranath concludes with the displaying of a bhoto (a jewel-studded vest) at Jawalakhel, Lalitpur. It is an annual cultural and religious ritual of displaying the black jewel-studded vest believed to be of then Nagraj, the serpent King.Machhindranath is revered as the God of rain, good harvest and prosperity. Paying homage to Lord Machhindranath is believed to bring good luck and fulfil one’s wishes. \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City has resumed pavement widening in the New Road area from Wednesday. Officials at the Public Construction Department under the metropolis said that the contractor resumed the work after the High Court, Patan issued an interim order paving the way for following an interim order from the High Court, Patan allowing the work to proceed. “Now there is no obstruction from locals nor from federal government agencies,” said Baburam Bhattarai, a member of the City Planning Commission under the KMC. “We hope that the project will be completed at the earliest.”The metropolis had awarded a contract to widen the sidewalks by 1.5 metres along both sides of the road section between the New Road gate and the Juddha Statue roundabout in the last fiscal year. The work started in the New Road area in May, but a jurisdictional dispute between the city office and the Road Division, Kathmandu, caused the project to come to a halt. The division confiscated contractors’ equipment, and the federal government deployed police in to prevent the city office from working. Some local residents, too, had demonstrated against the pavement widening plan. The division had even repaired the parts of roads cut for pavement expansion.And on June 9, the metropolis moved the High Court challenging the breach of jurisdiction by the road division, which is a federal agency, and its intervention in the city’s work.City officials were already frustrated by the years-long delay by federal agencies in completing another project, the widening of Kathmandu’s Ring Road in the Kalanki-Maharajgunj section, which has caused huge inconvenience to the public due to dust and mud.Mayor Balendra Shah then directed city officials to dump truckloads of dirt from the Ring Road section in front of the main entrance of the Road Division office at Minbhawan, accusing federal agencies of delaying the work.The 8.2km Kalanki-Maharajgunj section was set to be widened by the Chinese government, and the work was initially planned to start in early 2020, but the project has not progressed even after years due to Covid and delays in clearing the power poles and in some cases structures along the right of way.Regarding the jurisdiction dispute over the sidewalk widening work in the city, a division bench of judges Dhurba Raj Nand and Prakash Kharel at the High Court Patan issued an interim order in favour of the metropolis on Sunday.The City office has already widening pavements by 1 metre on both sides in the Bhrikutimandap area. “Neither did the federal government agency intervene, nor did locals object while expanding pavement in the Bhrikutimandap area by narrowing the road,” said Bhattarai. “Further decisions on pavement widening in other areas like Thamel, Handigaun and others will be taken after collecting public feedback.”Officials said that the long-term plan is to restrict motor vehicles altogether in the New Road area due to heavy pedestrian traffic. “We have also been working to find a solution to the parking problem and weighing various options including setting up multi-storey parking facilities,” said Bhattarai, who is also an urban planner.Officials said that pavements in the New Road area, which always remain crowded, should be widened to ensure free pedestrian movement. Officials claimed that New Road residents have also requested the city office to expand the pavement.According to city officials, local residents have, from time to time, complained about feeling unsafe and experiencing sexual harassment on the narrow and crowded sidewalks. \nLaxmi InterContinental Pvt.

On Monday, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled amid massive anti-government protests.“It’s more than 15 days since cargo trucks from Bangladesh have not moved. The containers ready to be dispatched from Nepal are on hold,” said Rajendra Sangraula, senior vice president of the Nepal Freight Forwarders Association. “There will be cargo movement until the situation returns to normal.”Banglabandha is a major inland port in northern Bangladesh that was established to provide a trade link with Nepal through the Asian highway. The three nations are separated by the Siliguri Corridor, a 52km stretch of Indian territory. Phulbari is on the Indian side of the border.The Siliguri Corridor, also called 'Chicken's Neck,' connects India's northeastern states to the rest of the country. Bangladesh and Nepal lie on either side of the corridor, and Bhutan lies on the northern side.Bilateral trade between Nepal and Bangladesh began to increase after the Kakarbhitta-Phulbari-Banglabandha transit route was opened on August 31, 1997.“We used to receive 20–25 cargo trucks from Bangladesh at normal times,” said Sangraula.Traders said that despite having potential trade opportunities with Bangladesh, exports have remained minimal due to 35 percent import duty levied by the country.Sangraula said Nepal has been majorly importing jute, a raw material for garments, and branded readymade garments like Nike and Adidas, among others.Nepali traders who have already opened Letters of Credit (LC) will have to wait to receive their ordered goods.Sangraula said the domestic industry, which depends on raw materials imported from Bangladesh, will be mostly affected. Producers might also need to look for other markets amid the crisis in Bangladesh. The total trade between Nepal and Bangladesh is Rs4.78 billion. Nepal’s imports from Bangladesh declined by 30.13 percent in the last fiscal year ended on July 15. According to the Department of Customs, Nepal’s imports fell to Rs4.22 billion in the past year.Export, too, declined by 3.37 percent to Rs554.66 million in the review period. Nepal faced a trade deficit of Rs3.67 billion with Bangladesh in the period. Nepal has been facing a trade deficit with Bangladesh since 2014-15.In the last fiscal year, Nepal majorly imported raw jute, medicine, lead-acid accumulators, oil cakes and other solid residues of soybeans, toilet paper, and juice.Sangraula said that, in the long term, the changes in the government system might impact the bilateral agreement, which has been in the works for 15 years. It will also affect the Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Nepal Motor Vehicle Agreements.“If the crisis continues for a long period, it will have repercussions on trade. But as in Sri Lanka, the situation in Bangladesh may eventually get normal,” said Paras Kharel, executive director of the South Asia Watch on Trade, Economics and Environment.A trade expert said that Bangladesh holds a considerable export potential for Nepal, but this has yet to be realised. Currently, Nepal exports most of the lentils it produces to Bangladesh.Kharel said the new government in Bangladesh might not give much importance to BBIN and BIMSTEC. “The trade between two countries might remain the same, with no progress in the coming days.”Kharel said the electricity import might also be on hold for some time, but as it is their need, it will be continued.In June, Bangladesh's Cabinet Committee on Government Purchase approved a proposal by the Bangladesh Power Development Board to import 40 MW of electricity from Nepal.Nepal plans to sell 144,000 MWh (megawatt-hour) of electricity in five months at 6.4 cents (US dollar) a unit.Nepal will transmit the energy to India through the 400KV Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur cross-border transmission line before India transmits the equivalent to Bangladesh. A study conducted by SAWTEE on Nepal-Bangladesh trade shows that Nepal's exports to Bangladesh have been limited to agricultural products, with lentils making up approximately 90 percent of exports over the past five years.As Nepal moves closer to graduating from the Least Developed Country (LDC) status, exploring alternative markets to mitigate the impact of tariff increment in some of its major trade destinations becomes crucial. According to the report, there is substantial potential for strengthening bilateral trade ties with Bangladesh.Experts have said that the proposed preferential trade agreement, which has been discussed since 2019, could remove this constraint, but Bangladesh faces various challenges.This year, too, a commerce secretary-level meeting between Nepal and Bangladesh held in Kathmandu in April to strengthen economic ties could not reach a conclusion on the much-delayed bilateral preferential trade agreement between the two neighbours.Since 2015, Nepal and Bangladesh have been mulling to establish direct bus services between their respective capitals.The distance between Kathmandu and Dhaka is more than 1,184 km, and the bus journey is expected to take 24 hours.The proposed route extends from Dhaka to Banglabandha (510 km), Banglabandha to Kakkarbhitta, Nepal via Panitanki (56 km) and Kakkarbhitta to Kathmandu (618 km). The trip from Kakkarbhitta to Kathmandu takes around 11 hours. \nFor the past five days, every TV screen in Nepal has been displaying a message: Dear customers, due to a sudden and unforeseen problem with the channel distributor, international channels like Sony, Star, Zee, and Icast are currently unavailable.” Cable and internet TV operators have apologised for the disruption and assured that they would resolve the matter. Consumer rights activists say that consumers are being cheated under various pretexts.Nepali operators say that delays in approving the à la carte pricing guidelines by the Finance Ministry led the Indian broadcaster to cut some channels from cable and internet TV services last Thursday evening. “As the dues piled up due to the delays by the government in giving approval to the pricing guidelines, the Indian Broadcasting and Digital Foundation decided to cut channel services in Nepal,” said Sudhir Parajuli, president of the Federation of Nepal Cable Television Association.The Indian Broadcasting and Digital Foundation is a unified representative body of TV broadcasters and over-the-top platforms in India. Over-the-top platforms are streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, among others, that deliver content over the internet directly to viewers.Before the à la carte system, broadcasters and distributors would reach an agreement and sign a contract that included pricing details, said Parajuli. “With the implementation of the à la carte system, new pricing guidelines were required.”In August last year, the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology formally implemented the “pick-and-pay” option for Nepali television viewers.“Since the Indian broadcasters were initially not ready to adopt the à la carte system, we were also in a dilemma. Eventually, the government strictly enforced the system.”The Ministry of Communications then prepared and sent the tariff guidelines to the Ministry of Finance. “It took a while for the Ministry of Finance to give its approval,” said Parajuli.The Ministry of Finance finally gave its approval to the guidelines last Thursday and sent them to the Ministry of Communications, said Parajuli.“The distributors have not been able to pay the Indian broadcasters for the last 14 months. The outstanding dues amount to Rs500 million,” Parajuli said. The Ministry of Communications could not issue foreign exchange recommendations for distributors to pay their Indian vendors because the guidelines had been stalled.“Now that the guidelines have been approved, services will resume within a few days,” Parajuli said.Government officials claimed they were unaware of the issue.The secretary at the Ministry of Communications, Radhika Aryal, said she was unaware of the issue because she had been newly appointed to the ministry.The Post's multiple attempts to reach the ministry spokesperson Gajendra Thakur were unsuccessful.Officials from the Department of Information and Broadcasting, also said they were unaware of the issue.The à la carte system allows viewers to choose and pay only for the channels they want to watch. This allows viewers to watch their favourite channels and pay only for those, rather than the whole package that includes channels they rarely watch. The Ministry of Communications has fixed a minimum monthly fee of Rs250 per customer for cable television to cover carrying costs.This model is used in countries like India, the United States, and Canada.According to the federation, there are eight cable TV operators, including internet TV providers in Nepal. Around 110 Nepali channels and 98 foreign channels are broadcast in Nepal, serving around 1.5 million subscribers who have renewed their subscriptions. Service providers pay monthly fees to both the distributor and to the Indian broadcasters. “We have been paying the distributor every month, but the distributor has not received foreign exchange approvals from the Ministry of Communications,” said Parajuli.According to the federation, the Indian broadcaster has suspended all packages from Zee, Sony, Colours, and Star across the country. If some customers still have access to these channels, then it must be pirated.Currently, TV channels in Nepal are broadcast through direct-to-home, multiple-system operators, multichannel multipoint distribution services, internet protocol television, and digital terrestrial television, among other methods.“Customers pay in advance for cable TV services, but the service has been interrupted for five days, and there is no sign of resumption. This is a total scam,” said Prem Lal Maharjan, president of the National Consumers Forum.“Who is responsible for this, and who will compensate for this?” He demanded that the service providers compensate the customers for the disruption. \nIn a bid to address growing mental health problems in children and adolescents, the Ministry of Health and Population has decided to train health workers to examine their mental health conditions.Officials said that as many as 150 health workers, including medical officers, nurses and paramedics, will be trained to screen the mental health conditions of this age group within the current fiscal year.“We hope that the health worker training programme will help lessen existing mental health problems in children and adolescents,” said Dr Pomawati Thapa, chief of the Non-communicable Disease and Mental Health Section at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Those serving in primary health care centres will be trained first so that children and adolescents from villages will get access to the services easily.”A report of the National Mental Health Survey Nepal-2020 shows that the prevalence of mental disorders among adolescents was 5.2 percent that year, and the neurotic and stress-related disorders were the most prevalent at 2.8 percent.Likewise, the prevalence of current suicidal thoughts among adolescents was around four percent, while suicidal attempt in the same age group was 0.7 percent. The same report also shows that 0.6 percent of children and adolescents were found to have been suffering from depression.The prevalence of suicidality, including current suicidal thoughts, lifetime suicidal attempts and future likelihood of suicidal thoughts, was found to be prevalent in the 7.2 percent population.Experts say that mental health problems in children and adolescents could be several times more than what the survey portrays. They say that around 10 to 15 percent of the total children and adolescent population could have been suffering from various types of mental health issues, and due to methodological problems, the survey could not portray actual problems.“Children and adolescents could suffer from various types of mental health problems, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, depression, conduct disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder,” said Dr Arun Kunwar, child and adolescent psychiatrist. “But very few parents and teachers realise the problems and seek medical attention. Children get scolded and beaten both at schools and at home.”A study carried out by the Nepal Health Research Council in the past shows that about 13 percent of Nepalis suffer from some form of mental disorder. This means around one in eight Nepalis have mental health issues. Moreover, the country simply does not have enough experts to treat mental health problems, it added.Health officials said that there are only around half a dozen child and adolescent psychiatric doctors in the country, and only a few are serving in state-run health facilities. Similarly, the major contributors to the treatment gap are societal beliefs, traditions and stigma associated with mental disorders, according to experts.“This training will help health workers notice problems and refer patients to health facilities with child psychiatrists and psychologists,” said Thapa.Studies show the magnitude of suffering, the burden and costs for individuals, families and societies arising from mental health disorders are alarming in Nepal.The World Health Organisation says that one in four people in the world has been affected by mental or neurological disorders at some point in their lives, and around 450 million people currently suffer from such conditions, placing mental disorders among the leading causes of ill health and disability worldwide. \nA bi-weekly situation update published by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division on Monday shows one death from the dengue disease and over 300 positive cases. Since the start of this year, the number of people infected with the virus has reached 2,365.Public health experts warn that the death toll and case numbers could go up further in the coming days. They criticise the authorities for their narrow approach—focussing solely on counting cases and deaths, which does little to control the outbreak of the deadly disease.“The authorities have neither conducted risk mapping nor taken measures to lessen the spread of the deadly virus,” said Dr Baburam Marasini, former director at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Counting cases and deaths is not enough. Even the reported figures are far from reflecting the actual scale of the outbreak.”Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika, according to the World Health Organisation.“Dengue virus is not like the coronavirus, which spread all over the world suddenly,” said Dr Biraj Karmacharya, an infectious disease expert who is also the administrative head of Dhulikhel Hospital. “We can use the existing data for risk mapping, step up surveillance, and predict disease outbreaks accordingly.”Experts say the disease will not stop spreading unless the lessons and experiences gained in previous outbreaks are implemented. They say the real number of infections could be several times higher, as the government’s case reporting system is not very effective, and more than 80 percent of the cases are asymptomatic.Even symptomatic patients do not seek treatment at the hospital unless their symptoms get severe. What concerns them much is that many patients take non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs—Flexon tablets, Nims, and Rynex, among others—to cure body aches caused by the dengue infection. Using such drugs is very risky during dengue infection.Doctors warn that using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to treat dengue can increase the risk of internal bleeding, including in the eyes, elevate enzyme levels and damage the liver.Some patients who use NSAIDs in excess also suffer internal bleeding. Such patients need to transfuse platelet-rich plasma and platelet concentrate, according to them.Health agencies concerned have been shifting responsibilities to other agencies that are ill-equipped and lacking in both financial and human resources.“Every day, 16 to 17 people in our district get infected with the dengue virus,” said Dr Arjun Sapkota, chief of the Health Office, Kathmandu. Health agencies at the local level have been asked to launch a dengue search and destroy campaign and ramp up awareness about the risks.”Experts say most local units lack the budget and human resources to launch preventive measures. They say that a massive awareness campaign is instrumental in destroying the breeding ground of the dengue-spreading vector, and the public must be made aware of the treatment.Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms, which do not need any treatment or can be treated with paracetamol at home. Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects such as plastic cups and bottles could be breeding grounds for dengue-carrying mosquitoes.According to doctors, mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache and pain in the eyes are some of the symptoms of dengue. Doctors advise that those with these symptoms should seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and access to proper medical care can lower fatalities.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district. Since then, an increasing number of dengue infections, including major outbreaks, have been reported from many districts. At least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts in 2023.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Though the post-monsoon period is considered the dengue epidemic season, the deadly disease has already become endemic in Nepal, as outbreaks are reported every month, including in the winter months. \nEpidemiology and Disease Control Division (EDCD) under the Department of Health Services informed that one person died of dengue infection in Tanahun.2,365 people have been infected across the country since December last year. Dengue infection has spread to 73 districts. 537 people have been infected in Koshi Province, 46 in Madhes, 747 in Bagmati, 508 in Gandaki, 247 in Lumbini, 38 in Karnali and 242 in SudurPaschim.With the arrival of the monsoon, dengue cases have spiked in Kathmandu Valley.287 people have been infected in Kathmandu Valley, 137 in Kaski, 133 in Jhapa, 116 in Chitwan and 110 in Tanahun.Similarly, cases of cholera infections have been increasing. According to the EDCD, cholera has been confirmed in 30 people across the country with no casualties so far. \nAmid monsoon rains causing widespread death and destruction, the risk of infection of water- and vector-borne diseases intensifies.Officials at the Ministry of Health and Population are bracing for tough days ahead, as the escalating monsoon not only pollutes sources of drinking water but also provides breeding grounds for various disease-spreading vectors.“Over 2,000 people from 73 districts have already tested positive for the dengue virus and several districts have witnessed outbreaks of waterborne diseases, including cholera,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “We are aware of the possible risks and have alerted the relevant agencies.”The division said that 23 cholera cases have already been confirmed in Lalitpur, Kailali and Kathmandu districts. Likewise, as many as 2,061 people from 73 districts have tested positive for dengue. Health facilities across the country have been grappling with a surge in water- and vector-borne diseases. “Infection of the dengue virus has not risen this time compared to the previous years,” said Ghimire. “Ongoing rain has contaminated drinking water sources which increases the risk of potential outbreaks of waterborne diseases in the coming days.”According to data provided by the division, among the 73 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases at 249, followed by Jhapa 130, Chitwan 105, Tanahun 87, Makawanpur 78, Kaski 74, Bhojpur 62, Kavrepalanchok 60, and Okhaldhunga with 59 cases.Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika, according to the World Health Organisation.Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. Likewise, cholera is a highly infectious disease that causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting, which in turn results in dehydration and can lead to death within a few hours if left untreated. The World Health Organisation says cholera is a global threat to public health and an indicator of inequality and a lack of social development.Health officials said that the Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool samples of the infected patients. They concede that the outbreaks of the deadly disease are being reported only from the districts having active case surveillance programmes. Active cholera surveillance is being carried out from 27 health facilities in Kathmandu Valley and 10 in Kailali district.The monsoon season in Nepal is a time of epidemics during which thousands of people across the country become infected with waterborne and vector-borne diseases. Officials warned that health facilities could witness an uptick in the number of viral fever cases, and waterborne diseases—diarrhoea, dysentery, food poisoning, and snakebites—in the coming days.The Ministry of Health and Population last month urged provincial and local health authorities not to grant leave to health workers during the monsoon season and step up vigilance about the potential risks.Officials say that they have been raising awareness through all available means to inform people of the risks and directed agencies concerned to stockpile essential medicines.Doctors say the only ways to prevent deaths from waterborne diseases, including diarrhoea, are to raise awareness and ensure safe drinking water.They say a combination of careful surveys, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation and treatment are required to contain the spread of the diarrhoeal infection. \nAt least 20 diarrhoeal patients—12 from Lalitpur, eight from Kailali and two from Kathmandu—were found to have contracted cholera recently. People residing in other districts may have also been infected with the deadly disease, but due to absence of an active cholera surveillance programme in most of the districts, no one knows what is going on.“Active cholera surveillance is being carried out only in the three districts of the Valley—Kathmandu, Lalitpur and Bhaktapur—and in Kailali,” said Dr Hemanta Chandra Ojha, an official at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “We have a system in place in other districts as well but intensive surveillance is being carried out in Kathmandu Valley and in Kailali only.”Cholera is a highly infectious disease that causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting, which in turn results in dehydration and can lead to death within a few hours if left untreated. The World Health Organisation says cholera is a global threat to public health and an indicator of inequality and a lack of social development.Health officials said that the Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool samples of the infected patients. They concede that the outbreaks of the deadly disease are being reported from the districts having active case surveillance programmes. Active cholera surveillance is being carried out from 27 health facilities in the Valley and 10 in Kailali district.“Report of cholera outbreak in districts having intensive cholera surveillance is an obvious thing, as we carry out testing only when we find problems,” said an official at the Department of Health Services, asking not to be named as he is not authorised to talk to the media. “We will not know anything about the cause of disease outbreaks, if we stopped testing.”Officials at the Ministry of Health and Population, however, claimed that even if active cholera surveillance programmes are not in place in most of the districts, systems are in place to collect stool samples of the diarrhoeal patients and send them for lab testing if needed.“We have provincial public health laboratories in all provinces that can carry out cholera testing, and we also bring samples to the National Public Health Laboratory for examination when a massive diarrheal outbreak occurs,” said Ojha of the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “We have an Integrated Health Information Management System and Early Warning, Alert and Response System, which reports about the disease outbreaks. Active surveillance is being carried out only in high risk districts.”Officials, who wish not to be quoted in news as they fear retribution for speaking to the media, however, said that Integrated Health Information Management System only provides monthly reports; moreover, the system provides only clinical reports, not the reports of lab testing. The Early Warning, Alert and Response System is also not very effective.“The thing is systems on which health authorities rely much do not give an exact picture of the disease outbreak, and such systems do not help contain massive outbreaks,” the official said. “Major outbreaks of waterborne disease could happen at any time and at any place, and authorities concerned get alerted only after loss.”Health officials concede that it is not the government that is carrying out active surveillance of the deadly disease in four districts but the International Vaccine Institute, Korea. When asked why the government does not think it necessary to carry out active cholera surveillance in other districts, they said that the existing health budget is insufficient for the task.Cholera outbreaks during the monsoon season are not a new thing in Nepal, as hundreds of people throughout the country suffer from diarrhoeal infections that continue for months every year and scores contract the disease.In 2022, a total of 77 cholera cases were confirmed in the Valley. Last year, health authorities administered an oral cholera vaccine in Kathmandu Metropolitan City’s wards 11, 12, and 13, which were highly affected by the outbreak.Public health experts say that due to poor sanitation and hygiene conditions, the country as a whole is highly vulnerable to water-borne illnesses including diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid, hepatitis, and cholera, with thousands of people getting infected every year.They say sheer negligence from authorities concerned is responsible for ongoing outbreak of diarrhoeal diseases including the deadly cholera.Health authorities in most local units had stopped the testing of drinking water just before the start of the monsoon season, citing lack of funds, although deadly microbes such as faecal coliform and E coli were frequently detected in drinking water samples.Faecal coliform and E coli, both microscopic organisms, are found in human faeces. According to doctors, the presence of faecal coliform and E coli in drinking water means it is contaminated with sewage.Doctors say bottled water, which is widely used by households and offices in Kathmandu Valley, is generally considered safe, but water quality of several companies have been found questionable. Dangerous microbes are detected in bottled water every year, which means not all jar water brands are safe to drink without treatment.Doctors have asked authorities to launch awareness drives against water-borne diseases and ensure safe drinking water to prevent deaths from illnesses like cholera.To contain the spread of the infection, a combination of careful surveys, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation, and treatment is required, according to doctors.The World Health Organisation also said that a multifaceted approach is key to controlling cholera and reducing deaths. \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar. \nThe noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built. Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nNational Women’s Open Taekwondo Competition is set to take place from August 8.The fourth edition of the competition, organised by Nepal Taekwondo Association, will run until August 10 at Nepal Taekwondo Association’s central taekwondo hall in Satdobato, Lalitpur.The tournament will feature participants from all three departmental teams—Tribhuvan Army Club, Nepal Police Club and Nepal Armed Police Force Club, and seven provinces, according to the organisers.A total of 455 players will compete for 52 gold medals in the competition, which will see the martial artists contest in gyarogi and poomsae events. \nNepal national women’s volleyball team stormed into the final of the CAVA Women’s Volleyball Nations League after they defeated Iran in straight sets of 25-21, 28-26, 25-20 at the National Sports Council covered hall in Kathmandu on Tuesday.Up next for Nepal is a blockbuster final against their South Asian rivals India, which is scheduled for Wednesday.India beat Sri Lanka 25-15, 25-16, 25-23 earlier in the afternoon.The win also helped Nepal exact revenge on the Iranians who had defeated the hosts 25-16, 16-25, 25-23, 15-25, 15-13 in the group stage, with the loss costing Nepal a top-placed finish in the league.But, on Tuesday, Nepal were more disciplined and technically better although they had to survive a scare from Iran in the second set.Iran started the first set brightly taking a 5-1 lead but Nepal recovered to level the set 6-6 and never looked back, winning 25-21.The second set was a more thrilling contest.Nepal were ahead by 13-7 at one point but a lack of coordination and communication between the players soon left them reeling behind at 24-21. But Aruna Shahi’s team showed a significant revival to hold Iran to 24-24, with Usha Bhandari winning three points in a row. Iran earned the match points two more times but captain Shahi used her decade-long experience and wit before Niruta Thagunna capped off a brilliant Nepal comeback with a rock-solid spike.Having gained a 2-0 advantage, Nepal then won the third set, which also went neck-to-neck most of the time, to set up a mouth-watering final against India.It was also Nepal’s first ever victory over Iran in women’s volleyball.“It is a very happy moment for us,” said Nepal coach Jagadhish Bhatta during the presentation.“Iran are technically sound. But our players were more motivated. Nepal had committed several mistakes against Iran in the previous game (group stage). Today our team corrected them,” he added.“Obviously, our team made some mistakes against Iran (in the semi-final)…. but they were more cautious in the crucial moments.” Nepal will head into the final with full of confidence having beaten them 25-18, 12-25, 25-17, 18-25, 15-13 for a historic win.Bhatta was confident Nepal will repeat the feat again.“I believe in my team. I believe that Nepal will defeat India and win the trophy,” Bhatta added.Niruta Thagunna said Nepal will give their best in the final against India, once again.“We have already defeated India once in this tournament. But we still have weaknesses to work on. We are ready for India,” said Thagunna, who had been one of the most outstanding players this season. \nJuddha Shumsher's private zoo, built in 1932, housed various animals including elephants, horses, deer, monkeys, tigers, rhinoceroses, clouded leopards, red pandas, bears, palm civets, four-horned antelopes, Himalayan gorals, pheasants, Himalayan monals, a gharial crocodile, a porcupine, and even a lion.\nNepal's book market is plagued by unauthorized translations of popular international works by authors like Taslima Nasrin, Steve Jobs, and Robert Kiyosaki, despite copyright laws prohibiting such practices.\nBharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality’s ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via ‘tallo bato’—backdoor route—and that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal. \nParliaments, such as the UK and Nepal, oversee legislation through post-legislative scrutiny (PLS), ensuring laws meet their intended objectives and holding governments accountable.\nClimate change disproportionately affects vulnerable populations, highlighting the need for climate justice, as exemplified by Nepal's advocacy for international support and recognition of mountain-climate linkages.\nThe Gurung villagers, including some women, assaulted a Dalit man and his mother at their home in the Gurkha village of Lwang, Machhapuchhre Rural Municipality, Kaski, on Friday night. They also broke windows and shouted casteist slurs as well as demeaning remarks. The Dalit victims survived the unprovoked attack, but the single mother required treatment in intensive care at a hospital in Pokhara. Someone bravely took a video of the brutality on their mobile and uploaded it to a YouTube channel. That’s how the terrible crime came to public notice. I learnt from both the video reporting and community members that the local police have refused to register the case as an attempted murder motivated by caste hatred. The local authorities have bent on protecting the accused, their caste fellows, from legal action. This case shows how Dalits continue to suffer mental and physical violence at the hands of ethnic or tribal groups as well. Upper castes are generally blamed for committing crimes against Dalits, but it is not exclusive to them. I suggest that the incident can also be a window into the rather perplexing question of why ethnic groups like the Gurung, Magar, Rai and Limbu continue to segregate and dominate Dalits, even though their movements have vociferously denounced caste hierarchy and distanced themselves from Hindu customs and cultures for decades.Criminals of historyIn a recent Kathmandu gathering hosted by the newly established “Front for Identity” (opened two months ago under the leadership of Mahendra Lawoti, professor of political science at Western Michigan University, USA), Gopal Kirati, veteran leader of ethnic communities and former minister from the Maoist party, made an interesting self-reflexive remark. He said, “I’m a criminal of history. Growing up, I learnt nothing from this society and culture except how to treat Dalits worse than animals.” I wish more ethnic leaders and activists came forward like Kirati and acknowledged their and their communities’ ill-treatment of those considered lower or less pure than themselves. The fact that they continue to humiliate and attack Dalits even now should deeply concern them. It’s also time they realised their grave mistake of excluding Dalits from their movements, which peaked in the late 1990s and included them in their fight against Brahmanism. Dalits themselves recognise many differences between their issues and those of ethnic minorities; however, in reality, there are many overlaps. For one thing, in the eyes of the so-called high-caste Hindu, even ethnic minorities are low-caste Shudra; they, too, are denied the sacred thread and treated as untouchable. Upper castes, mainly orthodox Hindus, don’t accept rice prepared by members of ethnic communities. High castes wouldn’t normally marry ethnic minorities, and even if they did, the latter would face certain restrictions, mainly in the religious and spiritual sphere. An ethnic woman married to an upper caste may be barred from worshipping the lineage deities, for example.Not to mention, thanks to the extensive Hinduisation of ethnic groups over the years, there’s a degree of caste hierarchy practised within and amongst those communities as well. The Gurung wouldn’t marry a Tamang, for example, as the latter has been placed only slightly above the Dalit on the scale of ritual pollution. If the ethnic activists had brought Dalits on board—or at least forged a strong alliance with them—their movements would have become larger and stronger. In the meantime, their populace would probably have been educated about the fallacy and inhumanity associated with the Dalit exclusion. Members of ethnic communities would have learnt that the rejection of caste hierarchy also implies the termination of ritual hierarchy altogether. Thus, the behaviour of these ethnic groups towards Dalits would have hopefully changed quite drastically by now. Ethnic leaders and activists not only excluded Dalits from their movements but also didn’t talk about ending untouchability. They were keen on toppling the Bahun hegemony and separating and suppressing the Dalits. This has been a big failure of ethnic and indigenous identity politics so far. Proponents of ethnic identity should now see this drawback, as Gopal Kiranti seems to have done, and try to bring Dalits along with them. The Front for Identity, led by Prof Lawoti, appears keen to move in this direction. Identity: Horizontal versus vertical In a highly caste-ridden society like ours, the issues of collective identity and individual freedom seem conflicting. Ethnic politics does reify and solidify group boundaries. Ethnic groups are eager to highlight and bolster those inter-group boundaries, whereas Dalits want to dissolve those boundaries once and for all. How do we conceptually overcome this apparent mismatch?Notably, ethnic groups are horizontally arranged—long-term Hinduisation and caste-ification notwithstanding. They are culturally separate but, by and large, equal in status hierarchy. There’s much equality in how these groups interact with each other. Ethnic activists are keen to preserve and promote this horizontal separation.This doesn’t necessarily hurt Dalits’ quest for equality because they want to dismantle the vertical hierarchy and arrange themselves horizontally. They don’t want the statuses to be conceived as big and small, high and low, top and bottom, pure and impure. This explains why many Dalits hate the caste system while loving their caste identities. Dalit caste associations aren’t as big and influential as ethnic associations, yet they have been an important part of the Dalit movement for decades.Once people understand the difference between these two sets of identities arranged horizontally and vertically, the ethnic and Dalit movements can coalesce. This way, ethnic and Dalit campaigners can find common ground and struggle together. This should be the new way forward to accelerate societal change. The recent case of caste violence sheds light on the fact that caste discrimination is rampant within ethnic minority communities, too. They may resent the Hindu social hierarchy in terms of Bahun supremacy, but they are eager to continue suppressing Dalits. My past research and experience show that ethnic communities have played a big role in dominating Dalits, sometimes worse than upper castes! Things should change now, and activists from the new generation must be the active agents of that important change. If you really want to shake the social structure, don’t just fix the ones above you. Consider the plight of those below you. It’s basically the same principle and practice. If you want to challenge Brahmanic supremacy, get rid of your own supremacy as well. Charity begins at home, and so does change!  \nNepal's political instability leads to frequent changes in ambassadors (19 recently appointed), with negative consequences for the country's image and diplomacy, especially in international relations with India, China, and the US.\nNepal's major political parties, despite earlier alliances, have committed to contesting the 2027 general elections independently to test their popularity and adapt to informed electorate choices.\nTwo buses were swept away by the Trishuli River on July 12, highlighting the need for improved disaster preparedness and search and rescue capabilities in Nepal.\nUrban river encroachment and mismanagement have resulted in water pollution, degradation, and the threat of river loss, highlighting the need for a holistic approach incorporating natural and social science knowledge to protect rivers as vital arteries for life.\nWithin days of CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli and Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba reaching a deal to form a new government under Oli’s leadership, some Congress leaders including the two party general secretaries started doubting the deal’s implementation. Independent observers also have doubts over the longevity of the Congress-UML partnership. To get some insight, the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Congress Central Committee member Govind Raj Pokharel, who is also former vice-chair of National Planning Commission. Many have expressed doubt over the longevity of the Congress-UML alliance. What is your observation?There was a discussion in the political circles on the need for the Congress and the UML joining hands to address some serious problems the country has been facing for years. The issues of governance, flaws seen in the practice of the electoral system, and the national economy are some pressing issues that need to be addressed. In the meantime, the top leaders of the two largest parties reached a deal overnight. The dramatic turn of events made people suspect some unspoken reasons had brought the leaders of the two rival forces together. The leaders have stated that they joined hands mainly to review the constitution, to make changes in the electoral system, improve governance and address problems seen in the economic sector. These are the stated objectives. As far as my observation goes, people don’t have full faith in the leaders of the two parties because of past records. On the economic front, this coalition may achieve some improvements because both parties are on the same page. Both follow liberal economic ideas. Of late, even the UML has become increasingly liberal on economic issues. The private sector has welcomed the new alliance. There are already some signs of reforms. Their plan to make changes in the electoral system through constitutional amendment however is not easy. First, their numerical strength in the federal parliament, mainly in the upper house, is insufficient to amend the constitution. Such a move would be risky from a strategic perspective as well. Many groups and forces have reservations over various provisions of this constitution. Once they start the amendment process, it will be like opening Pandora’s Box. Thus I am optimistic only on the economic front. If they get that right, it will help address the society’s mass frustration.The two parties have cited the perennial political instability as a major reason behind their coming together. Can we now expect policy consistency as well?Political instability is an excuse to cover up their failures. Even the alliance of largest parties cannot guarantee political or policy stability. Numbers alone are not enough. Leaders also need to have a democratic culture and the capacity to manage emerging issues. Even governments led by a single party commanding up to two-thirds majority have failed. On certain occasions, coalition governments have done commendable jobs. Handling the post-quake situation and producing the constitution in 2015 were examples of big parties justifying their coalition. Thus even with some doubt, we can expect political stability and some economic reforms.The Congress unanimously endorsed the deal of party president Sher Bahadur Deuba and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli. But in public, leaders from the anti-establishment faction of the Congress don’t seem satisfied. Why this unease?The deal was made in a dramatic way without proper consultations with other leaders. At least those in the executive committees of the party should have been consulted. It is challenging for the Congress leaders to ally with their major rival, the UML. A cadre-based party, the UML’s style of governance is different to that of the Congress. When in government, the UML treats even government institutions, constitutional bodies and independent agencies as the party’s structures. Whereas the Congress allows more freedom to government agencies. So, there is a risk of the UML misusing state mechanisms while the Congress leaders are in the Cabinet. This is one big risk for the Congress. The second concern is the working style of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli. He is a towering personality, a hard-working leader, and with his strong command over his party organisation, he can swiftly implement any proposal. The Congress ministers who also have to listen to the concerns of the party’s top leaders may struggle to strike a balance. In Oli’s Cabinet, ministers are likely to get less freedom within their ministries. A rift is thus likely because of Prime Minister Oli’s working style.Why didn’t the Congress then send influential leaders to the Cabinet to check the prime minister?The leaders might not have been so interested in joining this government. They might have sensed intervention from the prime minister’s office and thought they might not be able to perform as per their expectation under Oli’s leadership. See, chiefs of the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre work in a dictatorial way. Once they are elected at the party convention for four years, they behave like dictators. They take decisions on their own without any consultations. People in Nepal often lobby for a directly-elected prime minister or President. I wonder what these leaders would do if they were directly elected as executive head. So, the problem is in the working style and attitude of our leaders, not in the constitution or the electoral system.Shekhar Koirala and Gagan Thapa had first pitched for joining hands with the UML to end ‘unnecessary bargaining’ of fringe parties. Suddenly, Deuba struck the deal with Oli. And, now Koirala and Thapa seem sceptical about the deal.The proposal of Koirala and Thapa was for Congress leading the government and the UML supporting it. In fact, Oli was ready to accept Congress leadership. He requested the Congress leaders to take the lead. Surprisingly, the negotiating team led by our party president reached an opposite deal. They offered government leadership to Oli.Then, could it be that, as some claim, Deuba and his wife Arzu were desperate to unseat Dahal fearing they could be dragged into corruption scams?I don’t know much about that scenario. But what I knew is that Oli was willing to join a Congress-led government.Why would Deuba, who is a very clever leader in making such give-and-take deals, have given up a chance to be prime minister right away?It’s true that all three party chiefs—Deuba, Oli and Dahal—are very clever in making deals in their own favour based on their numerical strength. A leader beats the other two on one occasion and on another, another of them comes out on top. It’s like a see-saw. This time Oli won the game.Congress General Secretaries Gagan Thapa and Bishwa Prakash Sharma have expressed suspicion over the implementation of the deal. Many say they did so as Deuba didn’t involve them in negotiations on power-sharing. Is it true?The party’s central work execution committee endorsed the deal signed by the two leaders. The leaders who participate in such meetings should speak up then and there if there is anything objectionable, instead of making such statements in public. Why didn’t they oppose it at the meeting? I don’t see any point in expressing doubt over the deal in public while endorsing the same in party committees.The two general secretaries also expressed doubt over Oli handing over government leadership to Deuba as per the agreement. Why this mistrust?The experience of the past two or three decades makes politicians suspicious of each other. Nepali politicians have hardly ever handed over government leadership easily. After four or five months of collaboration, some issues emerge and a rift is created. So, history makes us doubt that this coalition will last for three and half years. In the meantime, the party establishments have sidelined other factions when it comes to picking ministers, both at federal and provincial levels. When the government fails to perform as per expectation, party cadres of the ruling parties start criticising the government. Is it possible to amend the constitution as the two parties have announced?We can’t backtrack on the inclusive system. We must abide by the policy of inclusion in state agencies. The leaders who spoiled this system are saying that the proportional representation (PR) system is not working. But there is room to make our three-tier federal system more cost-effective. People get irritated when they see a large number of representatives benefitting from state coffers. We can bring down the number of local units from 753 to around 400. However, there should be sufficient wards as those units are directly involved in service delivery while the Palikas are more engaged in development activities. The number of ward members can also be decreased. In provinces, we don’t need PR seats as those elected from the provincial constituencies automatically represent the local communities. Likewise, the provincial cabinets can be downsized. Thus we can downsize the number of people who benefit from state coffers. This is vital to make the federal system sustainable. Similarly, we can rightsize the number of PR seats by adopting a rotational constituency for women, dalits and other marginalised communities. Only the candidates from underrepresented sections will compete in those constituencies. This will help elect competent people even from within the targeted communities. This is how we can address some concerns without compromising the inclusive system envisioned in the constitution.Why has the Congress picked gangsters and tainted individuals as ministers in provinces?The selection of such controversial individuals as ministers and policy makers will damage the party’s image. People are going to raise this issue seriously. In fact the pace of criminalisation and commercialisation of Nepali politics is faster than the political reform being undertaken to clean up politics.It seems intellectual leaders are being sidelined while gangsters are being promoted. Why is it happening?Because people from intellectual or political backgrounds voice critical views and leaders don’t like it. They speak what their conscience says is right. For instance, leaders like Mahesh Acharya and Minendra Rijal aren’t given any role in the party. It is a common problem in all the major political forces in Nepal.Is the space for leaders with intellectual backgrounds and having critical views being squeezed?The Congress used to be a very liberal organisation. But it has also become illiberal and leaders have become increasingly intolerant. All leaders—whether the seniors or young ones—are becoming less tolerant even of constructive criticism. Party leaders haven’t spoken against the selection of gangsters as ministers. Even the office bearers who are in decision making bodies and can change the decisions are silent now. This is dangerous. This is an example of how critical voices are sidelined.Haven’t the two young general secretaries been able to raise hope in the Congress?They are working like central committee members. General secretaries should be able to intervene while making crucial policy decisions. They can stop the party committees from making wrong decisions. But they are risk-averse. They are not taking the risk to fight the powerful party establishment.Historically, in all parties there is a trend of its anti-establishment faction bargaining for 40-45 percent seats in the party or government. If they don’t get an acceptable power sharing deal, they don’t cooperate with the party leadership. Is it a healthy democratic practice?Intra-party competition compels the leaders to do this. The ruthless establishment always sidelines party members and leaders if they aren’t loyal. So, the leadership of the anti-establishment has to protect such cadres because the rival factor too needs a strong support base of cadres to compete against the powerful establishment. Party establishments are strong due to centralised resources and other factors, so you need an equally strong force to compete against them. \nScores of people have been killed in landslides, floods and other monsoon-induced disasters within a month of the monsoon entering Nepal in the second week of June. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asks Jagadishwor Karmacharya, director general of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, what the department is doing to save people from disasters and whether our system is ready to cope with the challenges posed by climate change.Where is Nepal in terms of technology and expertise when it comes to forecasting the ever-changing weather patterns?If we compare to our situation a decade ago, we have made significant progress in setting up meteorological stations, collecting real-time data and increasing the frequency of weather predictions. We get rainfall data from around 350 stations, while we receive information about temperature and other related parameters from around 150 stations. We have an additional 175 centres to collect information about water levels. Our servers get real-time data every 10 minutes from all these stations. Besides that, we also have manual data collection centres. Thus, we have around 800 data collection centres in total. But we haven’t been able to set up enough stations in the Himalayan range due to difficult topography, low presence of government agencies and other factors. Also, we release radiosonde balloons to collect data on temperature, humidity and wind speed from the upper levels of the atmosphere. Overall, we have made huge strides in using technologies in the past decade, but it is still insufficient to cater to people’s expectations. They want specific weather information about their present location or destination. The expectation is valid. But our complex and diverse topography and meteorological phenomenon—ranging from the Tarai belt to the Himalayan range—makes accurate forecasts challenging. Kaski’s Lumle sees maximum rainfall in the country, and around 40 km north of it, the Jomsom area sees negligible rain. So great variability within a short distance adds to the challenge of forecasting.Do we have sufficient stations to cater to that variability?We need more stations because the higher you go, the more variabilities you find. In the plains, the weather pattern is more homogenous, while it is highly heterogeneous in the hills. In Tarai, even a station in around 100-150 kilometres may work because there is less variability of temperature as well as rainfall. But we need more stations in the hills where rain patterns drastically change.Are our methods and technologies being updated over time?Until around a decade ago, the forecasters used to predict based on their experience and the data received every three hours from the synoptic weather stations of Nepal and other neighbouring countries. At the time, we used to predict weather only for a day. Now, we synthesise the data collected from our systems and those from the modelling centres from India, China and other countries. Now, we can forecast for three days.Our capacity has significantly increased mainly in observing real time happenings. As I said, we take updates from hundreds of stations every 10 minutes. We also take satellite pictures from 16 channels of Japan’s Himawari Satellite, which has stationed its receiver in Nepal as well, also every 10 minutes. Until over a decade ago, we used to receive satellite pictures just once or twice a day. Even those pictures weren’t as good as those we get these days. We used to update surface-related data in three hours and upper air data in 12 hours. Based on that, we made a weather forecast for the next 12 hours. In comparison, we now have a large number of hydrological and meteorological real-time observation stations, the updates from Himawari and other satellites every 10 minutes and we have three radars to gather information. With the help of these technologies, now we can get immediate real-time updates. It helps us analyse the data of past hours and predict possible scenarios of the next six to 12 hours. We inform people accordingly. But we have to work more on the technology to make longer forecasts. Despite these progresses, we are still 15-20 years back in comparison to the technologies used by developed countries. We are behind in research. We need more expertise and an upgrade of our technology. Nepal doesn’t have its own satellite. Is this problematic?On the weather observation part, our work has not been hampered because we get data from the satellites of India, China and Japan. On the communication part, we are getting support from telecom companies—NTC and NCell—to transfer data. It covers most parts of the country. Absence of a satellite of our own is less of a concern compared to our other needs.Climate change has brought about massive changes in weather patterns. Do we have sufficient expertise to cope with this?The organisational structure and positions in our department haven’t changed much in over three decades. Demand for our work has drastically increased in the past two decades but we haven’t been able to cater to the demand. We need engineers capable of working with the latest technologies but we don’t have positions for such professionals in our current structure. We have procured some technologies and got some from our donors. But we don’t even have experts to use that as well.As you said, the department has made progress in the past decade but in this period climate change has progressed even faster. How do we keep up with this change?We face new challenges almost every year. In the past couple of years, mountain districts such as Manang and Mustang have not only witnessed rainfalls but also heavy downpours that even swept away bridges and other structures. Last year, over 30 hydropower projects were badly damaged by floods in eastern Nepal. The floods that wreaked havoc in Melamchi in 2021 were unprecedented. These incidents are evidence that climate change has already started to show unusual patterns and cause damages in this Himalayan range. We will face extreme weather patterns like long droughts and heavy rainfalls.The Dodhara weather station of Kanchanpur recorded 624mm of rainfall in 24 hours earlier this month. This is a new record. Before that, 540mm was the highest rainfall recorded, around two decades ago. Upward shifting of snowline in the mountains and formation of glacial lakes are other indications of the impacts of climate change. Don’t you think it’s already late to restructure government agencies, review policies and even redesign our systems?That is necessary. Devastation in Melamchi is one example that suggests the same. While developing such projects, we have to seriously consider possible impacts of climate change. Even if they analyse the possible scenario, they refer to the data of the past few decades. But things are changing so fast, decisions based on old data might not be useful. So, it is becoming more challenging to make projections. Design guidelines definitely need to be updated. Our division lacks policies, let alone updated ones. Though we are issuing red alerts and carrying out other tasks on scientific grounds, we don’t have a legal basis even to do these things.A large number of people in Nepal die in floods and landslides every year. Can we tweak our forecast system to save more lives?We have succeeded in reducing the deaths by floods in comparison to the loss we used to incur until 8-10 years ago. Earlier, we didn’t have flood alert service. It has been around a decade since we started the dedicated flood service. These days, we send mass SMS to the people of areas where floods may cause damage and for that we collaborate with telecoms—NTC and Ncell. We also work with district authorities and I/NGOs mainly in flood-prone districts to run campaigns and conduct drills. This has been quite effective. We are also taking similar initiatives in collaboration with telecom companies and other agencies to inform people on 13 various hydro-meteorological hazards such as, rains, lightning, winds.Working on floods is comparatively easier as it has certain catchment areas and we can focus on specific areas. So our efforts yield results. But in other incidents we can’t focus on certain areas. In floods, we inform the people hours before the flood so that they can shift to safe places. In the past, the death toll from floods used to be the highest. Now there are more deaths from landslides and lightning. We need to work more to give accurate information on lightning as well. Landslides vulnerability has increased due to extreme weather patterns, the impact of 2015 earthquake and rampant road construction.Why don’t people in Nepal follow and rely on weather forecasts? Is it due to negligence or lack of reliability of the prediction?It might be both. If the forecast doesn’t match reality, they may not follow or rely on us. So we need to improve our accuracy. Secondly, we need to increase awareness. Moreover, the weather isn’t as predictable as it used to be. So, we should keep on working, improving accuracy and making people aware. Many rely on international forecasts but not our own. Is our system less efficient?There are two aspects. One is getting accurate information and the second is user-friendly and attractive visual presentation of data, such as in mobile apps. We lag in the second part. Also, people want specific information about their locality and their intended destination. In the past, we used to give information by dividing the country in major regions such as eastern, central, western parts, tarai and hills. Now we have narrowed it down to each district. We need to work more on research.Have we succeeded in connecting weather forecasts to people’s livelihoods?The United Nations has launched the ‘Early Warning For All’ initiative to ensure that everyone on Earth is protected from hazardous weather, water, or climate events through life-saving early warning systems by the end of 2027. Various stakeholders need to join hands to implement it effectively as it has various components. Our expertise is to give as accurate information as we can. We give inputs but there are other agencies that go to the community level and work with the people.What are the things that need to be done in the changed context?We shouldn’t limit our work to simple forecasting but move to impact-based forecasts. For instance, we issue a seven-day Agromet Advisory Bulletin in collaboration with Nepal Agricultural Research Council which includes a summary on weather, crops, livestock, tables on weather and agrometeorological parameters, current weather information along with weather forecast (outlook). In a similar way, we can work with stakeholders on road transport as well. Then, we can make our forecast impactful, connect the general people and win their trust. But that requires proper policies and laws, updating this department’s organisational structure and enhancing the capacity of our human resource. \nThe July 1 midnight deal between the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, the first and the second largest parties in the federal lower house respectively, turned national politics on its head. Pushpa Kamal Dahal was thrown out as prime minister and KP Oli assumed the country’s leadership. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asked Maoist Centre leader Ram Karki, who has cultivated an image of a rebel within the party, on his reading of the event. How do you see the CPN-UML’s rebuffing of the CPN (Maoist Centre) and formation of a new government with the Nepali Congress?If you see it from the perspective of those who believe in parliamentary democracy, this is wrong. In the system, the largest party is believed to have the public mandate to run the government and the second-biggest to be the main opposition. A weak opposition makes for a weak parliamentary system. The system isn’t an ideal one for us [communists]. The two parties have made a mockery of the system they advocate for. Why didn’t the Maoist party that championed progressive agendas implement them when in government?We should admit that we lost the moral authority to implement and execute those agendas. We could have implemented those ideals by mobilising peasants, working-class groups, and people from oppressed communities, but our grip and connection with them have loosened.Why did the party and the leadership distance itself from the working class?The state has two arms—coercive and persuasive. The Maoists succeeded in using coercive force. But you can’t use this all the time. One has to use persuasive force most of the time. When we joined mainstream politics, we were the leading political force. We were in power. At the time we should have changed our education sector. For that, we should have worked on our curriculum and trained teachers. Our educational system is guided by patriarchal and feudal values. We need to orient people to questioning and following science. The party couldn’t do so. Had we done so, we would now have a critical mass with us. The Maoist leaders lost the moral ground. When you preach lofty ideas, the public won’t listen to you. They instead watch your lifestyle. Earlier, the Congress and the UML leaders, who were outsiders in Kathmandu, got ‘polluted’ when they worked in collusion with the capital’s elites. We, too, got ‘polluted’ by hobnobbing with the two parties. The working class and oppressed communities that had helped the Maoist party fight the state felt betrayed. The leaders and the masses are separated now. The Maoist party was the true leader of the progressive agenda such as inclusion, federalism, secularism and republicanism. These ideas are still valid, but the party failed to honour them. It failed because it lost its strength and disconnected itself from the class it fought for. It tried to become the leader of all people. The oppressed communities felt betrayal, while the other classes didn’t accept the party because of our past. Do you think the Congress and the UML will try to undermine progressive agendas enshrined in the new constitution?They have also sold lofty ideas to the people in the past. A counter-revolution under the two parties’ leadership is not easy. Their rank and file won’t accept it. The Congress, in fact, is not only a political party but a collective where you find radical Hindus as well as hardcore secularists. It stays strong as long as it works as a unified force of various groups. But when it imitates communists and tries to be a rigid cadre-based party, it loses its space and strength. So the Congress can’t lead a counter-revolution against progressive ideas. Counter-revolution is not easy, but the reactionary forces have certainly succeeded in regaining their space.Observers and politicians from rival parties claim that the Maoist Centre is now in an existential crisis. Do you think it can make a comeback?More importantly, the space that used to be occupied by the Maoist party is now left unoccupied.Can’t the UML or other forces make inroads into that space?The UML is a tried and tested force. Even the Maoist Centre is now described as a tested force. How can older forces enter that space? A force mightier than the Maoists can emerge. As a Maoist party member, I still vow to rejuvenate and revive the Maoist Centre. I am trying to convince my fellow comrades to do that. But my voice hasn’t prevailed. I have been presenting my papers in the party’s general conventions. We still have a strong belief that sooner or later, we will prevail because we are raising valid issues.Various leftist groups have at various times tried to create a strong, united left political force in Nepal. Do you think ideas like socialism and communism still attract the youth?Some rebel voices within our parties take some initiatives to raise our collective voice to build pressure on party establishments. But this has been limited to theoretical debates and failed to translate into politics. A theory or philosophy is like an iron plate, while crafting a tool from that iron is politics. We haven’t been able to transform our ideas into political action. If a leader floats a political agenda, the people first study the leader’s integrity. If a leader with a strong moral authority proposes an idea, people trust and follow it. If Gandhi was wearing a suit and telling people to wear handwoven khadi, Indian people wouldn’t have followed him. Similarly, if Mao was using clothes, watches and vehicles from developed countries while preaching for simplicity, Chinese people wouldn’t have followed him.Our people don’t listen to our leaders because they don’t see the leaders walk the talk. Youths are always attracted by adventurism; they are receptive and sensitive to certain incidents. Now, they aren’t following us because they don’t find any adventure and newness in our ideas. If we do some soul searching and correct ourselves, the Maoist Centre still can lead the process to complete the unfinished progressive agendas. Is that possible under the current Maoist leadership that has lost its credibility while staying in power for long? Will the people trust them?People will judge them based on their actions. If the Maoist leaders were more credible, there would be no space for the Congress and UML to come together. Either one or the other force would seek the Maoist party’s support. They wouldn’t have dared to ignore the Maoist party that led progressive issues in the recent past. They were emboldened because of the Maoists’ diminishing influence. Therefore, we have to correct ourselves in practice.You said that the classes and communities the Maoist party used to lead now have no leader. Can new outfits occupy that space?The traditional parties—the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre–don’t have any strategic vision on where they want to see the country in 20 years. The new forces are worse. They hit a ball and wherever it reaches, shift the goalpost there. They carry the goalpost with them. New forces with such visions can’t replace old parties. History shows that Nepal has witnessed political upheavals in a gap of 10-15 years. In the past such tsunamis have changed the political systems. Now we have seen sparks of movements but they are scattered. New forces need an ideological weapon. The Maoists forgot to sharpen their ideological weapon over time by holding ideological debates and upgrading themselves. Another is intra-party democracy. A political party that doesn’t practise intra-party democracy can’t enforce democracy in society.From the perspectives of intra-party democracy, the Maoist Centre is probably the most undemocratic of major political forces. Why?In the Congress, you are free to speak, but you don’t have a say in execution. Communist parties are too centralised. The structure conceptualised around a century ago in the context of wars and other contexts hasn’t been updated. Even new parties are run by the party chiefs imitating the anomalies of traditional forces. A leader is praised if s/he takes immediate decisions, gets them endorsed from the party committees and implements them swiftly. Those who say they have to first discuss the issue in party committees are described as weak. Such a trend is killing intra-party democracy.Do you think the Congress-UML coalition will succeed?A coalition between the parties that don’t even have a common minimum programme is a coalition of opportunists. They don’t have a moral ground either. On ideological grounds, the Congress still cites the late BP Koirala because no other leader of the party has worked on the theoretical front for decades. Such is also the situation with communists. They still cite the theoretical works of the late Pushpa Lal Shrestha. The current alliance is not a principled one, it’s a collaboration between opportunists. So, don’t expect anything better.How do you evaluate the outgoing government?It did nothing for the class it represents. The prime minister’s secretariat might have prepared a list of ‘100 important achievements of the government’. But what is the government’s priority? It failed to even give skills to those going abroad in search of work. They would have found better work had we given them valuable skills. Not only the outgoing one but all the previous governments have failed. The Congress-UML alliance has said it wants to review the constitution and amend the charter when necessary. How do you see this idea?This will be backtracking from the present constitutional roadmap. It is dishonest to create hindrance in implementing the federal system and then suggest the system is a burden. Such moves would give space to those who want to raise questions on republic and secular systems. There is a strong faction that lobbies for Hindutwa in the Nepali Congress. It is no secret that the Congress and the UML were not in favour of republic, secular and federal systems. But later, they rode the popular wave. But they have still not internalised it, and there are some regressive elements in both the parties but the people, who have come too far, won’t backtrack.Don’t you think the coming together of Congress and UML may ensure political stability?Instability is okay for me because stability may not necessarily be good for a country like ours. See, a single leader has been ruling a party continuously for over 30 years. What if they rule the country in a similar way? Look at some countries where a single leader has ruled for decades. The current arrangement is better than such stability.Will the Maoist party chairman and prime minister, who didn’t even appoint a minister from a Dalit community, have the moral authority to again champion the agenda of the oppressed?Appointing a minister is again an ornamental approach to appease certain communities. What we should do is ensure the participation of oppressed communities in policymaking.But party chair Dahal may again seek ways to get back to power. Will he pay attention to these issues?We should stop this chase for power at all cost. We will say this in our party meetings. We should accept the reality that we have just 32 seats and so we won’t get sufficient space to implement any important programmes even if we join the government.The way your party chief remained in power for over 18 months using various tactics, was it right?If you see it through a parliamentarian’s lens, it looks quite smart. If you see it through a Marxist perspective, just becoming a prime minister is futile if you can’t implement your policies and strengthen republicanism and participatory democracy. \nThe Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML last week reached an agreement to form a coalition government under the leadership of UML chair KP Sharma Oli. As a part of the package, they also aim to make certain changes to the constitution. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asked Pradeep Gyawali, deputy general secretary of UML, the reasons behind the coming together of the two largest parties, how they plan to run the government and to review and amend the constitution.Many are seeing the Congress-UML alliance as something unusual. What factors brought the two largest parties together even as there is no crisis-like situation or a special task such as constitution writing?Definitely, in normal parliamentary practice, the two largest parties don’t forge an alliance to run a government. The party that gets the biggest mandate leads the government, and the other big party remains in the opposition to make the ruling force accountable. In Nepal, the country’s two major forces, the Congress and the UML, have also joined hands in certain junctures for certain purposes. They worked together to make the constitution in 1990, to conduct general elections in 1999, to complete transition after the 2006 people’s movement and to bring out the constitution in 2015. We felt a need for a similar collaboration this time around. After the November 2022 elections, we saw three alliances in our parliament. At first, Maoist Centre chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal became prime minister with our support, but he failed to abide by the agreement sincerely. He changed the coalition within a month. The subsequent alliance between the Congress and the Maoist Centre lasted for a year. He again sought the UML’s support. Within four months of the March 4 deal with the UML, he started yet another gameplan to join hands with the Congress under the pretext of forming a national consensus government. It was quite unusual for the prime minister himself to instigate instability in the government. He publicly boasted that he had a ‘magical number’ [32 seats in the House of Representatives]. He thought that he could employ the tactic of ‘use and throw’ with the two largest parties and rule the country for the full term. He was completely indifferent to people’s plight, the country’s pressing issues and service delivery. This was the height of irresponsibility. So, the UML and Congress leaders concluded that the time had come to intervene to ensure political stability and service delivery and make sure public frustration doesn’t get out of hand. Did external factors play a role? Recent statements by UML leaders suggest that the party has taken it seriously. When national forces are weak, the neighbouring countries and international forces become more cautious, even more so given Nepal’s geo-political situation. Some of their concerns are valid. They fear political instability in Nepal may have an adverse impact on their genuine issues. We have to take this naturally. Second, it is no secret that we have a long legacy of facing external interference. Sometimes such interventions are carried out covertly and sometimes overtly. Therefore, national forces should be strong. Some political parties and leaders have a tendency of seeking external forces’ support to fulfil their vested interests. In return, they serve the external forces’ undue interests. Formation of a government is a purely domestic affair, but in our case sometimes it also becomes an issue of geopolitical interest. It is said that the UML was spooked when it learned that Prime Minister Dahal had reportedly approached the Congress for a new alliance. This reportedly happened after Dahal returned from New Delhi following Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s swearing-in.We were taken by surprise when the Congress leaders told us that the prime minister had reached out to them with a proposal to form a national consensus government. We were informed about the development from the leaders of the main opposition party. When we reached the March 4 deal with the prime minister, we thought he came to us with a commitment to course correction. Based on that, we supported him almost unconditionally. We didn’t bargain while sharing ministerial portfolios and didn’t talk about the prime minister’s term. We had even thought of allowing Dahal to run the government for the full term if the government functioned well and people were satisfied. We hadn’t even imagined that we would have to think about changing the coalition within four months.We definitely had certain grievances such as a lack of consultation with our party and our lawmakers while preparing the government’s policies and programmes and while allocating budget. Our party chair brought up this issue with the prime minister. But our concerns weren’t addressed. They had already started to ignore us. There were several issues with the prime minister, but we were committed to the partnership. But they had already gone too far. Fortunately, the Congress leaders didn’t accept the offer and instead raised critical questions about the rationale behind the proposal. Basically, the Congress didn’t trust Prachanda ji [Dahal] and came to us. It concluded that Dahal didn’t come with the intent of solving the country’s problems but to manoeuvre between the Congress and the UML.Besides jointly running the government, constitution amendment is another major aspect of the latest Congress-UML deal. What are the provisions the parties want to change?There are four major objectives of this agreement. Safeguarding national interest; strengthening economy; improving governance and service delivery; and ensuring political stability. A debate has started that some constitutional provisions are not helping maintain political stability. What we have said is that it’s been almost a decade since the promulgation of this constitution. Some of its provisions are yet to be implemented. On the other hand, provincial governments complain that they have not been able to work in a full-fledged way because the federal government has still not made some laws they need. So, first, we will undertake a comprehensive review on the progress in the course of implementing the constitution and the challenges we faced in the past decade, among other things. While doing so, we will find out if there are provisions that have posed challenges in maintaining political stability and running a stable government and suggest amendments accordingly.So, it’s not only about the amendment but also about review, assessment and recommendation for amendment, if there is a need. Even if the amendment process begins, it will be limited to ensuring political stability and won’t touch other aspects of the statute. There is no need to over-react. For instance, some Maoist leaders are trying to make it a political issue by describing it as a regressive move. That is wrong.So as per the two-party deal, the statute will be reviewed but not necessarily amended?Yes, whether to go for amendments will depend on the findings of the review. No constitution in the world is perfect. Its success largely depends on the practitioners. So, first we have to differentiate between the role of the constitution and the practitioners. It is true that our society is divided over certain provisions of our constitution. All these issues will be considered, but the fundamental features of the constitution such as democracy, inclusion and federalism won’t be altered. Our priority would be to only remove hindrances in making the system more functional, people-oriented and productive.Of late, people are debating the electoral system, provincial structure and secularism. Will these issues also be dealt with?Federalism is a new system for us. In fact, it is still an in-the-making process in Nepal. We have to note some timelines while analysing the performance of provinces. After the provincial and federal elections in 2017, the first provincial governments were formed in 2018, and they worked for around three years in a stable way. With small cabinets, they worked genuinely to strengthen the provincial system. At the time, most provincial cabinets had around six to seven ministers. They weren’t severely criticised at the time. The wrong trends in the provinces started with the division of the then Nepal Communist Party and the fall of the NCP-led governments at the centre as well as provinces. We saw the trend of horse-trading in provinces. Small parties made unjustified bargaining for ministerial portfolios, chief ministers started splitting ministries and increasing the number of ministers in their cabinets. Also, the November 2022 polls again gave a fragmented verdict, further augmenting the instability and anomalies at the provincial level. So, the problem is the way we are handling things more than the provincial structures. The time isn’t ripe to seek an alternative to the provinces. As far as the electoral model is concerned, we included proportional electoral (PR) system after long debates and discussions. Based on three general elections held after 1990, a conclusion was drawn that the first-past-the-post (FPTP) model couldn’t properly represent the historically under-represented sections. The premise is still valid. Based on the achievements, we may exclude certain communities from the list. But that time hasn’t come. Two questions raised over the use of PR are valid. Is the system really doing justice to the strata and class of the society for which it was introduced? This is the question not about the PR system but the leaders who use it. Similarly, some questions: Is proportional representation required in executive as well because representation is basically vital for policy making? The forms and modalities of the PR system might be discussed, but no one has even thought of removing the inclusive system.Similar is the case with secularism. The spirit is to make the state patron of all religions in the country. However, some sections of society have often tried to misuse and misinterpret the new constitutional provision. They try to interpret secularism as openly allowing rampant religious conversion, and some have made it an excuse to attack the age-old Sanatan faith. For instance, if the President or prime minister visits Lumbini, gurudwara or a shrine of any other faith on certain occasions, that is taken positively, but when they visit Pashupatinath Temple, a section of people raise questions. These activities have made some people think that these attacks on our Sanatan faith are taking place because of the secular system. There is no problem in the constitutional provision because the statute added an explanatory note that states, “‘secular’ means religious, cultural freedoms, including protection of religion and culture handed down from time immemorial.” But some extremist activities have given wrong impressions.Some experts believe the problem of fragmented mandate can be addressed by increasing the threshold required for a political party to be eligible to get PR seats, which can be done by amending laws. Will the Congress-UML alliance opt for this?Yes, this is one feasible option. I am in favour of this. As per the existing provision, a political party can secure seats under the PR category by securing 3 percent votes in the federal parliament and 1.5 percent votes in provincial assemblies. If a political organisation doesn’t even represent 5 or 7 or 10 percent of the population, what can they contribute to the country? You do politics to represent a sizable population and get a public mandate. Otherwise, the presence of such groups would only promote unreasonable bargaining and instigate instability in governments. This can be one of the agenda of the discussion between the two parties.This time, leaders have made it transparent that chiefs of the two parties will lead the government on a rotational basis. But why have other details of the agreement not been made public?There hasn’t been topic-wise discussions on specific provisions. The broader understanding is to review and assess the implementation aspect of the constitution and move ahead based on the findings of the assessment. We have also made it clear that such an act will be guided only by the objective of ensuring political stability and we will not go beyond that. Who will undertake this type of constitution review?We haven’t worked on it in detail. We haven’t reached any understanding. Naturally, inputs will be taken from the constitution makers, experts on constitutional law and politicians involved in this field. But no decision has been made on its nitty-gritty.The Rastriya Prajatantra Party that wants to revive the Hindu kingdom was the first party to welcome the Congress-UML deal while the Maoist Centre has accused Congress and UML of making a regressive move. So don’t you think this affair is tricky?I don’t think the political parties will touch the issues that the RPP talks about, such as reinstatement of Hindu kingdom and dissolution of federalism. No one is thinking about that. Also, the questions raised by the Maoist leaders have no meaning. They are only trying to make a political agenda.It also seems that the Congress and the UML floated this idea of reviewing the constitution to make a case for the two largest parties to form the government.That’s not true. This question undermines the spirit of this agreement. If this system fails, people will raise questions mainly to the leaders of the Congress and the UML, not Prachanda. It’s not only about running the government. We were already in the government and it isn’t a big deal for the Congress to return to power. If democracy fails, the democratic forces will lose the most. So we are genuinely working on this. The Congress and the UML are historical rival forces in Nepali politics. How can the two work together in government?It is true that the Congress and the UML are the two major competitors of this country. But we have some converging factors. First, we both believe in a broader democratic framework. Sometimes, the Congress may give more emphasis on liberal values while we may push for more socialism-oriented programmes. But the common ground is democratic values. We also have the experience of successfully carrying out certain tasks jointly. We may have some friction but we also have experience of managing bitter intra-party fighting as well as inter-party rivalry.How will the ministerial portfolios be shared in the new coalition?We haven’t reached any agreement in detail. As we aim to make this a ‘national consensus government’ we are in favour of accommodating other parties. So it will depend on the number of parties that join the Cabinet. Our only concern is that ministerial allocations should be done in a way that doesn’t weaken the prime minister in order to ensure that the head of the government can deliver.How can a government without the Maoist Centre and some other parties be called a consensus government?We have to wait for that. Leaders of political parties that fiercely criticise the government also join the Cabinet under one or other pretext. Some political parties seemingly cannot exist without being in the government.  \nThe Meteorological Forecasting Division forecast the weather across the country to be generally cloudy on Wednesday.Light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is expected at many places in Koshi, Bagmati, Gandaki, Lumbini, Karnali, and Sudurpaschim provinces, with a few areas in the rest of the country also experiencing similar conditions. There are chances of heavy rainfall in a few locations within Koshi, Bagmati, Gandaki, Lumbini, Karnali, and Sudurpaschim provinces, with very heavy to extremely heavy rainfall predicted in some areas of Koshi and Sudurpaschim provinces, and in one or two places in Lumbini and Karnali provinces.Tonight, the skies will be partly to generally cloudy.

The monsoon trough is situated to the north of its average position.On Tuesday, the highest maximum temperature recorded was 34.2°C in Dhangadhi, while the lowest minimum temperature was 16°C in Jomsom. Dharan received the highest rainfall of 104.1 mm in the past 24 hours. \nOn Tuesday, the weather will be generally cloudy across the country, with light to moderate rain accompanied by thunder and lightning expected in many areas of all provinces. The Meteorological Forecasting Division said there is a possibility of heavy rainfall at one or two locations in the Koshi, Madhesh, Bagmati, Gandaki, Lumbini, and Sudurpaschim provinces.Additionally, heavy to very heavy rainfall may occur at one or two spots in Koshi, Bagmati, Gandaki, and Lumbini provinces.Tonight, cloudy conditions will persist nationwide, with light to moderate rain and thunderstorms anticipated in many areas across all provinces. Heavy to very heavy rainfall may affect a few locations in the remaining provinces, while very heavy to extremely heavy rainfall is possible at one or two sites in Bagmati, Gandaki, and Lumbini provinces.Meteorological analysis indicates that monsoon winds are affecting the country, with the monsoon trough positioned to the north of the average location.On Tuesday, the highest temperature recorded was 38.4 degrees Celsius in Janakpur, while the lowest temperature was 15 degrees Celsius in Jomsom.In terms of rainfall, Ghorahi received the highest amount at 53.6 mm, followed by Dadeldhura with 30.1 mm. Other notable rainfall figures include Pokhara with 10.3 mm and Jiri with 8.6 mm. Some areas, such as Dipayal, Birendranagar, and Simara, reported no rainfall during this period. \nThe Meteorological Forecasting Division under the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology has issued a ‘heavy to very heavy’ rainfall warning for Tuesday and Wednesday.Issuing a ‘monsoon special bulletin’ on Monday morning, the Met Office said that the monsoon trough is positioned north of the average place in the east and south of the average place in the west, and this unusual positioning could lead to more intense rain. The monsoon trough is a low-pressure area that brings moisture-laden winds from the oceans and causes increased cloudiness and rains.“There is a chance of heavy to very heavy rainfall in some places of Koshi, Bagmati, Gandaki, Lumbini, and Sudurpaschim provinces and a few places of Karnali and Madhesh provinces,” reads the bulletin issued by the Met Office. “There is also a chance of extremely heavy rainfall in one or two places of Bagmati, Gandaki, and Lumbini provinces.”The Met Office warned of the risk of landslides, debris flow, and land erosion in the hills and risks of floods and inundation in urban areas and in the Tarai. Water levels in small and big rivers could rise, and daily life, agriculture, health, tourism, and land and air transportation could also be affected, according to the bulletin. The Met Office has asked the general public and all relevant agencies for precautions.This is the sixth special bulletin issued by the Met Office since the start of the monsoon on June 10.The monsoon season in Nepal generally begins on June 13 and ends on September 23. This year, the monsoon entered Nepal from the southwest on June 10, three days ahead of the usual onset date. Last year, it started on June 14, a day later than normal.This year, the division has forecast above-normal rains and above-average maximum and minimum temperatures this monsoon, which could unleash extreme weather events such as flooding, inundation, and landslides.Several districts have already reported incidents of landslides, flooding and lightning since the start of the monsoon season.According to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority, at least 150 people have died, and scores have been injured and missing in landslides, flood and lightning-related incidents since June 10.What do red, orange and yellow warnings signify?Red warning: According to Met officials, a red warning means looming extreme weather conditions. Excessive rainfall, floods, landslides, inundation, and others are likely to cause widespread damage. For the general public, it is a message to keep themselves and others safe from the extreme weather consequences and not to travel in risky zones. “Along with the general public, this is also an alert to all agencies concerned to gear up for response,” said Raju Pradhananga, a senior meteorologist.Red alerts have been issued for the districts of Taplejung, Panchthar, Sankhuwasabha, and Terhathum in the Koshi province; and Rasuwa, Chitwan, Nuwakot, Dhading, Sindhupalchok, and Dolakha in the Bagmati province. Likewise, Myagdi, Kaski, Baglung, Parbat, Syangja, Tanahun, Nawalparasi-East, Lamjung and Gorkha districts of the Gandaki province are also in the red zone. Similarly, red alerts have been issued for Kapilvastu, Rupandehi, Palpa, Gulmi, Nawalparasi-West, Dang, Banke, Bardia, Gulmi, Arghakhanchi of Lumbini province, as well as Kailali, Kanchanpur, Dadeldhura, Doti and Baitadi of the Sudurpaschim province.Orange warning: An orange warning also means moderate risks. Experts say severe situations due to extreme weather events are very likely in the said districts. For the general public, it is a message to make preparatory plans for potential emergencies. As the probability of extreme weather events is high, it is also a request not to travel in risky zones—landslide-prone roads and riverbanks, among others. According to Pradhananga, it is also a request to people to protect themselves and family members.The orange warning has been issued for the Okhaldhunga, Jhapa and Morang districts of the Koshi province; Siraha, Saptari and Dhanusha of Madhesh, and Ramechhap, Kathmandu and Bhaktapur of Bagmati. Orange warning has been also issued in Manang of the Gandaki province; Rukum-East and Rolpa of Lumbini, Dailekh, Surkhet, Salyan, Rukum-West, Jajarkot and Kalikot of the Karnali province; and Darchula and Achham of the Sudurpaschim province.Yellow warning: A yellow warning signifies serious consequences from extreme weather events, but its chances are very low. The bad weather conditions could disrupt daily lives. The yellow warning has been issued in Mustang, Dolpa, Mugu, Humla, Jumla, Bajura and Bajhang districts. \nToday, Nepal is expected to experience partly to generally cloudy conditions. Light to moderate rain, accompanied by thunder and lightning, is likely across all provinces, with a chance of heavy rainfall in one or two locations in Koshi and Bagmati provinces.Tonight, cloudy conditions will persist throughout the country. Light to moderate rain, with thunder and lightning, is anticipated in many areas of Koshi, Madhesh, Bagmati, Gandaki, and Lumbini provinces, and in some parts of the remaining regions.Heavy rainfall is possible in a few places in Koshi, Madhesh, and Bagmati provinces, and at one or two locations in Gandaki and Lumbini provinces. There is also a risk of very heavy rainfall at one or two places in Koshi and Bagmati provinces.On Sunday, the highest recorded temperature was 35.2 degrees Celsius in Dipayal and Dhangadhi, while the lowest recorded temperature was 14.5 degrees Celsius in Jomsom.  \n\nBe elaborative as possible.

Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nAll five people on board an Air Dynasty helicopter were killed when it crashed on a hillside located some 11 kilometres northwest of Kathmandu on Wednesday. The accident comes just two weeks after the Saurya Airlines crash in Kathmandu that killed 18 people.This is the fifth helicopter crash in Nepal in two years. At least 41 crashes involving helicopters have been recorded across the country since 1979, including 20 fatal ones.On Wednesday, the air traffic controller gave a go-ahead for a 9N-AJD chopper belonging to Air Dynasty to fly from Kathmandu to Syaprubesi, Rasuwa, on the country’s northern border, with four Chinese nationals on board.An on-duty air traffic controller said the chopper lost contact with the Kathmandu tower two minutes after takeoff at 1:54 pm. “The weather was perfect. There was sunshine and no haze at Kathmandu’s airport.”“We were informed about two trips.”Bal Krishna Pandit, safety manager of Air Dynasty, said the flight was scheduled to take four Chinese nationals to the north, from where they would cross the border to their country. “On the return flight, the chopper would bring from Syapru five Americans who had reached there after the Kailash-Mansarovar pilgrimage tour in Tibet.” “We don’t know the exact reason behind the crash, but an initial report shows a weather problem in the Shivapuri hills, even though it was clear in Kathmandu,” said Pandit. The chopper may have encountered an abrupt change in weather and entered a fast-moving fog. It then hit a small hill and crashed into the jungle.Post photojournalist Angad Dhakal, who reached the crash site after an hour, said the area was blanketed by a thick fog. According to him, the locals reported a “big bang” inside the bushes.“The scene was horrific. Police were searching for missing body parts scattered over 50 metres.”The chopper had been totally burnt, except for the tail.DIG Dan Bahadur Karki, spokesperson for Nepal Police, said the bodies of four men and a woman were pulled from the wreckage. The chopper was flown by Captain Arun Malla, who also died.The crash site is in Suryachaur of Nuwakot district.Air Dynasty Heli Service is one of the oldest helicopter rescue companies in Nepal. It was founded in 1993 by Ang Tshering Sherpa, the owner of Yeti Group, who also died in an Air Dynasty helicopter crash in Pathibhara, Taplejung, in 2019. Along with him were tourism and civil aviation minister Rabindra Adhikari and a few top officials of the civil aviation body. In the past two years, there have been eight crashes—six fatal. On May 29 2022, a Tara Air plane carrying 22 people crashed on its way to Jomsom from Pokhara, killing 22 on board. On January 15, 2023, a Yeti Airlines plane crashed in Pokhara, killing 72 aboard. On July 11 last year, a Manang Air chopper crashed near Lamjura in Solukhumbu district, killing everyone aboard, including five Mexican tourists and a Nepali pilot.On October 14, a helicopter of Manang Air flying towards Solukhumbhu came down in Lobuche. Captain Prakash Kumar Sedhai, who was injured in the crash, died while undergoing treatment in India. On July 24, a Saurya Airlines plane crashed at the Tribhuvan International Airport, killing 18 people. At least 124 people have died in air crashes in the past two years, which suggests that air safety in Nepal has truly gone for a toss.“It’s unfortunate, again. Unless we focus on strengthening the Safety Oversight system, these kinds of accidents will continue to happen,” said Rajan Pokhrel, former director general of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal. “The prerequisite to strengthening safety oversight is establishing a dedicated aviation regulator, which the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal is not.” Wednesday’s crash is the eighth under Pradip Adhikari, the director general of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, and the fifth fatal one of his tenure.On Sunday, Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba and a group of party lawmakers met Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli to discuss domestic air safety.“The meeting was focused on tabling the civil aviation bills, which aim to split the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal into two entities: a service provider and a regulator,” said Rajendra Bajgain, one of the lawmakers.“The way people are being killed due to regulatory failures amounts to a heinous crime,” he said. The lawmakers have been demanding that Adhikari be sacked, for allegedly stopping the passage of the bills and for the lack of efforts to make Nepali skies safe.“A man has eight crashes under his belt. And yet, the government is not serious about his performance. The series of crashes has caused a big dent in Nepali tourism’s global image,” said Bajgain.In 2014, Spanish consultancy INECO prepared the first draft of the proposed legislation with $4.2 million in funding from the Asian Development Bank. The process had received the approval from the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal board in 2010.Since then, several drafts have been prepared and discarded. The draft of the bills prepared by a consulting firm of former law secretary Raju Man Singh Malla and reviewed by the Tourism Ministry was registered in the National Assembly on February 23, 2020, after the go-ahead by the KP Sharma Oli-led Cabinet at that time.The two pieces of legislation—the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal Bill and the Air Service Authority of Nepal Bill—were unanimously passed by the National Assembly on August 2, 2021.Since then, the bills’ tabling in the lower house has been blocked.“Now, the bills are back in the Oli Cabinet. It is the incumbent prime minister’s moral duty to table the bills that the upper house has already approved. It is the fastest way to break up the civil aviation body—and to make the Nepali skies safer,” said Pokhrel. \nThe top leaders of the three major parties have unanimously agreed to endorse the bill to amend the Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act at the ongoing session of the federal parliament.On Wednesday, receiving the report of the three-member taskforce formed to build consensus on the contentious issues of the bill, they claimed the country is now headed towards concluding the transitional justice process—the last leg of the peace process that began with the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Accord on November 21, 2006.The chiefs of the three prominent parties had on July 1 formed the taskforce comprised of Ramesh Lekhak of the Nepali Congress, Mahesh Bartaula of the CPN-UML and Janardan Sharma of the CPN (Maoist Centre) after the Law, Justice and Human Rights Committee of the House of Representatives failed to iron out differences mainly over four provisions in the bill.It took a month and six sittings for the Lekhak-led panel to build consensus. The report was submitted jointly to Prime Minister and UML chair KP Sharma Oli, Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba and CPN (Maoist Centre) Chairperson Pushpa Kamal Dahal. “The agreement has been reached taking the Supreme Court’s verdict, international standards and a victim-centric approach into consideration. This is a milestone in concluding the remaining task of the peace process,” said Oli after receiving the report. “Now there is no confusion and dilemma over completing the pending tasks of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons.”The process of appointing office bearers to the commissions would follow the bill’s parliamentary endorsement. Oli said the amendment bill will be tabled in the federal parliament, ensuring that it gets through the ongoing session. Also receiving the report, Dahal said the agreement is a significant achievement of the present government. “I would like to request the government to present the bill in the full House and get it endorsed,” said Dahal. “When the political agreement transforms into law, it will lead to a long-term solution to conflict-related issues through relief and reparation, among other measures.” The top leadership has claimed Nepal will set an example for the world by concluding the transitional justice process. “I appreciate the efforts made by our friends in finding a consensus on the bill. Nepal will present an example to the world if it manages to conclude the transitional justice process,” said Deuba.As per the written agreement made public on Wednesday, the taskforce has agreed to list rape or serious cases of sexual violence, intentional or arbitary killing, enforced disappearances and inhumane or cruel torture as serious violations of human rights thus non-amnestiable. Rest of the incidents fall as human rights violations and are amnestiable.The three parties have also agreed to include a provision which says that in cases other than serious violations of human rights, there can be reconciliation (between the victim and the perpetrator). According to another point of agreement, the attorney general cannot be forced to press ahead with a legal case in cases of human rights violations or serious violations of human rights where there has been reconciliation or a recommendation for amnesty. The taskforce also agreed to reduce sentencing by up to 75 percent except in cases of rape or serious sexual violence. It has set different yardsticks to do so. Decisions on reduced penalty can be taken after examining whether the perpetrators provide information on the allegations against them, whether they cooperate with the commissions on evidence collection and whether they express remorse for their acts. Similarly, before recommending a reduction in penalty, the commissions need to evaluate whether the perpetrators have apologised to the victims and made commitments not to repeat such acts. All disqualified Maoist combatants including child soldiers, along with the families of security personnel who died or got injured during the insurgency, will get reparation and compensation, as per the agreement. However, the issue of child soldiers, which is considered a war crime, along with crimes against humanity and other acts of war crime find no mention in the agreement. Based on the three-party agreement, the committee will endorse the bill and forward it to the House of Representatives. The bill must be endorsed by both chambers of the federal parliament to come into effect. There will be no obstacle for the bill’s endorsement as the three parties hold more than two thirds of seats in Parliament. \nThe Nepali Congress Central Working Committee examined and amended party reports, including proposals to contest future elections independently and address issues related to the Maoist insurgency and the safety of Nepali citizens abroad.\nNepal's women's volleyball team lost 3-2 to India in the final of the CAVA Nations League, falling short of their first international trophy; despite a strong start and a group stage victory over India, Nepal was unable to overcome India's comeback in the fifth set.\nFive Nepali remains from Russia-Ukraine war handed over to families, with details of deceased and ongoing status of other Nepali nationals involved in the conflict.\nNepal and Oman establish comprehensive cooperation framework, including high-level visits, trade, investment, and people-to-people engagement.\nNepali Embassy in Abu Dhabi warns Nepali residents in UAE to avoid alcohol-fueled misconduct, as reported incidents have prompted police action.\nThe Supreme Court has ordered the government not to implement the decision to remove Kapil Acharya and Bhakta Bahadur Pun from the post of the board of directors of Nepal Electricity Authority until the next order.Hearing on the writ petition filed by Acharya and Pun, a single bench of Justice Sunil Kumar Pokharel on Thursday ordered the authorities not to implement the ministerial-level decision to remove the petitioners from their positions.They had mentioned the Office of the Prime Ministers and Council of Ministers; Minister for Energy, Water Resources and Irrigation Dipak Khadka; Nepal Electricity Authority; and newly appointed directors Devendra Karki and Mahendra Bahadur Gurung as defendants in the case.Minister Khadka appointed Karki and Gurung in the two posts that went vacant after the removal of Pun and Acharya on August 2. Karki and Gurung were also appointed on the same day.Earlier, Acharya and Pun were asked for written clarification on July 30 as they took a firm stance that the industries that didn’t pay the outstanding dues for using the electricity facility through dedicated and trunk lines should be cut and not be connected until they paid the dues.Minister Khadka relieved both of them the day they submitted their clarification citing that their answers were inadequate and not satisfactory.They firmly stood against resuming electricity supply to the industries in spite of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s assurance to the industrialists that the public utility would resume the power supply to the industries despite the dues they owe to it.The energy authority had cut off the power supply to Reliance Spinning Mills, Ghorahi Cement, Arghakhanchi Cement, Jagdamba Steel, Jagdamba Synthetics and Hulas Steel since July 9 for not clearing the due.After constant pressure from Prime Minister Oli and the decision of the NEA Board, the power was resumed to the industries from July 24. \nThe taskforce of the three major political parties—the Nepali Congress, the CPN-UML and the Maoist Centre—formed to find meeting points on the contentious provisions of the bill to amend the transitional justice-related law has submitted its report to the chiefs of three parties. The points of the agreement forged by the three-member panel were informally made public last week. Again, most notably, on Wednesday the chiefs of all three parties jointly accepted the report and unequivocally committed to resolving the remaining task of the peace process. After getting the report, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli vowed to expedite the bill and endorse it from Parliament without any further ado and then to swiftly implement it. In the prime minister’s words, this time, the amendment to the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act would be meaningful and the ‘remnants of the conflict’ will be dealt with once and for all. Chairman of the CPN (Maoist Centre) Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who led the decade-long Maoist insurgency, and Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, sounded as committed to finding closure. Much optimism based just on Nepali leaders’ words may not be warranted. But, at times, important political achievements have been possible when leaders of these three parties have joined hands. Signing of the Comprehensive Peace Accord in 2006, management of arms and army of the Maoist party, constitution promulgation in 2015, among other knotty issues related to the peace process, took place based on such understanding among these forces. A major but crucial task that remains pending is delivery of justice to the victims, as envisioned in the CPA all those years ago. Of the three parties, Dahal of the Maoist Centre and Nepali Congress’ Deuba often felt put under pressure to swiftly conclude the peace process, as these parties were directly engaged in the insurgency from opposite sides—much more than the UML. In the past when Deuba and Dahal tried to push the process, UML leaders appeared intent on hindering its progress, sometimes out of conviction and sometimes for purely political reasons. With Prime Minister Oli keen to conclude the process at a time of his government leadership, and Deuba and Dahal ready to capitalise on the rare opportunity, there could perhaps be no better time to take the peace process to its conclusion. That said, the agreement among the leaders of the three parties is not sufficient. They must not forget that all they are doing is ultimately aimed at the victims. If the victims feel they are not getting justice, completing the process would be meaningless. Many have found the provisions proposed by the three-member panel largely progressive and fair, but a section of victims are still dissatisfied with a few conditions. We urge the major politicians to strive to address the concerns of these holdout victims while giving final touches to the amendment bill. Trying to ram the bill through Parliament without such effort would be ill-advised. Addressing the concerns raised by the Supreme Court in its past decisions and winning the trust of the international community is as important. On the other hand, those advocating on the victims’ behalf would also do well not to seek a perfect solution to what is an inherently complex problem.  \nNepali politics has been polarised in a new fashion, particularly after the July 1 deal between the two largest parties to form a governing coalition.While the CPN-UML and the Nepali Congress, with most seats in the House of Representatives, teamed up to edge the Maoists out of the government, the pretext given was to tide the country over its “unprecedented crisis of public confidence in the government” and a “historic low of hope in the general people”.The opposition bloc led by preceding prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal of the Maoist Centre, with the Rabi Lamichhane-led Rastriya Swatantra Party and Madhav Nepal’s Unified Socialist by his side, counters the narrative that the two parties joined forces to pull the country from the brink. Voices on the opposition benches are that old foxes of Nepali politics were ruffled by the Dahal government’s sparing none in corruption cases policy, even those working closely with top politicians.What’s questionable are intentions, not issues. No informed citizen denies today that the country faces humongous challenges. For good or bad, nearly 4,000 Nepalis leave the country daily; those who return are far fewer. The country’s farm and industrial outputs are way short of its domestic requirements. There’s a gloom in the jobs sector and wages are stagnant, even falling.The constitutional dynamiteNepal’s new constitution will mark a decade next year. Feared to fail from its inception, it still cries for full ownership at home and the goodwill of the country’s all-dominant southern neighbour. The Congress and the UML are blaming it, rather than their own waning popularity, for the country’s federal and provincial legislatures, where no single party currently has a majority and government changes have been too frequent.Tampering with the constitution may be akin to opening Pandora’s box. After years-long negotiations, the three major parties had hastily sealed it in 2015.There are several misgivings about the new political order. The Hindu hardliners aren’t happy with the secular state. The ethnic groups or janajatis aren’t satisfied with how most of the provinces were carved out or named. Women need more equality in terms of representation. The provinces want more autonomy. However, the clamour for charter revision is only about the Congress and the UML maintaining their old hegemony. The rise of new forces threatens them, and they want to tame the tendencies of adventurist politicians like Maoist supremo Dahal or stub out the quest for power in Madhav Nepal by denying them opportunities to regroup or forge electoral alliances.A blamed factor in the current state of hung parliament is the low threshold for parties to claim their proportional representation seats. A slight rise from the current 3 percent of total valid votes would reduce the number of national parties by at least two, giving their proportional seats to the bigger forces. While the most prominent parties’ frustration at being undercut by smaller forces at the elections is visible, getting the constitutional amendments through is not easy.A clash of titansSharing of power between the two competing parties is fraught with problems. As the developments so far suggest, there are dissatisfied aspirants aplenty, particularly in Congress, despite the swift formation of the Cabinet under Oli. What looks more complicated is installing new provincial governments as the existing ones have toppled after the change of the ruling coalition in Kathmandu. In the provinces, which are in the eye of an anti-federal storm that’s brewing in the marginalised communities and among Hindu hardliners, chief ministers are already facing problems with shaping their Cabinet. Ministerial positions are reportedly falling short in Gandaki as the number of hopefuls is too high. Splitting ministries to appoint more ministers gives rise to mass frustration that politicians are trying to steal public finances.This KP Sharma Oli government is based on a seven-point agreement between the two parties. Under the deal, the UML leader will remain prime minister for the first two years. Oli will then hand over the reins to Sher Bahadur Deuba of the Congress, who will steer the government until a new parliament is elected. That’s subject to things staying their course, though. In the unpredictable politics of today’s Nepal, what’s not agreed to often happens.Politicians well acquainted with Oli do not see smooth sailing for both the UML and the Congress. One such doubter is RK Mainali, one of Oli’s jail mates from the repressive Panchayat regime. The Congress and the UML are historical arch-rivals, who have used every opportunity to check on each other in power and elections. In the most recent exercise, each has used the Maoist Centre as a coalition partner or an electoral ally to defeat the rival party. Mainali argues that if the Supreme Court rules in favour of Oli in the case of constitutionality of the government formation process, he will, in due course, make the UML the largest party by taking in smaller leftist forces. If the court ousts Oli, ruling that the government should have been formed under Article 76(3) of the constitution, rather than Article 76(2) through which Oli came in, Deuba will be appointed the prime minister as the leader of the single largest party. This could set in motion the downfall of Nepal’s fragmented communist front.Bay of Bengal climateThere’s a big churn in the political climate surrounding the Bay of Bengal nations. First with the Sri Lankan uprising in 2022, then the regime changes in the Maldives late last year and Imran Khan’s political purge in Pakistan early this year, a popular storm in Bangladesh rooted Sheikh Hasina out of power on Monday and threw her into exile. Early cautions from the events unfolding in the country 27 kilometres away from Nepal suggest that rulers in the neighbourhood should brace for potential repercussions at home. It’d be undesirable for the government in Kathmandu to inflame the public in any way at a time of desperation, starting right from the 2020 pandemic and the cost of living crisis worsened by Russia’s ongoing Ukraine war and the escalating conflict in West Asia.One such trigger in Nepal could be haphazard tampering of the constitution while the dust over its chaotic promulgation nine years ago has barely settled. We should not forget that the protests in the east over the province’s name ‘Koshi' have only been lulled by the summer heat and monsoon rains. Also, as the Bangladeshi situation has shown, not allowing big or small forces in peaceful politics can have deadly consequences. In Nepal, too, the Congress and the UML have floated a self-appeasing idea that smaller forces should be swallowed up by ideological polarisation, aided with the tool of a proposed 5-10 percent vote threshold mandatory to become a national party. This will surely draw up a strong bloc of parties opposed to such a scheme for spearheading a movement in a volatile situation. \nThe thunderous sounds in the streets were no longer of sound grenades and bullets. They were the reverberating cheers of thousands of people celebrating the culmination of an arduous, painful and, sadly, bloody journey to victory. It is, no doubt, a victory of the students and the people of Bangladesh. And it is the total defeat of a leader and government that has shown their most monstrous side by turning state machinery, along with their party goons, on their own people.This victory has come at the cost of hundreds of lives of overwhelmingly young people, mostly students. Even small children have not been spared—basically the future of this nation. Was it possible for a government to continue to stay in power after killing the country's future, for murdering ordinary citizens in cold blood? Was it possible for a leader to keep on denying the truth about these murders by her own direction, blaming them on her political opponents when the evidence is out in the open for all to see? Could any leader and cabinet be more detached from the pulse of the people, from the hearts of the youth?The outcome of the events of the last few weeks were inevitable. Even after killing more than 200 people in less than a week and with no let up from the protesters, Sheikh Hasina's obstinance prevailed. On August 4, the violence escalated to newer levels, leaving at least 93 dead. The former prime minister had become deaf to the cries of the people, blind to the sea of blood she had spilled with the help of the police, BGB, and the unnamed goons who fired guns right beside these forces. Thus, on August 5, despite an indefinite curfew being called, in spite of the memory of those chilling sounds of impending death, the people could not be held back. In Dhaka, the eerie calmness of the morning changed very quickly with crowds forming practically on every main thoroughfare, with the biggest one in Shahbag, where everyone seemed to congregate. As hard as it is to believe, only a little while ago, protesters had been shot near the Shaheed Minar and other areas.When the army started to clear the way for the crowd, the mood changed even more dramatically. Even before the news of the unseemly exit of the former prime minister from Gono Bhaban by helicopter started spreading, the sounds of freedom from a repressive regime that had shown just how merciless it could get to retain power, resonated throughout the streets. The incredibly brave young people of this country have steadfastly stood up once again against the full force of an autocratic government—and won!But volatility is a constant in our reality; all too soon, things did take an ugly turn. The pent-up anger of people was displayed in the most distasteful way with the ransacking of Gono Bhaban, seen as the seat of a hated regime, setting of fire to the Bangabandhu Bhaban at Dhanmondi 32 and to police stations all over the country, and attacks on houses and businesses belonging to the Hindu community and on their temples. The feeling of jubilation was tainted by the violence which went on without any hindrance. After watching children, students and ordinary citizens being ruthlessly murdered by the orders of the government, the fury of the public is understandable. But violence cannot bring justice for violence.This is the message that the members of the Bangladesh Student Uprising Central Committee have voiced during their press briefing on Channel 24. They have categorically told their fellow protesters to be vigilant of those taking advantage of the situation, who have carried out arson attacks and vandalism in order to malign the movement. They asked everyone to be mindful of instigators and refrain from any kind of looting, arson, communal violence and protect all minority communities and public assets. They have insisted that their movement is peaceful and has brought about a national unity that transcends political party or religion. They promised to stand against any kind of communal violence.The clarity and determination of these young leaders is awe-inspiring. More so because we have not heard our leaders talk like this for decades. Yes, we have claimed to be a democracy for the last 33 years. Yet, when was the last time we heard words like \"justice\" and \"equality\" from the mouth of a leader? When was the last time we heard that all cases of enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings would be tried and those involved would be brought to book?As of this writing, a group of representatives of the movement were set to visit Bangabhaban to meet up with the president. They have made it very clear that any government that comes without the endorsement of the members of the movement would not be acceptable and would result in the continuation of the movement.There are, of course, misgivings that the former regime will somehow manipulate the situation, that other players including extremist forces will take over. We don't know what lies ahead for us, and the uncertainty makes us jittery and holds us back from unreservedly celebrating this victory.But listening to the resolute voices of these young people who have a clear idea of what kind of country they want to build, one that enshrines the true values of democracy, one cannot help but feel hopeful that a real change, one that will truly free us from the suffocating clutch of fear, could actually be possible. When I see young protesters managing traffic and pictures of Muslims guarding Hindu temples on social media, the feeling gets stronger. Abu Sayed and his fellow martyrs would be proud.-The Daily Star (Bangladesh)/ANN \nCPN-UML Chair and current Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli is instinctively combative against anyone he sees as even remotely challenging his authority. Using his unmatched flair for Nepali idioms, he is a past master at verbally taking down the credibility of his political opponents. The good news for him is that after the exit from the UML of senior leaders like Madhav Kumar Nepal and Jhalanath Khanal in early 2021, Oli has near complete control over the party machinery. Yet the insecurity over the possible emergence of rival leaders apparently continues to gnaw at the septuagenarian leader. The much-discussed reentry of ex-Nepali President Bidya Devi Bhandari into the UML fold may have given Oli many sleepless nights. Bhandari is not his only headache. Speaking at a party meeting on Sunday, Oli warned the UML rank and file that no kind of factionalism would be tolerated in the party. He added, for good measure, that even though such diktats had been issued in the past, this time he was dead serious. But then the chairperson is himself being accused of promoting factionalism. For instance, Bishnu Paudel, a trusted lieutenant of Oli, was made the finance minister on top of his responsibility of monitoring the party’s organisational activities. But Prithivi Subba Gurung, the new minister of information and communication, who has often had testy ties with Oli, is now without any responsibility in the party. (Earlier, he used to lead the UML’s parliamentary affairs department.) The ‘burden’ of dual responsibilities is apparently fine for a leader close to the party chair, someone more distant cannot be similarly overburdened. While Oli spoke on Sunday, he was also hinting at the undesirability of other possible factions in his party. There seems to be great tussle between Pokharel and Paudel, two Oli stalwarts, for influence. Most recently, this was seen during the appointment of the chief minister of Lumbini Province, with Chet Nath Acharya (who is close to Pokharel) and Leela Giri (close to Paudel) duelling it out for the top job, with Acharya eventually coming out on top. This tussle seems to have displeased Oli, perhaps because it suggests even his close acolytes might not be under his total control.A degree of competition is not just desirable but healthy for political parties. Yet Oli is having none of it. He warned his party that the promotion of factional politics in the name of internal democracy is unacceptable. Factionalism and internal democracy are both anathema to Oli. Even while he may boast that he will run the party for another two decades, it is only natural for those in and outside the UML to think of his eventual successor as party chair. Only with the right kind of debate will the right candidate emerge. Trying to maintain complete control is one sure way to break the party, as Oli found out in 2021. It might have worked to his advantage back then, yet if something like that happens again, Oli’s political stature is sure to be diminished. Oli as the party’s custodian should be promoting healthy debates and discussions instead of trying to stifle dissent. As the undisputed leader of the UML, he has everything to gain by adopting this more democratic approach to governance.    \nAn Austrian teenager arrested over an alleged plot to strike a Taylor Swift concert in Vienna had built explosive devices for his attack and had pledged loyalty to Islamic State, authorities said on Thursday.The 19-year-old man, who has North Macedonian roots, made a full confession in custody, Austria’s general director for public security Franz Ruf told a news conference.He swore allegiance to the IS group, opens new tab’s leader on the internet and had chemicals, machetes, and technical devices at his home in the town of Ternitz in preparation for an attack, Ruf added.The suspect, whose name was not given, was planning a lethal assault among the estimated 20,000 “Swiftie” fans set to gather outside Ernst Happel Stadium, said national intelligence head Omar Haijawi-Pirchner.“He wanted to carry out an attack in the area outside the stadium, killing as many people as possible using the knives or even using the explosive devices he had made,” he said, adding there were no explicit threats to other concerts.Two other Austrian youths aged 17 and 15 were also detained on Wednesday over the foiled plot. Authorities painted a picture of the main suspect as having self-radicalised, transforming his appearance and sharing Islamist propaganda online. He quit his job on July 25, telling people he had \"big plans\", Ruf said.One neighbour told Austrian broadcaster Puls24 that he kept himself to himself and had grown a “Taliban beard”.Swift’s three concerts in Vienna, due to start on Thursday for a soldout 65,000 audience each, were cancelled, to the consternation of fans, many of whom had travelled far.“It’s just heartbreaking, just frustrating. But at the end of the day I guess it’s for everyone's safety,” said Mark del Rosario, who had flown from the Philippines to see the wildly popular U.S. singer.MUSIC WORLD ROCKEDU.S. broadcaster ABC cited law enforcement and intelligence sources as saying Austrian authorities had received information about the Swift concert threat from U.S. intelligence.It cited the sources as saying at least one of the suspects had pledged allegiance to ISIS-K, a resurgent wing of IS, on Telegram in June, though the plot was IS-inspired rather than directed by the group's operatives.Austrian Interior Minister Gerhard Karner said foreign intelligence agencies had helped with the investigation, as Austrian law does not allow monitoring of messenger apps.Event organiser Live Nation urged fans of Coldplay, which is due to play at the same stadium on Aug. 21, to stay calm and said it was in contact with authorities.It did not comment on whether the show would take place.British police said on Thursday there was nothing to indicate that the planned attack in Vienna would have an impact on Swift’s shows at Wembley Stadium in London next week.“Concerts are often a preferred target of Islamist attackers, large concerts,” said Karner, listing the 2015 attack on Paris' Bataclan venue and the 2017 bombing at the Manchester Arena where U.S. pop star Ariana Grande had played.The plot in Austria also brought to mind a foiled plan by three IS-linked suspects against Vienna's gay pride parade last year. IS was largely crushed by a U.S.-led coalition several years ago after establishing a “caliphate” in large areas of Iraq and Syria, but has still managed some major attacks while seeking to rebuild and reinvent itself.NATIONAL SECURITY REVAMPAustrian authorities have revamped their national security intelligence in the wake of a 2020 attack by a convicted jihadist in the centre of Vienna that left four dead, the first such militant attack in the Austrian capital in a generation.This week's shows were to be part of the record-breaking Eras Tour by the American singer-songwriter which started on March 17, 2023, in Glendale, Arizona, U.S., and is set to conclude on Dec. 8, 2024, in Vancouver, Canada.Swift, 34, has not yet commented on the cancellations on her official Instagram account which has 283 million followers.Her fans were horrified at the threat, with some begging organizers to postpone the concert instead of cancelling it outright. Promoters have said they will pay back tickets.“As disappointing as not being able to go to this concert is TRUST ME u do not want to experience that,” added another. \nNobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus returned home to strife-torn Bangladesh on Thursday, to lead a new interim government after weeks of tumultuous student protests forced Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to resign and flee to neighbouring India.The South Asian nation’s only Nobel laureate and a harsh critic of Hasina, Yunus, 84, arrived in Dhaka following medical treatment in Paris, after protesters backed him for the role in a government tasked with holding elections for a new leader.“I feel good coming back home,” the economist said at the airport, where he was greeted by top military officers and student leaders.The student protesters had saved the country and that freedom had to be protected, he said, adding, “Whatever path our students show us, we will move ahead with that.”Yunus is set to be sworn in as chief of a team of advisers at 14:30 GMT, at the official residence of President Mohammed Shahabuddin.Hasina’s Awami League party does not figure in the interim government after she resigned on Monday, following weeks of violence that killed about 300 people and injured thousands.In a Facebook post, her son Sajeeb Wazed Joy said the party had not given up, however, and was ready to hold talks with opponents and the interim government.“I had said my family will no longer be involved in politics but the way our party leaders and workers are being attacked, we cannot give up,” he said on Wednesday.Yunus, known as the ‘banker to the poor’, received the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for founding a bank that pioneered the fight on poverty through small loans to needy borrowers.Hasina’s dramatic exit from the country she ruled for 20 of the last 30 years, winning a fourth straight term in January, triggered jubilation and violence as crowds stormed and ransacked her official residence unopposed.She is sheltering at an air base near New Delhi, the Indian capital, a development that Yunus said sparked anger at India among some Bangladeshis.The student-led movement that ousted Hasina grew out of protests against quotas in government jobs that spiralled in July, provoking a violent crackdown that drew global criticism, though the government denied using excessive force.The protests were fuelled also by harsh economic conditions and political repression in the country, born after a war of liberation from Pakistan in 1971. \n An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.1 hit southwestern Japan on Thursday, triggering tsunami advisories, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) said, but there were no immediate signs of major damage.There have been no reports of abnormalities at nuclear power plants following the quake, and the government is checking for damage and casualties, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters.The quake occurred at around 4:43 pm off Miyazaki prefecture on the western major island of Kyushu, the JMA said.In Miyazaki, waves as high as 50 cm (20 inches) have already been observed, public broadcaster NHK said. \nMinister for Culture, Tourism, and Civil Aviation Badri Prasad Pandey on Thursday inspected the Air Dynasty chopper crash site in Shivapuri Rural Municipality-7 in Nuwakot.According to the minister’s secretariat, secretary Ganesh Prasad Pandey, officials from the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, representatives from security agencies, and Chief District Officer of Nuwakot Ram Krishna Adhikari were present during the inspection.Minister Pandey had planned to visit the crash site on Wednesday, but the visit was not possible due to an emergency Cabinet meeting, his secretariat said.On Wednesday night, Minister Pandey’s secretariat issued a press note stating that the minister has postponed previously scheduled formal programmes for a week to focus on immediate and long-term tasks related to air safety.All five people on board an Air Dynasty helicopter were killed when it crashed on a hillside located some 11 kilometres northwest of Kathmandu on Wednesday. The accident comes just two weeks after the Saurya Airlines crash in Kathmandu that killed 18 people. \nBangladesh is set to get a new, interim government headed by Nobel Peace Prize-winning economist Muhammad Yunus on Thursday, after weeks of tumultuous student protests forced Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to resign and flee to India.Yunus, 84, Bangladesh’s only Nobel laureate and a harsh critic of Hasina, was recommended for the job by the student protesters who led the campaign against Hasina.He was expected to be sworn in as chief adviser along with a team of advisers later on Thursday in an interim government which the army chief said may include 15 members, although discussions on the names continued till late on Wednesday.Hasina’s Awami League party was not involved in all-party discussions led by army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman, who announced Hasina’s resignation on Monday.Her son Sajeeb Wazed Joy said in a Facebook post late on Wednesday that the party had not given up yet and was ready to hold talks with opponents and the administration.“I had said my family will no longer be involved in politics but the way our party leaders and workers are being attacked, we cannot give up,” Joy said.Yunus is known as the ‘banker to the poor’ and was awarded the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for founding a bank that pioneered fighting poverty with small loans to needy borrowers.He is due to arrive in the capital Dhaka from Paris on Thursday, where he had been receiving medical treatment.“I’m looking forward to going back home and see what’s happening there and how we can organise ourselves to get out of the trouble that we’re in,” Yunus said before he boarded a flight on Wednesday evening.Hasina’s dramatic exit on Monday from the country she ruled for four terms - and was reelected to a fifth in January - triggered jubilation and violence across Bangladesh, as crowds stormed and ransacked her official residence unopposed.She fled to neighbouring India where she is taking shelter at an air base near the capital New Delhi.Student protests against quotas for government jobs spiralled in July, killing about 300 people and injuring thousands, as demonstrations were met with a violent crackdown that was criticised internationally although the government denied using excessive force.The protests were fuelled by tough economic conditions and political repression as well.After years of strong growth as the garment industry expanded, the $450 billion economy struggled with costly imports, inflation and unemployment and the government had sought a bailout from the International Monetary Fund.Yunus and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), Hasina’s main political opponent, called for calm and an end to violence on Wednesday.“No destruction, revenge or vengeance,” said Hasina’s arch rival and BNP leader Khaleda Zia, 78, in a video address from her hospital bed to hundreds of her supporters at a rally in Dhaka on Wednesday.Zia, who was released from house arrest on Tuesday, and her exiled son Tarique Rahman, addressed the rally and called for national elections to be held within three months.On Wednesday, a court overturned Yunus’ conviction in a labour case in which he was handed a six-month jail sentence in January. Yunus had called his prosecution political, part of a campaign by Hasina to quash dissent.“Let us make the best use of our new victory,” Yunus said. \nThousands of police and anti-racism protesters gathered on streets across Britain on Wednesday to challenge expected far-right groups that failed to materialise following more than a week of violent racist attacks targeting Muslims and migrants.Britain has been hit by a series of riots that erupted early last week after three young girls were killed in a knife attack in Southport, northwest England, triggering a wave of false messaging online that wrongly identified the suspected killer as an Islamist migrant.Posts online had said far-right, anti-Muslim protesters would target a list of immigration centres, migrant support centres and specialist law firms on Wednesday, prompting many businesses to close early and some shops to board up windows.The reports prompted the deployment of thousands of police officers, and crowds of protesters massed in towns and cities including London, Bristol, Birmingham, Liverpool and Hastings, holding banners saying \"Fight racism\", \"Stop the far right\" and \"Will trade racists for refugees\".The protesters were made up of a diverse collection of Muslims, anti-racist and anti-fascist groups, trade unionists, left-wing organisations, and locals appalled at the riots that had hit the country.By 9 p.m. (2000 GMT) there were no reports of any serious disorder. Police said around 50 people in Croydon, south London, had thrown bottles and were trying to cause disruption.Waste collector Stetson Matthew, 64, who joined thousands of demonstrators in Walthamstow, northeast London, said people had the right to protest but that the targeting of ethnic minorities had put the country on edge.\"Everybody has the right to do what they need to do but what they must do is to put their voices across peacefully, amicably, without any stress or violence,\" he said.One woman who joined a counter protest in Hastings, southeast England, said she was relieved to see a large turnout.\"I felt I absolutely had to be here tonight to take a stand, and it is much easier for me to come as a white woman then for some of my non-white friends, so I’m here in solidarity,\" said 37-year-old Lucy, a flower grower, who declined to give her last name.‘Stop the boats’Riots erupted last week when groups of a few hundred mostly men clashed with police and smashed windows of hotels housing asylum-seekers from Africa, Asia and the Middle East, chanting “get them out” and “stop the boats” - a reference to those arriving in Britain in small dinghies without permission.They have also pelted mosques with rocks, prompting Muslim organisations to issue community safety advice.Prime Minister Keir Starmer, a former chief prosecutor who is facing his first crisis since winning a July 4 election, has warned rioters they would face lengthy jail terms as he seeks to stamp out the worst outbreak of violence in Britain in 13 years.A 58-year-old man was jailed for three years for violent disorder on Wednesday, while two others, aged 41 and 29, were sentenced to 20 and 30 months, respectively.“This is the swift action we’re taking. If you provoke violent disorder on our streets or online, you will face the full force of the law,” Starmer said.Migration to Britain was a major factor in its 2016 vote to leave the European Union and it was a battleground during last month’s election, with Nigel Farage’s Reform Party winning around 4 million votes on calls for tighter border controls.Britain saw record net migration levels in 2022, with numbers buoyed by those arriving from Ukraine and Hong Kong, and through work and student visas.Net migration through legal means was some 685,000 in 2023, while 29,000 people arrived on small boast across the Channel, many having fled war zones. The far-right chants of “stop the boats” was also a slogan of the Conservative Party before it was swept out of power after 14 years at the election.The government has put together a so-called “standing army” of 6,000 specialist police officers to respond to any violence.The National Police Chiefs’ Council said more than 120 people had been charged and 428 arrests made in connection with the disorder. \nThe weather across the country is expected to be partly to generally cloudy on Thursday. According to the Meteorological Forecasting Division, light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is likely in some areas of Koshi, Bagmati, Gandaki, Lumbini, Karnali, and Sudurpaschim provinces, with a few areas in Madhesh Province also experiencing similar conditions. There is a possibility of heavy rainfall in one or two locations within Bagmati, Gandaki, Lumbini, and Sudurpaschim provinces.Tonight, the skies will remain generally cloudy throughout the country. Light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is anticipated at some places in Koshi, Gandaki, Lumbini, and Sudurpaschim provinces, and at a few areas of the remaining provinces. Heavy rainfall may occur in one or two locations within Koshi, Gandaki, Lumbini, and Sudurpaschim provinces.Currently, the country is under the influence of monsoon winds, with the monsoon trough situated near its average position.On Wednesday, the highest maximum temperature recorded was 34°C in Simara, while the lowest minimum temperature was 15°C in Jomsom. Nepalgunj received the highest rainfall of 111 mm in the past 24 hours. \nKaran Vaidya is the honorary consul of the Republic of Latvia in Nepal and has served as the vice president of Vaidya Group since 2017. A bibliophile since childhood, he finds inspiration in reading and plans to write books in the future.In this conversation with the Post’s Sanskriti Pokharel, Vaidya discusses the role of reading in his personal and professional life and the genres he gravitates towards.How have your studies and experiences abroad influenced your duties as the Honorary Consul for the Republic of Latvia in Nepal?My education has taken me to various parts of the world, including the US, India, the UK, and China. This exposure has shaped my personality and character, moulding how I process information, think critically, and make decisions.My engineering degree at Purdue University, US, not only taught me engineering but also altered how I perceive systems and problems. It honed my ability to identify issues, deconstruct them, and devise effective solutions.How has reading influenced your professional, personal, and diplomatic professional growth?I have been an avid book reader since childhood. Reading is a habit that has influenced every aspect of my life. Books like ‘Power of Habit’ by Charles Duhigg and books on Stoicism by Ryan Holiday and Stoic philosophers have helped me create a disciplined routine.Professionally, I read depending on what skills I need to improve. Currently, I'm reading ‘Contagious’ by Jonah Berger. It's about the influence and effectiveness of word-of-mouth marketing in today’s digital era. Last month, I finished ‘Never Split the Difference’, a brilliant book by Chris Voss about negotiation skills. Staying informed about current affairs is crucial to diplomacy. That's why I always look for good geopolitics and international relations books.How do you pursue your interests in literature, culinary arts, and music alongside your busy work schedule?I love immersing myself in the arts and creativity, but my work often limits my time for creative pursuits. To stimulate my brain's logical and creative sides, I follow a routine. I set aside time daily to read a few pages from three books. Two of them, ‘The Daily Stoic’ and ‘The Daily Laws’, are short and straightforward, featuring a daily quote and its explanation. When I have more time in the evening, I try to read 20 to 50 pages of another book.Reading is a habit that enhances personal growth, so I always strive to gain wisdom from the words I read. Saturdays are my dedicated cooking days, which I enjoy. Unfortunately, I’ve had to put music on hold for a while. My guitar has been waiting for me to play it.What genres do you prefer, and in what ways do they align with your personal and professional goals?In fiction, I’m drawn to books featuring powerful yet realistic characters and those with a solid foundation of ethics and morality. These characters inspire me and help me remain steadfast in my ethical principles.I am focused on becoming a good executive in my profession. To support this goal, I delve into many nonfiction topics, such as management theory, emotional intelligence, and leadership.I also connect with Stoic philosophy. Its focus on emotional resilience, acceptance of impermanence, and understanding what we can and cannot control aligns well with my approach to handling life's challenges. During tough times, Stoicism guides me.What advice would you give young professionals and entrepreneurs about the value of reading?I encourage them to read consistently. It’s not just about gaining knowledge but also about sparking creative ideas. Start with a simple goal, like reading two pages daily, then gradually increase to four, eight, or ten pages. This small commitment can turn into a lasting habit. Over time, reading ten pages a day means you can finish a 300-page book in a month. This consistency will broaden your perspective and help you advance in your career.Karan Vaidya’s book recommendationsAtlas ShruggedAuthor: Ayn RandPublisher: Penguin Random HouseYear: 1957This novel presents Rand’s philosophy of objectivism in fictional form.

You can say 'Meditations' introduced me to Stoicism.Power of Habit Author: Charles DuhiggPublisher: Random House Trade PaperbacksYear: 2012It thoughtfully examines how habits influence our lives and how we can leverage them to improve ourselves. This book can help readers establish a disciplined routine.Power of Now Author: Eckhart TollePublisher: New World LibraryYear: 2004This book is a transformative guide to living in the present, transcending the ego, and finding inner peace. I'm thankful I read it while still in school, as it awakened my spiritual side.Man’s Search for MeaningAuthor: Victor E. FranklPublisher: Beacon PressYear: 2006This one is about the author’s Holocaust experiences. A memorable quote from the book is, \"The man, whose self-esteem depended on others' respect, is emotionally destroyed.\" \nA fresh study has emphasised the need for Nepal to adopt a comprehensive approach to navigating the complexities of its upcoming graduation from a Least Developed Country in 2026. The study, Nepal LDC Graduation: Report on Trade Policy Reforms to Mitigate the Impact on WTO Obligations, was commissioned by the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies, with support from the European Union Nepal Trade and Investment Programme (TIP). It was presented at a public-private dialogue.The study highlights the need for Nepal to reform its legislative and regulatory frameworks, enhance institutional procedures, improve human resource capabilities, diversify export markets, and bolster international collaboration.Policymakers, trade experts, development partners, and private sector representatives agree that Nepal must expedite legal and policy reforms and strengthen institutional and human resource capacities to better prepare for post-graduation trade scenarios.Krishna Bahadur Raut, secretary at the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies, who presided over the programme, said the government seriously considers the concerns of, and suggestions from, the private sector regarding Nepal’s preparations. He also pledged efforts from the government side to ensure post-graduation benefits for Nepal.Debraj Joshi, joint-secretary at the ministry, said Nepal’s graduation presents both challenges and opportunities, adding that the country needs to continue reforms in trade-related policies and laws.Purushottam Ojha, a trade expert and former commerce secretary, emphasised the importance of adhering to new WTO obligations, including agreements on agriculture, subsidies, Agreements on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), and Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) for smooth transition.Abhijit Das, an International Trade Expert from the International Trade Centre, cautioned that the transition leads to stricter rules and reduced benefits, such as the loss of lower tariffs and stressed the urgency for implementing the action plan to ensure a smooth transition from the LDC status.Shobha Gyawali, president of the Federation of Nepal Women Entrepreneurs’ Association, said that Nepal is not yet mature enough for LDC graduation, and demanded benefits for women entrepreneurs from international trade.Other representatives of the private sector said the graduation seems to have been planned without due preparation, given the low competitiveness of Nepali businessmen and the higher cost of production and export compared to other countries.The study also cautions that Nepal will lose trade preferences under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) and Duty-Free Quota-Free schemes, potentially leading to higher tariffs on exports. It recommends detailed diagnostic study to identify vulnerable products and markets, exploring alternative trade arrangements like GSP-Plus in the European Union, and raising industry awareness through workshops.Strengthening national capacity to address non-tariff barriers, developing national standards, forming mutual recognition agreements with key trade partners, promoting products prioritised by the Nepal Trade Integration Strategy (NTIS) 2023, drawing lessons from other LDC-graduated countries, fostering partnership among governments, private sector, and international partners, are other recommendations of the study to ensure a successful transition by mitigating the impacts of LDC graduation. \nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nMost economists believe spending on infrastructure has a significant multiplier effect. During the construction phase, infrastructure generates real cash flow for workers and their families. In the long run, it has a direct and indirect impact on the economy, with a multiplier effect, particularly in job creation.In Rupandehi, which hosts the industrial city Bhairahawa, and Lumbini, a landmark of the Buddhist world listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1997, infrastructure built with a sizeable investment has gone to waste.Big infrastructure projects like the international convention centre, meditation centre, industrial zones, and Gautam Buddha International Airport have failed to generate income and have turned into veritable white elephants.Nature has started reclaiming most of the under-utilised infrastructure.Since 2010, talk of building an international airport led to the construction of large-scale infrastructure, including a bevy of luxury hotels.Proliferating factories and a rapidly spreading transport network turned the Butwal-Bhairahawa metroplex into an economic powerhouse.Nepal opened its second international airport in May 2022 in the southern city of Bhairahawa, but no international flight stops there right now.The objective of building an international airport in Bhairahawa was to bring in more tourists, energise businesses and create jobs. But the situation is just the opposite. Traders are closing down their shops and moving abroad for decent jobs.The private sector, too, invested heavily. When the finished project started to sit idle, it hit the sector, and many enterprises were teetering into bankruptcy.Economists term this development in Lumbini a cascading failure—a breakdown in a system of interconnected parts in which the failure of one or few parts leads to the failure of other parts. Hem Raj Regmi, deputy chief statistician and data curator at the National Statistics Office, said Lumbini province saw heavy investment from the government and the private sector, but the output has slowed. “Enterprises are unable to raise even the operating cost.”In the last fiscal year, Lumbini province was estimated to grow at 4.05 percent to a GDP of Rs814 billion, from the low base of the 1.99 percent growth it had achieved in the previous fiscal year. Lumbini is estimated to contribute 14.26 percent to the national GDP. The highest value-added growth rate in Lumbini was in electricity and gas, which grew by 28.93 percent, while the manufacturing sector was estimated to shrink by a negative 1.43 percent in the last fiscal year.Most completed infrastructures in Lumbini have become white elephants, as their expenditures have been growing instead of them generating income. The Butwal International Convention Center, built with an investment of Rs1.11 billion in ward 10 of Butwal Sub Metropolis, is currently without business. The centre has 13 halls, each with a capacity to accommodate 2,700 people. The auditorium is the largest of the 13.The government built the convention centre to organise national and international conferences and events, but it is not generating much income. Construction started in 2014 and the centre was inaugurated in August 2022.Officials say that the centre is struggling to pay its staff. While the centre is under-utilised and lacks maintenance, bushes have grown around it.Dharmendra Panthi, chief of the Butwal International Convention Center project, said 22 events or functions have been conducted in the past three years, earning Rs4 million. The centre is currently closed as the provincial cabinet is yet to pass the operating guidelines even in three years.However, Panthi said they have been occasionally renting the hall on request. The centre charges Rs96,000 for a day-long event.Prabin Pathak, president of the Nepal Hoteliers Association, who took part in a recent function at the convention centre, said the infrastructure is in a sorry state due to lack of periodic maintenance.“If the building is not utilised properly, it will be a waste of tax money,” said Pathak. “The washroom faucets are dry, and it is difficult to sit in the hall due to the stench from the washroom.”“In Nepal, there is a growing trend of building new infrastructure, but their upkeep is often ignored. This is sad,” Pathak said. “No one is accountable for the losses the projects incur. Similarly, questions are raised about the quality of construction. In most projects, low-quality materials are used, severely compromising the structural integrity.”A hall with a capacity to accommodate 5,000 people built near the Buddha’s birthplace, Lumbini, has yet to do any business, except hosting a few functions. It was built with an investment of Rs720 million.Sanuraja Shakya, member-secretary of the Lumbini Development Trust, said that if a social organisation wants to conduct a function at the centre, they have to pay a fee.Shakya said that since it is a meditation centre, they do not allow other functions, especially those involving entertainment.Questions were raised about the construction when the roof started leaking soon after project’s completion. It was repaired later.Likewise, the Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in Bhairahawa, has not been fully operational for a long time. As factories have not been set up in the SEZ, the area has turned into a jungle. Construction of the SEZ had started in 2003 and it was inaugurated in 2014.Located in south-central Nepal, the Bhairahawa Special Economic Zone has 69 industrial plots of sizes from 1,400 to 3,700 square metres. A few industrialists have booked plots, but have not set up their plants as the government has failed to provide pledged services and amenities. The government had promised to provide 24-hour electricity, a one-stop service system, customs, banks, and insurance among other things inside the SEZ.“Every year, new entrepreneurs book plots, but do not set up their factories due to associated tough conditions,” said Saput Dumre, assistant director of SEZ. Dumre said industrialists are concerned about the mandatory export provision. According to SEZ guidelines, which were amended three months ago, firms that lease space inside the SEZ must export at least 30 percent of manufactured goods. “There is a water tank in the SEZ, but it has no water, the weighing machine does not work, the petrol pump is defunct, there are no parking areas, and the road is covered in thick bushes,” said Ujjwal Prasad Kasaju, a central member of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry. Then there is the new Gautam Buddha International Airport—all dressed up, and nowhere to go. The airport awaits applications for flight slots from international airlines after more than two years of opening.Nepal's second international airport was ready after ten years and nearly Rs40 billion pumped into the project, but despite the build-up, the expected rush of eager carriers is nowhere to be seen.The airport is a landmark located in south central Nepal and spread over 787 bighas (533 hectares).The modern facility has a 15,169-square-metre terminal building that can serve nearly a million passengers a year. The airport's 3,000-metre runway is long enough to handle the largest commercial jets. However, no commercial jet wants to fly to the airport. \nIn Kathmandu, where construction dust often clouds the air, the resumption of the pavement widening project at New Road on July 17 has elicited mixed reactions. While some citizens harbour doubts and disagreements, people with disabilities have their fingers crossed as well. For Narayani Dawadi, who is visually impaired, the initiative offers hope and apprehension in equal measures. She worries that the Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) might overlook the parameters for disabled-friendly infrastructure and execute the project superficially.Dawadi’s scepticism is not unwarranted. Her distrust stems from her 20 years of experience navigating Kathmandu, where she has become familiar with its footpaths and pavements. Despite this familiarity, she cannot navigate confidently due to the ever-changing, unpredictable condition of the pavements.“I don’t know if I can call the footpaths accessible,” Dawadi says. “There is tactile paving for white cane users but it’s not perfect. Sometimes they guide us to a pole or a tree, and in many places, there are only partial tactile guides, leaving us confused.”Her experience highlights a recurring issue: lack of a reliable, consistent infrastructure for people with disabilities in Kathmandu.The roads and footpaths that appear fine during the day are often damaged or under-construction by the evening, giving people with disabilities a hard time navigating them.Dawadi isn’t entirely critical; she appreciates the KMC’s sidewalk widening projects and regulations on street vending and parking. Areas like Baneshwar have become much easier to navigate, Dawadi says.However, Dawadi hopes the KMC doesn’t just displace street vendors without providing alternatives. “They need options that won’t affect their income; a crackdown won’t work.”Dawadi emphasises that KMC shouldn’t view current projects as a complete solution to make public infrastructure ‘disabled-friendly.’ Issues like half-finished tactile paving, narrow roads, and misplaced poles and tiles need to be addressed. “People with disabilities should be involved in planning,” she says.Rishi Dhakal, 44, a wheelchair user for the past 21 years and president of the Spinal Cord Injury Network Nepal, says that while the KMC has been building new footpaths and pavements with nice bricks and tiles, they often fail to meet the measurements for wheelchair use.Rishi notes that the footpath in Narayantar, between Bagmati Bridge to Jorpati Chowk, has become easier for pedestrians and the visually impaired due to reduced parking and fewer street vendors. But it remains inaccessible for wheelchair users due to a lack of proper slopes.“On many footpaths, especially at crossroads, the slope is not favourable for wheelchairs to climb,” he explains. “The footpath has become just a showpiece.”Rishi and his organisation are working to arrange a meeting with the minister and secretary of the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport to present a memorandum advocating for wheelchair-friendly slopes on Kathmandu’s footpaths. On July 21, Rishi met with the ministry’s Joint Secretary Sushil Babu Dhakal to discuss the next steps.While Rishi appreciates the ongoing work to widen pavements on New Road, he doubts the standard measurements for slopes and inclined planes for wheelchair users will be adhered to, citing KMC’s recent work on footpaths near Tribhuvan International Airport where the slopes are inaccessible.Another wheelchair user, Muskan Adhikari, pointed to a double problem of inaccessibility: footpaths lack slopes, and the sky bridges are not wheelchair-friendly. Moreover, she has faced incidents where vehicles did not stop at crossings when traffic police were absent, leading to several close calls.Rishi’s organisation has also received reports of incidents of wheelchair users being hit by vehicles in the Jorpati area.“The constitution promises accessible infrastructure for people with disabilities to navigate independently, but the current footpaths and infrastructure makes independent travel very difficult,” Adhikari said. “Forget pavements, even government offices are not accessible.”Rishi says that even the Health Ministry is only accessible up to the first floor, “forcing us to wait all day for meetings as ministers do not sit on the first floor.” This lack of accessibility extends to the KMC office itself, which has a metal ramp that is extremely difficult for wheelchair users to use and there is no tactile paving either.Vishwo Shrestha, director at the Blind Youth Association Nepal, reveals that their organisation frequently receives reports of blind and visually impaired individuals falling into sewers and rivers due to inadequate safety measures. In Sukedhara, where several offices catering to the blind community are located, a lack of proper fences along Dhobikhola river had previously resulted in accidents. The association had petitioned the KMC a year and a half ago for guard rails or road safety barriers.“Despite the installation of guard rails, there have been recent cases of individuals falling into the river due to gaps in the barriers,” Shrestha says. Shrestha adds that while not all incidents are reported, they receive two to three cases every two months involving falls into rivers or sewers. Many incidents involving collisions with poles or trees due to poor tactile guidance or uneven footpaths go unreported. “This reflects a major failure of the state’s duty,” he said.Meanwhile, for 36-year-old Radha Kumal, a blind white cane user, problems in footpaths and pavements are just part of the larger problems in the country’s road infrastructure. “We don’t know where the zebra cross begins, and traffic lights are useless for us as we cannot see the colour change,” she says. Many like Kumal hope for audio signals at traffic lights to ensure safe and independent road crossings.Sukhdev Ray, 41, who is deaf and lives in Baneshwar, points out a different but equally critical issue: lack of proper signage. “Without clear directional signs in public spaces like pavements, it’s hard for us to find our destinations,” Ray says. “As I can’t hear, I rely on signs for guidance.”Ray also adds that many traffic lights either malfunction or are ignored by drivers. “Crossing the road can be chaotic,” he notes. “With drivers in a rush and traffic lights often disregarded, I often fear getting hit, like I was the last time.”Ray was hit by a motorcycle while walking at Satdobato four months ago. Though he didn’t suffer major injuries, he is still reminded of the incident while walking on the road. He was also hit by a Safa tempo twice in Bhaisepati in June.Sugam Bhattarai, general secretary of the National Federation of the Disabled Nepal (NFDN), acknowledges that the KMC’s new footpaths and railings are a step forward but “they are usually limited to major areas like New Road and lack comprehensive accessibility features.”According to Bhattarai, in Nepal, the term ‘disabled-friendly’ often translates to just adding tactile paving and a ramp, ticking off an ‘inclusivity checklist’ without genuinely addressing accessibility needs. “What about individuals with deafness or intellectual disabilities?” he questions. The Act Relating to Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 2017, and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD), which Nepal has ratified, mandate accessibility to infrastructure.Article 9 of the UNCRPD says, “States Parties shall take appropriate measures to ensure to persons with disabilities access to the physical environment, transportation, information and communications, and other facilities and services open or provided to the public, both in urban and in rural areas.”Despite these legal frameworks, implementation remains inconsistent.Kumal shared that the ongoing pavement widening project at New Road has uprooted both sides of the road, leaving no alternative paths or assistance for the blind. “There’s no guidance or facilities for us,” she said.Shrestha criticises the KMC’s approach for lacking provisions for the blind and visually impaired. “Construction continues without first ensuring alternative routes or proper information,” he said.Nabin Manandhar, spokesperson for the KMC, assures that their pavement widening project at New Road includes considerations for disability access. “While we’re committed to making footpaths accessible, we’re not yet at the stage where we can address all types of disabilities,” he said.“We’ve just started. We welcome suggestions and acknowledge that we can’t address every issue alone.”Baburam Bhattarai, an expert member at the City Planning Commission under the KMC, emphasised that new projects adhere to disability guidelines. “We are monitoring compliance and plan to address issues with old pavements, including complaints about obstructing electric poles,” he said.However, officials blame funding constraints as a barrier in implementing good ideas.In 2021, the Department of Roads allocated Rs50 million for disabled-friendly pavements. The first phase (1.5km from Putalisadak to Thapathali) was completed, but the second phase at Durbarmarg and Jamal was halted due to budget constraints, according to Narayan Dutta Bhandari, division chief of the Road Division of Kathmandu.Rishi said that they, along with the NFDN, will start monitoring construction across the capital. If the right parameters are not followed, they will negotiate with the KMC, even if it means halting the work, he said.“We’ve learned to navigate the inconveniences in Kathmandu’s pavements and roads, but that doesn’t mean they’re not problematic,” Kumal says. “Accessible infrastructure is our right. While we do our best to adapt, we expect the government to adapt to our needs as well.” \nThe Monetary Policy for Fiscal Year 2024-25 issued last Friday by the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB), the monetary authority of Nepal, is generally hailed as expansionary. Nepal’s stock market responded positively to it, triggering a bull run and circuit breaks on Sunday’s trade, the first day of trading after the policy announcement. The Nepal Stock Exchange Index crossed the 2,700 mark after 29 months.The market seemed to have responded positively to the abolition of the Rs200 million ceiling to institutional investors in margin-type lending by the bank and financial institutions, an extension of the loan repayment period for the construction businesses by the end of December 2024, and provision for uncollateralised loans to those going for foreign employment, among others. These, indeed, are more reactive than well-thought-out sustainable policy responses that are unlikely to deliver desirable impacts on containing the severe recessionary trends faced by the economy.Monetary policy-makingFor decades now, Nepal’s monetary policy formulation has been a ritual orchestration rather than a substantive assertion of legally empowered independence by the NRB. The first compromise on monetary policy independence emanated from the fact that the Nepali currency is strictly pegged with the Indian currency. Pragmatically, the pluses of this arrangement may outweigh the minuses for the Nepali economy, so policymakers are not even considering discontinuing it.First, according to the universally acclaimed monetary theory of the impossible trinity, “a country can’t have a fixed exchange rate, independent monetary policy, and free capital movement all at once”. This means that no monetary policy can be ‘independent’ as long as it is pegged with any other currency. But we continue to embrace this impossibility.Second, the central bank shoulders three distinct responsibilities: Controlling inflation, ensuring financial sector stability through supervision and regulation, and, for all practical purposes, functioning as the government's key development finance agency. This reality has often obviated the NRB from an undivided focus on the 'core' central banking functions of money supply, inflation targeting and aversion to systemic risk.Third, the monetary authority and the monetary policy it brings out are often burdened with undue expectations beyond their jurisdiction and capacity. For example, a monetary policy is expected to come out with stimulus packages to ‘rescue’ the economy reeling down the recession, which could be appropriately addressed only by a bold and creative fiscal policy. The monetary policy can only complement this endeavour by managing financial resources for the same.Fourth and the saddest of all, the central bank is exhausting all its autonomy and energy in utterly un-innovative ritualisation of the tasks it should have shed decades ago. For instance, the directed lending policies in the name of the priority sector, deprived sector or the schemes aimed at financial inclusion should no longer be part of monetary policy since they may give rise to a conflict of interests between the roles of a regulator and concessional development financer. The most striking ambiguity of the sort is manifested in the NRB dilemma in dealing with microfinance institutions.The missesThe Monetary Policy appeared as if the central bank was unaware of the current economic malaise and the sources of recalcitrant stagnation. One major sector where the banks have over-invested in the past and suffocated at present is real estate. Except for raising the credit limit from 50 to 70 percent of the valuation to the homeowners with a ‘proven tax file’, the policy has left the land and housing entrepreneurs completely at bay. With India reducing duties on gold imports by 9 percent, as announced in the country’s annual budget last week, the gold market in Nepal, for better or worse, is going to be impacted differently. It will have a bearing on both investment and foreign exchange reserves. The new monetary policy grossly overlooks this phenomenon.Despite repeating a decade-old idea of setting up a second-tier oversight institution to regulate the saving and credit cooperatives and streamlining the operations of the microfinance institutions, the policy has blatantly failed to reinvigorate the small-and-medium-enterprise (SME) ecosystem. At present, the SMEs of Nepal face a grave crisis of legal/official recognition that has, in turn, impeded their access to formal financing mechanisms.The Economic Census of Nepal 2018 has shown that out of 923,356 establishments, only 462,605, or 50.1 percent, are registered. The rest—49.9 percent—have no legal identity. These are important entities providing self-employment and livelihood support to a large population. However, they have hardly any scope to find sizable investments and scale up their operations to enable them to reap the benefits of economies of scale. Again, it must not be misconstrued that the central bank should be directly involved in financing these SMEs. However, as a policy-maker, it should make functional arrangements by engaging relevant stakeholders like the subnational governments to facilitate and recognise grassroots businesses. This reflects the glaring gap in the public policymaking mindset that devolved financial power under federal polity can help optimise implementation, including monetary policy.Flimsy approachSome haphazard and over-ambitious policies have only eroded the central bank’s credibility as the regulator. A provision not to blacklist the contractors deliberately issuing bank checks without adequate balance in their accounts is in direct contravention of the best universal practices in banking.The monetary policy proposes to support the government in achieving an economic growth rate of 6 percent, as proposed by the budget of the current fiscal year, through liquidity management and credit disbursement towards the productive sector. It projects the broad money supply to be at 12.0 percent and credit disbursement to the private sector to grow at 12.5 percent. This means an increase of about Rs660 billion from the current Rs5.3 trillion disbursements of loans.The target is clearly to invest about Rs700 billion worth of loanable funds now lying idle in the system. This is a huge ask considering that during 11 months of the last fiscal year, loans from banks to the private sector increased only by 5.1 percent.The policy also fails to address the risk of alarmingly increasing non-performing assets in the banking system, making the banks more hesitant to invest aggressively. Such policy orchestration does not support the wider agenda of overdue structural reform of the financial system.  \nWhen the Ranjitkar group was established, they discovered this forgotten dance and devoted two years to researching it.Now, they are reintroducing it during Indra Jatra by training the new generation in this traditional art form. \nHe is known for his nationalist legacy, marked by the amendment of Nepal's map to include territories like Kalapani, Lipulekh, and Limpiyadhura, and his strong stance against India, especially during and after the 2015 Nepal blockade.But how did he rise to become the country's powerful man? \nPyakuryal holds a Phd in Public Affairs from the University of Akron, US. In this interview, they discuss Nepal’s elusive political stability, the narratives governing Nepali politics, the role of patriarchy, and the trends in Nepali politics Pyakuryal will be closely following in the years ahead. \n\nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli has told the members of the parliamentary State Affairs and Good Governance Committee that he wouldn’t engage in any kind of corruption nor will he tolerate such activities.Oli was charged with ‘policy corruption’ in the Giri Bandhu tea estate scam, mainly by the Nepali Congress, before the formation of the current government. Nepali Congress is now the main coalition partner in the Oli government.While participating in the meeting to discuss amendments to the bill related to the Prevention of Corruption Act-2002 at the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee on Tuesday, Oli claimed that all allegations against him in corruption were attempts to smear him.“I have never committed corruption in my life,” Oli said. “I do not tolerate corruption… Corruption committed beyond my notice is a different matter.”Oli’s claim comes less than two months after he was scrutinised for his alleged involvement in the tea estate land swap scam. In early June, pressure mounted in Parliament to investigate the Oli government's decision to permit the Giri Bandhu tea estate in Jhapa to swap its land with plots elsewhere in the Koshi province. Many political parties in Parliament were zeroing in on the idea that the multi-billion-rupee scam must be probed.The Supreme Court on February 7 overturned the erstwhile Oli government’s decision on the tea estate land swap. On April 26, 2021, a government led by Oli, who is also the CPN-UML chairman, allowed the tea estate to reap benefits from land holdings above the legal ceiling.The Supreme Court’s full text of the verdict on the tea estate, issued on May 12, had sparked political and legal debates. Subsequently, Nepali Congress, the main opposition at the time, demanded an investigation into the decision-making process of the land swap permit.The Congress's parliamentary party meeting on May 14 officially clarified its position and demanded an investigation into the issue. But after the change in coalition partners following the Congress-UML midnight deal on July 1 the tea estate issue has taken a back seat.Hitraj Pandey, the chief whip of CPN (Maoist Centre) and a member of the committee, doubts the prime minister's claims.Pandey alleges that the present coalition of the Congress and the UML was formed as the two largest parties were afraid of the earlier Maoist-led government's zero tolerance of corruption. Therefore, Oli, who leads the Congress-UML government, is not serious about corruption control, Pandey argues.Former coalition partners Maoist Centre and Rastriya Swatantra Party claim that after their government detained Bechan Jha, who was linked to the fake Bhutanese refugee issue, the Congress and the UML had teamed up to topple the earlier government.Corruption control is best served by action—not words, Pandey told the Post. He also claimed to have said the same thing to Prime Minister Oli upon completion of his address.Chitra Bahadur KC of Rastriya Janamorcha said that Oli saying he won’t indulge in corruption is not a new thing. KC is a committee member, who was a deputy prime minister during Oli’s first prime ministerial stint in 2015.Corruption has become a trend in Nepal, KC told the Post. “It cannot be prevented only by laws while leaders continue to commit it.”Meanwhile, during his address to the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee, Prime Minister Oli said that effective corruption control and prevention is necessary to drive the country on the path of development. He added that the government would amend laws related to corruption to maintain good governance.“I would like to assure all the lawmakers that there will be no corruption from my side,” Oli said. The prime minister said that the government would take strict action against corrupt people. This is Oli’s first participation in a meeting of the parliamentary committee after becoming the prime minister on July 15.On July 31, Oli was summoned to the committee to discuss the ‘peace and security and prison management’ agenda. However, he sent Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak to the meeting, citing his busy schedule. \nIn Nepali Congress, the position of general secretary is considered the second most powerful after the party president.Historically, some charismatic leaders have held the position in the country’s grand old party: from Krishna Prasad Bhattarai in the 1950s, to Mahendra Narayan Nidhi, Girija Prasad Koirala, to now the duo of Gagan Thapa and Bishwa Prakash Sharma.When two relatively younger and popular leaders—Thapa and Sharma—got elected as general secretaries in December 2021, they had kindled hope among young Congress members and well-wishers of the party.But over time, they have failed to implement their agendas as the establishment led by party chief Deuba is dominant. Political analysts and observers, too, say that Thapa and Sharma have failed to reflect the strength of their popular mandate in the party decision making process.Prior to its 14th general convention, the party had the provision of one elected general secretary whereas the other was nominated by the party President after the general convention. In the last convention, the party amended its statute and made it mandatory to elect both the general secretaries and other party bearers through voting.With Thapa and Sharma elected as the Congress general secretaries, they were expected to challenge the septuagenarian party President Sher Bahadur Deuba.However, as a party insider claims, the general secretary duo themselves are struggling to create their space in party leadership. This struggle is a testament to the challenges they face in cementing their influence in the Congress, says a party leader.“The party’s general secretary is usually occupied with official work,” Prakash Sharan Mahat, a Congress spokesperson, told the Post. “How active they are in the party’s internal affairs is not something I can comment on.”After being elected as the party’s general secretaries, Thapa and Sharma have publicly spoken about being kept in the dark on vital matters. For instance, while speaking at the 42nd BP Memorial programme held on July 20, Thapa said the July 1 agreement between Congress and CPN-UML reached to form a new coalition government came as a surprise.Purushottam Dahal, a senior journalist close to the Congress, says the two general secretaries didn’t understand their exact role.“The general secretary’s role is to make the party’s central secretariat functional, but they are trying to be reactionary, which is inappropriate,” Dahal told the Post. “To make the party functional, they should not wait for a green signal from the party president.”However, General Secretary Sharma rubbishes such a claim.“There have been some transformative changes in the party after we assumed the role of general secretaries,” Sharma told the Post. “From establishing a library in the party’s central office to holding the BP Koirala Literature Festival, we have made the party more vibrant.”He argued that what has happened is that the duo have failed to publicise some of their important works.The general secretaries claim they are facing difficulties because of the party leadership’s working style, but some leaders don’t buy that argument.Sharma further claims that their work is often hindered by the generational gap with Deuba.“In addition, both of us general secretaries were elected from different panels during the general convention, which caused some misunderstanding among party leaders,” Sharma said.But there are other Congress leaders who accuse the general secretaries of suddenly turning risk-averse. “They are bound by the party statute as the party follows a presidential system where the president prevails over others,” Govinda Pokharel, a newly appointed head of the Economic Policy and Planning Department of the Congress, told the Post. “However, the two general secretaries cannot accommodate all groups in the party, and hence their difficulties.” According to Pokharel, after becoming the party’s office bearers, they are slowly turning cautious. “Although they have a very popular base and they also have content-based knowledge on development, they are not being able to use their potential.” Sharma differs.“We have challenged the party leadership on many issues to establish our agenda,” Sharma said. “At the party’s Mahasamiti meeting in February, we successfully proposed contesting the upcoming election with the party’s own strength… The party's central committee meeting, which will commence on Wednesday, will pass our proposal as it is.” A Congress leader close to General Secretary Thapa, however, acknowledged that Thapa is sometimes clueless about the party’s functioning.“From the beginning, the general secretaries have not been able to mobilise the leaders in their fold effectively,” Shankar Tiwari, a Congress youth leader close to Thapa, told the Post. “Sometimes they prevail over the party president, but on many other occasions they are also at his mercy.”Meanwhile, a few Congress leaders claim that the popularity of the general secretaries duo is diminishing, which could make it difficult for them to elevate themselves in party politics in the coming days. There are ample examples where Congress leaders lost their revolutionary spirit after becoming general secretary, says the leader.Only three past general secretaries of Congress have succeeded in becoming party chief and the prime minister. Krishna Prasad Bhattarai was the general secretary of the party soon after the establishment of democracy in Nepal in 1950. Likewise, Girija Prasad Koirala, another general secretary during the 1990s, later became the prime minister as well as the party President. Sushil Koirala was the third general secretary to become party president, and the prime minister. Jagat Nepal, a long-time Congress observer, says that apart from the prime minister, two of the Congress’s general secretaries have become the country’s President, if not party president and prime minister. “Ram Baran Yadav, the first President of the country, and Ramchandra Paudel, the current President, both were once the party’s general secretary,” Nepal told the Post. Besides, Taranath Ranabhat, the former general secretary of the party, and Paudel became Speakers of the House of Representatives in the 1990s.Nepal added that despite not being elevated to the party’s top position, a few former general secretaries of Congress had played an important role in national politics. “We can’t draw a sweeping conclusion that leaders lose their influence after becoming general secretary,” he said.Apart from the leaders mentioned above, Mahendra Narayan Nidhi, Krishna Prasad Sitaula, Prakash Man Singh, Sashank Koirala, and Purna Bahadur Khadka were the few among others who took up the responsibility of the general secretary.“As far as why they were not able to lift themselves to the top position is concerned, sometimes, despite their personal efficiency, circumstances might not be favourable,” Dahal, the senior journalist, said.General Secretary Sharma echoes Dahal.In the past, the party president used to nominate one of the two general secretaries. In such a case, the nominated general secretary would obviously not be able to challenge the party chief, Sharma said. From the 14th general convention, the party started to elect both general secretaries through voting by party delegates. \n“Factionalism is unacceptable in our party,” Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, who also chairs the CPN-UML, said at a party meeting on Sunday.Some people might provoke factional feuds on the pretext of strengthening internal democracy in the party, but that is not allowed in the UML, Oli said. “Some of you might take it lightly, arguing that we have heard such dictats since a long time ago,” Oli emphasised. “But it is not something to ignore. It is something to heed seriously.”Oli cautioned the party members against groupism in the party, while administering the oath to the newly appointed vice-chair of the party, Guru Baral, two standing committee members, Mukunda Neupane and Lilanath Shrestha, and 17 central committee members at the party’s central office in Chasyal, Lalitpur on Sunday.Though Chairman Oli ruled against promoting factional activities within the party, some UML leaders accuse him for giving rise to factionalism.It is common practice worldwide to pursue a “two-line struggle” in a communist party. During the party convention, rival leaders often present parallel political documents.While the incumbent party chief presents a political paper, those from the anti-establishment camp float a different paper to counter its ideas. This eventually sets the ground for a two-line struggle in a communist party. Though communists tried to sugarcoat the two-line struggle as a way to rejuvenate party activities and strengthen intra-party democracy, political analysts say such exercise is limited to propping up factions. For Nepali politicians, factions are platforms to exercise power. “When two or more leaders with parallel influential groups exist within the party, that often results in factionalism,” Keshav Dahal, a political analyst, told the Post. “But when there are no leaders to challenge the party’s top leader, there remain fewer chances for groupism.”After a group of UML leaders under former party chiefs Madhav Kumar Nepal and Jhala Nath Khanal split the party to form the CPN (Unified Socialist) in 2021, there was no one to openly challenge Oli. Therefore, the UML doesn’t have a faction now running activities parallel to the party establishment from the centre to the grassroots, which used to be the case in the past.Oli was the one who led a strong faction for many years when Nepal or Khanal was the party chief. Then, why is Oli himself afraid of factional activities in the party?UML leaders say there are no reasons for the party chair to fear from an exercise of intra-party democracy if the top leaders don’t promote factional activities.“It is the duty of the party leader not to engage in factionalism within the party, rather than urging party members not to do so,” Usha Kiran Timilsina, a central committee member of the UML, told the Post. “If the leadership does not promote this, party members will automatically avoid factionalism.”Another UML leader lambasted Oli for being the party's arbitrary leader and a promoter of groupism.A UML standing committee member said the party’s central secretariat meeting on August 1 showed favouritism while deciding a work division among top leaders. He claimed that leaders close to Oli and General Secretary Shankar Pokharel got important responsibilities while others were sidelined.When Prithvi Subba Gurung, the minister for communication and information technology in the Oli Cabinet, is relieved of party responsibilities after becoming minister, Finance Minister Bishnu Paudel of the same Cabinet is given the party’s responsibility as well, the leader told the Post, requesting anonymity.According to the work division decided last week, Paudel still coordinates the monitoring of the party’s organisational activities. Gurung had earlier got the responsibility of leading the party’s parliamentary affairs department. Now Gurung heads no department in the UML.The newly appointed central committee members are loyal to party chair Oli and General Secretary Pokharel, the leader claimed.But Krishna Bhakta Pokharel, who was sworn in as a central member on Sunday, ruled out factionalism in the party. “It was not groupism that party chair Oli pointed to while administering the oath to us,” Pokharel told the Post. “The party chair only tried to make party members aware of the possible foul play against the UML.”Despite being one of the organising members of the 10th general convention of the UML held in Chitwan in November 2021, Pokharel, who earlier was a central committee member and two-time lawmaker, was excluded from the committee.Left-leaning analysts also claim that there is intense rivalry between various groups at the provincial level even if there is no vertical division at present.“But the party is not free from groups exercising parallel activities within the organisation,” Jhalak Subedi, a left-leaning political analyst, told the Post.Political analyst Dahal also claims that even though there are no leaders in UML to challenge the party chair at present, there are struggles between party leaders to project themselves as being close to Oli. The tussle visible among second-rung leaders while picking the chief minister in Lumbini is the latest case in point.When the Congress and the UML decided to form the Lumbini provincial government under the UML’s leadership, many saw UML’s Lumbini Assembly leader Leela Giri as a natural candidate for chief minister.However, Chet Nath Acharya, the deputy leader of the assembly, was appointed the chief minister on July 22. Giri is close to party vice-chair Bishnu Paudel while Acharya is loyal to Pokharel. As General Secretary Pokharel is closer to Oli, the party chief directly instructed Lumbini assembly members of the UML to support Acharya—not Giri. “We are not sure why the party selected Acharya instead of Giri, but we believe it was due to the rivalry between party vice-chair Paudel and General Secretary Pokharel,” a provincial assembly member then told the Post on the condition of anonymity.“Due to the personal rivalry between Paudel and Pokharel, Acharya got the opportunity despite Giri having been considered the chief minister.”During the party's provincial convention held in September last year, Paudel and Pokharel were fiercely engaged in electing leaders loyal to them as the provincial committee chair. The same rivalry was evident while electing the chief minister, according to the leader.Soon after the appointment, Giri had said that if central leaders try to embrace their close supporters while sidelining others, that could sow the seeds of groupism in the party.However, when the Post contacted Giri on Sunday, he refused to comment on the selection of the chief ministerial candidate.Party insiders said that just like the Paudel-Pokharel rivalry in Lumbini, there are similar exercises in other regions as well. For instance, senior leaders Gurung and Khagraj Adhikari are vying for a grip on the party committees in Gandaki Province. \nThe rhythmic beat of the Dha echoes through a Bhaktapur alley, blending with the energetic footsteps of dancers. Bhaktapur, which sees jatras and festivals round the year, is no stranger to music, dance and celebrations. But this is not an ordinary occasion. The performers in question are Lakhe dancers who are reviving the Ranjitkar Lakhe dance after a century.The young dancers are preparing for Indra Jatra this year, where mask-clad Lakhe dancers roam the streets to rid the community of hardships and suffering. Lakhe, demon deities revered as protectors of people and crops, are thought to reside in the demonic mask. As the dancer dons the mask, the spirit is said to take over.Bhaktapur was once a key site for the Ranjitkar Lakhe performances, but the art form vanished from the city after the 1934 earthquake.“Bhaktapur suffered the most damage during the 1934 earthquake,\" says Ganesh Ram Ranjit, treasurer of the Ranjitkar Group’s Bhaktapur branch. “The destruction left residents struggling to recover for a decade, making it nearly impossible to perform the costly Lakhe dance.”The Ranjitkar Group discovered the extinct dance in the year the group was established. They located a Lakhe temple in Bhaktapur that had closed after the earthquake. After two years of research, they learned that performing the Lakhe dance was seen as a good omen in Bhaktapur and involved hosting community feasts. However, the high cost of this tradition forced many to sell their properties, rendering it unfeasible in the city’s post-earthquake conditions. Over time, the dance was abandoned as more lands supporting these cultural events were lost during rapid urbanisation.“There was a significant decline in our engagement with our cultural heritage,” says Rabi Shakya, a sculptor and Lakhe dance teacher training the new dancers. “The encouraging change now is the strong interest from the new generation, which is making it possible to revive intangible heritage like this dance.”After 100 years, the Ranjitkar Lakhe Dance is making a return to Bhaktapur at this year’s Indra Jatra.“It’s challenging to accurately re-enact the dance since it hasn’t been seen in a century,” Shakya notes. “As a sculptor, I drew inspiration from Bhaktapur’s revered Shree Navadurga Bhawani to create the Lakhe’s mask.” Similarly, the dance was choreographed by studying Lakhe dances from Kathmandu, Patan, and Banepa within the Ranjitkar community, and combining them with traditional steps from Bhaktapur Lakhe dances.“As for the musical instruments, we are using traditional instruments like Dha, Dhime, and Ponga, which are said to excite the Lakhe,” says Rajendra Maharjan, Lakhe dance teacher and musician.Maharjan is one of the experienced Newari arts teachers working to revive the lost Lakhe dance. He is involved in training young students in cultural arts and is now dedicated to the Ranjitkar dance training, with the students practising together nearly every day.“Becoming a Lakhe performer involves more than just wearing the costume and mask,” said Sudin Ranjit, a Lakhe dance student. “We must train extensively with our teachers, and it demands a lot of hard work.”To Ranjit, a resident of Bhaktapur, the training is more than learning a new craft; it is a matter of protecting culture. Growing up only interested in instruments, he slowly understood how important continuing cultural practices like Lakhe dances is for their community.“The dance will not only bolster Bhaktapur’s cultural pride but also boost tourism and create jobs,” says Dr Purushottam Lochan Shrestha, a professor and researcher specialising in Bhaktapur and Newari culture.Shrestha notes that reviving the dance would offer employment to everyone involved, from the dancers and the sculptor making the masks to those participating in the rituals. “Economic centres throughout the city, from small businesses to large industries, will benefit from the influx of tourists attracted by the Lakhe dance,” Shrestha adds, commending the Ranjitkar group's initiative.Once the Ranjitkar community revitalises the Lakhe dance, the Ranjitkar group plans to set up a new Guthi house with a fresh community fund and organise annual events for the dance.“The Lakhe dance won’t let them separate,” Shakya remarks.In today’s globalised world, where identity often merges into a homogenised blend, shared cultural practices provide a sense of connection and belonging. This new Lakhe dance embodies that spirit of togetherness for the community involved.“Reviving the dance after 100 years,” Shakya says, “is about preserving our culture for the next 300 years.” \nThe Lions Club of Kathmandu Corporate, Nepal MD325-D has felicitated various personalities as part of its endeavour to recognise the contribution of the individuals and business entities for the society.As part of its campaign, the Lions Club of Kathmandu honoured Prateek Pradhan with Social Journalism Award, Sylapa T Rimponche with Social Spiritual Award, Erika Gurung with Social Player Award, Ramesh Corporation with Social Corporate House Award, Rajendra Malla with Social Corporate Leader Award and Rajesh Hamal with Social Celebrity Award.Likewise, Chandra Ghimire is honoured with Social Bureaucratic Award, Binod Das with Sports Management Award, Anil Kedia with Social Academic Award, Mohan Ojha with Social Management Award and Surya Nepal with Corporate Social Responsibility Award.The Lionism embarked in Nepal in 1971 as the Lions Club of Biratnagar under the stewardship of former Prime Minister Matrika Prasad Koirala.The Lions Clubs International says it has over 2,000 clubs operating across the nation. \nThe government has declared a public holiday in the Kathmandu Valley on Sunday to celebrate the Bhoto Jatra.On the occasion of the festival, a public holiday has been declared in the three districts of Kathmandu Valley [Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur], according to a statement by Narayan Prasad Bhattarai, spokesperson for the Ministry of Home Affairs, on Friday.The government announces a public holiday each year on this occasion.The month-long chariot-pulling festival of Rato Machhindranath concludes with the displaying of a bhoto (a jewel-studded vest) at Jawalakhel, Lalitpur. It is an annual cultural and religious ritual of displaying the black jewel-studded vest believed to be of then Nagraj, the serpent King.Machhindranath is revered as the God of rain, good harvest and prosperity. Paying homage to Lord Machhindranath is believed to bring good luck and fulfil one’s wishes. \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City has resumed pavement widening in the New Road area from Wednesday. Officials at the Public Construction Department under the metropolis said that the contractor resumed the work after the High Court, Patan issued an interim order paving the way for following an interim order from the High Court, Patan allowing the work to proceed. “Now there is no obstruction from locals nor from federal government agencies,” said Baburam Bhattarai, a member of the City Planning Commission under the KMC. “We hope that the project will be completed at the earliest.”The metropolis had awarded a contract to widen the sidewalks by 1.5 metres along both sides of the road section between the New Road gate and the Juddha Statue roundabout in the last fiscal year. The work started in the New Road area in May, but a jurisdictional dispute between the city office and the Road Division, Kathmandu, caused the project to come to a halt. The division confiscated contractors’ equipment, and the federal government deployed police in to prevent the city office from working. Some local residents, too, had demonstrated against the pavement widening plan. The division had even repaired the parts of roads cut for pavement expansion.And on June 9, the metropolis moved the High Court challenging the breach of jurisdiction by the road division, which is a federal agency, and its intervention in the city’s work.City officials were already frustrated by the years-long delay by federal agencies in completing another project, the widening of Kathmandu’s Ring Road in the Kalanki-Maharajgunj section, which has caused huge inconvenience to the public due to dust and mud.Mayor Balendra Shah then directed city officials to dump truckloads of dirt from the Ring Road section in front of the main entrance of the Road Division office at Minbhawan, accusing federal agencies of delaying the work.The 8.2km Kalanki-Maharajgunj section was set to be widened by the Chinese government, and the work was initially planned to start in early 2020, but the project has not progressed even after years due to Covid and delays in clearing the power poles and in some cases structures along the right of way.Regarding the jurisdiction dispute over the sidewalk widening work in the city, a division bench of judges Dhurba Raj Nand and Prakash Kharel at the High Court Patan issued an interim order in favour of the metropolis on Sunday.The City office has already widening pavements by 1 metre on both sides in the Bhrikutimandap area. “Neither did the federal government agency intervene, nor did locals object while expanding pavement in the Bhrikutimandap area by narrowing the road,” said Bhattarai. “Further decisions on pavement widening in other areas like Thamel, Handigaun and others will be taken after collecting public feedback.”Officials said that the long-term plan is to restrict motor vehicles altogether in the New Road area due to heavy pedestrian traffic. “We have also been working to find a solution to the parking problem and weighing various options including setting up multi-storey parking facilities,” said Bhattarai, who is also an urban planner.Officials said that pavements in the New Road area, which always remain crowded, should be widened to ensure free pedestrian movement. Officials claimed that New Road residents have also requested the city office to expand the pavement.According to city officials, local residents have, from time to time, complained about feeling unsafe and experiencing sexual harassment on the narrow and crowded sidewalks. \nLaxmi InterContinental Pvt.

On Monday, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled amid massive anti-government protests.“It’s more than 15 days since cargo trucks from Bangladesh have not moved. The containers ready to be dispatched from Nepal are on hold,” said Rajendra Sangraula, senior vice president of the Nepal Freight Forwarders Association. “There will be cargo movement until the situation returns to normal.”Banglabandha is a major inland port in northern Bangladesh that was established to provide a trade link with Nepal through the Asian highway. The three nations are separated by the Siliguri Corridor, a 52km stretch of Indian territory. Phulbari is on the Indian side of the border.The Siliguri Corridor, also called 'Chicken's Neck,' connects India's northeastern states to the rest of the country. Bangladesh and Nepal lie on either side of the corridor, and Bhutan lies on the northern side.Bilateral trade between Nepal and Bangladesh began to increase after the Kakarbhitta-Phulbari-Banglabandha transit route was opened on August 31, 1997.“We used to receive 20–25 cargo trucks from Bangladesh at normal times,” said Sangraula.Traders said that despite having potential trade opportunities with Bangladesh, exports have remained minimal due to 35 percent import duty levied by the country.Sangraula said Nepal has been majorly importing jute, a raw material for garments, and branded readymade garments like Nike and Adidas, among others.Nepali traders who have already opened Letters of Credit (LC) will have to wait to receive their ordered goods.Sangraula said the domestic industry, which depends on raw materials imported from Bangladesh, will be mostly affected. Producers might also need to look for other markets amid the crisis in Bangladesh. The total trade between Nepal and Bangladesh is Rs4.78 billion. Nepal’s imports from Bangladesh declined by 30.13 percent in the last fiscal year ended on July 15. According to the Department of Customs, Nepal’s imports fell to Rs4.22 billion in the past year.Export, too, declined by 3.37 percent to Rs554.66 million in the review period. Nepal faced a trade deficit of Rs3.67 billion with Bangladesh in the period. Nepal has been facing a trade deficit with Bangladesh since 2014-15.In the last fiscal year, Nepal majorly imported raw jute, medicine, lead-acid accumulators, oil cakes and other solid residues of soybeans, toilet paper, and juice.Sangraula said that, in the long term, the changes in the government system might impact the bilateral agreement, which has been in the works for 15 years. It will also affect the Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Nepal Motor Vehicle Agreements.“If the crisis continues for a long period, it will have repercussions on trade. But as in Sri Lanka, the situation in Bangladesh may eventually get normal,” said Paras Kharel, executive director of the South Asia Watch on Trade, Economics and Environment.A trade expert said that Bangladesh holds a considerable export potential for Nepal, but this has yet to be realised. Currently, Nepal exports most of the lentils it produces to Bangladesh.Kharel said the new government in Bangladesh might not give much importance to BBIN and BIMSTEC. “The trade between two countries might remain the same, with no progress in the coming days.”Kharel said the electricity import might also be on hold for some time, but as it is their need, it will be continued.In June, Bangladesh's Cabinet Committee on Government Purchase approved a proposal by the Bangladesh Power Development Board to import 40 MW of electricity from Nepal.Nepal plans to sell 144,000 MWh (megawatt-hour) of electricity in five months at 6.4 cents (US dollar) a unit.Nepal will transmit the energy to India through the 400KV Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur cross-border transmission line before India transmits the equivalent to Bangladesh. A study conducted by SAWTEE on Nepal-Bangladesh trade shows that Nepal's exports to Bangladesh have been limited to agricultural products, with lentils making up approximately 90 percent of exports over the past five years.As Nepal moves closer to graduating from the Least Developed Country (LDC) status, exploring alternative markets to mitigate the impact of tariff increment in some of its major trade destinations becomes crucial. According to the report, there is substantial potential for strengthening bilateral trade ties with Bangladesh.Experts have said that the proposed preferential trade agreement, which has been discussed since 2019, could remove this constraint, but Bangladesh faces various challenges.This year, too, a commerce secretary-level meeting between Nepal and Bangladesh held in Kathmandu in April to strengthen economic ties could not reach a conclusion on the much-delayed bilateral preferential trade agreement between the two neighbours.Since 2015, Nepal and Bangladesh have been mulling to establish direct bus services between their respective capitals.The distance between Kathmandu and Dhaka is more than 1,184 km, and the bus journey is expected to take 24 hours.The proposed route extends from Dhaka to Banglabandha (510 km), Banglabandha to Kakkarbhitta, Nepal via Panitanki (56 km) and Kakkarbhitta to Kathmandu (618 km). The trip from Kakkarbhitta to Kathmandu takes around 11 hours. \nFor the past five days, every TV screen in Nepal has been displaying a message: Dear customers, due to a sudden and unforeseen problem with the channel distributor, international channels like Sony, Star, Zee, and Icast are currently unavailable.” Cable and internet TV operators have apologised for the disruption and assured that they would resolve the matter. Consumer rights activists say that consumers are being cheated under various pretexts.Nepali operators say that delays in approving the à la carte pricing guidelines by the Finance Ministry led the Indian broadcaster to cut some channels from cable and internet TV services last Thursday evening. “As the dues piled up due to the delays by the government in giving approval to the pricing guidelines, the Indian Broadcasting and Digital Foundation decided to cut channel services in Nepal,” said Sudhir Parajuli, president of the Federation of Nepal Cable Television Association.The Indian Broadcasting and Digital Foundation is a unified representative body of TV broadcasters and over-the-top platforms in India. Over-the-top platforms are streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, among others, that deliver content over the internet directly to viewers.Before the à la carte system, broadcasters and distributors would reach an agreement and sign a contract that included pricing details, said Parajuli. “With the implementation of the à la carte system, new pricing guidelines were required.”In August last year, the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology formally implemented the “pick-and-pay” option for Nepali television viewers.“Since the Indian broadcasters were initially not ready to adopt the à la carte system, we were also in a dilemma. Eventually, the government strictly enforced the system.”The Ministry of Communications then prepared and sent the tariff guidelines to the Ministry of Finance. “It took a while for the Ministry of Finance to give its approval,” said Parajuli.The Ministry of Finance finally gave its approval to the guidelines last Thursday and sent them to the Ministry of Communications, said Parajuli.“The distributors have not been able to pay the Indian broadcasters for the last 14 months. The outstanding dues amount to Rs500 million,” Parajuli said. The Ministry of Communications could not issue foreign exchange recommendations for distributors to pay their Indian vendors because the guidelines had been stalled.“Now that the guidelines have been approved, services will resume within a few days,” Parajuli said.Government officials claimed they were unaware of the issue.The secretary at the Ministry of Communications, Radhika Aryal, said she was unaware of the issue because she had been newly appointed to the ministry.The Post's multiple attempts to reach the ministry spokesperson Gajendra Thakur were unsuccessful.Officials from the Department of Information and Broadcasting, also said they were unaware of the issue.The à la carte system allows viewers to choose and pay only for the channels they want to watch. This allows viewers to watch their favourite channels and pay only for those, rather than the whole package that includes channels they rarely watch. The Ministry of Communications has fixed a minimum monthly fee of Rs250 per customer for cable television to cover carrying costs.This model is used in countries like India, the United States, and Canada.According to the federation, there are eight cable TV operators, including internet TV providers in Nepal. Around 110 Nepali channels and 98 foreign channels are broadcast in Nepal, serving around 1.5 million subscribers who have renewed their subscriptions. Service providers pay monthly fees to both the distributor and to the Indian broadcasters. “We have been paying the distributor every month, but the distributor has not received foreign exchange approvals from the Ministry of Communications,” said Parajuli.According to the federation, the Indian broadcaster has suspended all packages from Zee, Sony, Colours, and Star across the country. If some customers still have access to these channels, then it must be pirated.Currently, TV channels in Nepal are broadcast through direct-to-home, multiple-system operators, multichannel multipoint distribution services, internet protocol television, and digital terrestrial television, among other methods.“Customers pay in advance for cable TV services, but the service has been interrupted for five days, and there is no sign of resumption. This is a total scam,” said Prem Lal Maharjan, president of the National Consumers Forum.“Who is responsible for this, and who will compensate for this?” He demanded that the service providers compensate the customers for the disruption. \nIn a bid to address growing mental health problems in children and adolescents, the Ministry of Health and Population has decided to train health workers to examine their mental health conditions.Officials said that as many as 150 health workers, including medical officers, nurses and paramedics, will be trained to screen the mental health conditions of this age group within the current fiscal year.“We hope that the health worker training programme will help lessen existing mental health problems in children and adolescents,” said Dr Pomawati Thapa, chief of the Non-communicable Disease and Mental Health Section at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Those serving in primary health care centres will be trained first so that children and adolescents from villages will get access to the services easily.”A report of the National Mental Health Survey Nepal-2020 shows that the prevalence of mental disorders among adolescents was 5.2 percent that year, and the neurotic and stress-related disorders were the most prevalent at 2.8 percent.Likewise, the prevalence of current suicidal thoughts among adolescents was around four percent, while suicidal attempt in the same age group was 0.7 percent. The same report also shows that 0.6 percent of children and adolescents were found to have been suffering from depression.The prevalence of suicidality, including current suicidal thoughts, lifetime suicidal attempts and future likelihood of suicidal thoughts, was found to be prevalent in the 7.2 percent population.Experts say that mental health problems in children and adolescents could be several times more than what the survey portrays. They say that around 10 to 15 percent of the total children and adolescent population could have been suffering from various types of mental health issues, and due to methodological problems, the survey could not portray actual problems.“Children and adolescents could suffer from various types of mental health problems, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, depression, conduct disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder,” said Dr Arun Kunwar, child and adolescent psychiatrist. “But very few parents and teachers realise the problems and seek medical attention. Children get scolded and beaten both at schools and at home.”A study carried out by the Nepal Health Research Council in the past shows that about 13 percent of Nepalis suffer from some form of mental disorder. This means around one in eight Nepalis have mental health issues. Moreover, the country simply does not have enough experts to treat mental health problems, it added.Health officials said that there are only around half a dozen child and adolescent psychiatric doctors in the country, and only a few are serving in state-run health facilities. Similarly, the major contributors to the treatment gap are societal beliefs, traditions and stigma associated with mental disorders, according to experts.“This training will help health workers notice problems and refer patients to health facilities with child psychiatrists and psychologists,” said Thapa.Studies show the magnitude of suffering, the burden and costs for individuals, families and societies arising from mental health disorders are alarming in Nepal.The World Health Organisation says that one in four people in the world has been affected by mental or neurological disorders at some point in their lives, and around 450 million people currently suffer from such conditions, placing mental disorders among the leading causes of ill health and disability worldwide. \nA bi-weekly situation update published by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division on Monday shows one death from the dengue disease and over 300 positive cases. Since the start of this year, the number of people infected with the virus has reached 2,365.Public health experts warn that the death toll and case numbers could go up further in the coming days. They criticise the authorities for their narrow approach—focussing solely on counting cases and deaths, which does little to control the outbreak of the deadly disease.“The authorities have neither conducted risk mapping nor taken measures to lessen the spread of the deadly virus,” said Dr Baburam Marasini, former director at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Counting cases and deaths is not enough. Even the reported figures are far from reflecting the actual scale of the outbreak.”Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika, according to the World Health Organisation.“Dengue virus is not like the coronavirus, which spread all over the world suddenly,” said Dr Biraj Karmacharya, an infectious disease expert who is also the administrative head of Dhulikhel Hospital. “We can use the existing data for risk mapping, step up surveillance, and predict disease outbreaks accordingly.”Experts say the disease will not stop spreading unless the lessons and experiences gained in previous outbreaks are implemented. They say the real number of infections could be several times higher, as the government’s case reporting system is not very effective, and more than 80 percent of the cases are asymptomatic.Even symptomatic patients do not seek treatment at the hospital unless their symptoms get severe. What concerns them much is that many patients take non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs—Flexon tablets, Nims, and Rynex, among others—to cure body aches caused by the dengue infection. Using such drugs is very risky during dengue infection.Doctors warn that using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to treat dengue can increase the risk of internal bleeding, including in the eyes, elevate enzyme levels and damage the liver.Some patients who use NSAIDs in excess also suffer internal bleeding. Such patients need to transfuse platelet-rich plasma and platelet concentrate, according to them.Health agencies concerned have been shifting responsibilities to other agencies that are ill-equipped and lacking in both financial and human resources.“Every day, 16 to 17 people in our district get infected with the dengue virus,” said Dr Arjun Sapkota, chief of the Health Office, Kathmandu. Health agencies at the local level have been asked to launch a dengue search and destroy campaign and ramp up awareness about the risks.”Experts say most local units lack the budget and human resources to launch preventive measures. They say that a massive awareness campaign is instrumental in destroying the breeding ground of the dengue-spreading vector, and the public must be made aware of the treatment.Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms, which do not need any treatment or can be treated with paracetamol at home. Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects such as plastic cups and bottles could be breeding grounds for dengue-carrying mosquitoes.According to doctors, mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache and pain in the eyes are some of the symptoms of dengue. Doctors advise that those with these symptoms should seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and access to proper medical care can lower fatalities.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district. Since then, an increasing number of dengue infections, including major outbreaks, have been reported from many districts. At least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts in 2023.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Though the post-monsoon period is considered the dengue epidemic season, the deadly disease has already become endemic in Nepal, as outbreaks are reported every month, including in the winter months. \nEpidemiology and Disease Control Division (EDCD) under the Department of Health Services informed that one person died of dengue infection in Tanahun.2,365 people have been infected across the country since December last year. Dengue infection has spread to 73 districts. 537 people have been infected in Koshi Province, 46 in Madhes, 747 in Bagmati, 508 in Gandaki, 247 in Lumbini, 38 in Karnali and 242 in SudurPaschim.With the arrival of the monsoon, dengue cases have spiked in Kathmandu Valley.287 people have been infected in Kathmandu Valley, 137 in Kaski, 133 in Jhapa, 116 in Chitwan and 110 in Tanahun.Similarly, cases of cholera infections have been increasing. According to the EDCD, cholera has been confirmed in 30 people across the country with no casualties so far. \nAmid monsoon rains causing widespread death and destruction, the risk of infection of water- and vector-borne diseases intensifies.Officials at the Ministry of Health and Population are bracing for tough days ahead, as the escalating monsoon not only pollutes sources of drinking water but also provides breeding grounds for various disease-spreading vectors.“Over 2,000 people from 73 districts have already tested positive for the dengue virus and several districts have witnessed outbreaks of waterborne diseases, including cholera,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “We are aware of the possible risks and have alerted the relevant agencies.”The division said that 23 cholera cases have already been confirmed in Lalitpur, Kailali and Kathmandu districts. Likewise, as many as 2,061 people from 73 districts have tested positive for dengue. Health facilities across the country have been grappling with a surge in water- and vector-borne diseases. “Infection of the dengue virus has not risen this time compared to the previous years,” said Ghimire. “Ongoing rain has contaminated drinking water sources which increases the risk of potential outbreaks of waterborne diseases in the coming days.”According to data provided by the division, among the 73 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases at 249, followed by Jhapa 130, Chitwan 105, Tanahun 87, Makawanpur 78, Kaski 74, Bhojpur 62, Kavrepalanchok 60, and Okhaldhunga with 59 cases.Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika, according to the World Health Organisation.Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. Likewise, cholera is a highly infectious disease that causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting, which in turn results in dehydration and can lead to death within a few hours if left untreated. The World Health Organisation says cholera is a global threat to public health and an indicator of inequality and a lack of social development.Health officials said that the Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool samples of the infected patients. They concede that the outbreaks of the deadly disease are being reported only from the districts having active case surveillance programmes. Active cholera surveillance is being carried out from 27 health facilities in Kathmandu Valley and 10 in Kailali district.The monsoon season in Nepal is a time of epidemics during which thousands of people across the country become infected with waterborne and vector-borne diseases. Officials warned that health facilities could witness an uptick in the number of viral fever cases, and waterborne diseases—diarrhoea, dysentery, food poisoning, and snakebites—in the coming days.The Ministry of Health and Population last month urged provincial and local health authorities not to grant leave to health workers during the monsoon season and step up vigilance about the potential risks.Officials say that they have been raising awareness through all available means to inform people of the risks and directed agencies concerned to stockpile essential medicines.Doctors say the only ways to prevent deaths from waterborne diseases, including diarrhoea, are to raise awareness and ensure safe drinking water.They say a combination of careful surveys, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation and treatment are required to contain the spread of the diarrhoeal infection. \nAt least 20 diarrhoeal patients—12 from Lalitpur, eight from Kailali and two from Kathmandu—were found to have contracted cholera recently. People residing in other districts may have also been infected with the deadly disease, but due to absence of an active cholera surveillance programme in most of the districts, no one knows what is going on.“Active cholera surveillance is being carried out only in the three districts of the Valley—Kathmandu, Lalitpur and Bhaktapur—and in Kailali,” said Dr Hemanta Chandra Ojha, an official at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “We have a system in place in other districts as well but intensive surveillance is being carried out in Kathmandu Valley and in Kailali only.”Cholera is a highly infectious disease that causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting, which in turn results in dehydration and can lead to death within a few hours if left untreated. The World Health Organisation says cholera is a global threat to public health and an indicator of inequality and a lack of social development.Health officials said that the Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool samples of the infected patients. They concede that the outbreaks of the deadly disease are being reported from the districts having active case surveillance programmes. Active cholera surveillance is being carried out from 27 health facilities in the Valley and 10 in Kailali district.“Report of cholera outbreak in districts having intensive cholera surveillance is an obvious thing, as we carry out testing only when we find problems,” said an official at the Department of Health Services, asking not to be named as he is not authorised to talk to the media. “We will not know anything about the cause of disease outbreaks, if we stopped testing.”Officials at the Ministry of Health and Population, however, claimed that even if active cholera surveillance programmes are not in place in most of the districts, systems are in place to collect stool samples of the diarrhoeal patients and send them for lab testing if needed.“We have provincial public health laboratories in all provinces that can carry out cholera testing, and we also bring samples to the National Public Health Laboratory for examination when a massive diarrheal outbreak occurs,” said Ojha of the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “We have an Integrated Health Information Management System and Early Warning, Alert and Response System, which reports about the disease outbreaks. Active surveillance is being carried out only in high risk districts.”Officials, who wish not to be quoted in news as they fear retribution for speaking to the media, however, said that Integrated Health Information Management System only provides monthly reports; moreover, the system provides only clinical reports, not the reports of lab testing. The Early Warning, Alert and Response System is also not very effective.“The thing is systems on which health authorities rely much do not give an exact picture of the disease outbreak, and such systems do not help contain massive outbreaks,” the official said. “Major outbreaks of waterborne disease could happen at any time and at any place, and authorities concerned get alerted only after loss.”Health officials concede that it is not the government that is carrying out active surveillance of the deadly disease in four districts but the International Vaccine Institute, Korea. When asked why the government does not think it necessary to carry out active cholera surveillance in other districts, they said that the existing health budget is insufficient for the task.Cholera outbreaks during the monsoon season are not a new thing in Nepal, as hundreds of people throughout the country suffer from diarrhoeal infections that continue for months every year and scores contract the disease.In 2022, a total of 77 cholera cases were confirmed in the Valley. Last year, health authorities administered an oral cholera vaccine in Kathmandu Metropolitan City’s wards 11, 12, and 13, which were highly affected by the outbreak.Public health experts say that due to poor sanitation and hygiene conditions, the country as a whole is highly vulnerable to water-borne illnesses including diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid, hepatitis, and cholera, with thousands of people getting infected every year.They say sheer negligence from authorities concerned is responsible for ongoing outbreak of diarrhoeal diseases including the deadly cholera.Health authorities in most local units had stopped the testing of drinking water just before the start of the monsoon season, citing lack of funds, although deadly microbes such as faecal coliform and E coli were frequently detected in drinking water samples.Faecal coliform and E coli, both microscopic organisms, are found in human faeces. According to doctors, the presence of faecal coliform and E coli in drinking water means it is contaminated with sewage.Doctors say bottled water, which is widely used by households and offices in Kathmandu Valley, is generally considered safe, but water quality of several companies have been found questionable. Dangerous microbes are detected in bottled water every year, which means not all jar water brands are safe to drink without treatment.Doctors have asked authorities to launch awareness drives against water-borne diseases and ensure safe drinking water to prevent deaths from illnesses like cholera.To contain the spread of the infection, a combination of careful surveys, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation, and treatment is required, according to doctors.The World Health Organisation also said that a multifaceted approach is key to controlling cholera and reducing deaths. \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar. \nThe noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built. Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nNational Women’s Open Taekwondo Competition is set to take place from August 8.The fourth edition of the competition, organised by Nepal Taekwondo Association, will run until August 10 at Nepal Taekwondo Association’s central taekwondo hall in Satdobato, Lalitpur.The tournament will feature participants from all three departmental teams—Tribhuvan Army Club, Nepal Police Club and Nepal Armed Police Force Club, and seven provinces, according to the organisers.A total of 455 players will compete for 52 gold medals in the competition, which will see the martial artists contest in gyarogi and poomsae events. \nNepal national women’s volleyball team stormed into the final of the CAVA Women’s Volleyball Nations League after they defeated Iran in straight sets of 25-21, 28-26, 25-20 at the National Sports Council covered hall in Kathmandu on Tuesday.Up next for Nepal is a blockbuster final against their South Asian rivals India, which is scheduled for Wednesday.India beat Sri Lanka 25-15, 25-16, 25-23 earlier in the afternoon.The win also helped Nepal exact revenge on the Iranians who had defeated the hosts 25-16, 16-25, 25-23, 15-25, 15-13 in the group stage, with the loss costing Nepal a top-placed finish in the league.But, on Tuesday, Nepal were more disciplined and technically better although they had to survive a scare from Iran in the second set.Iran started the first set brightly taking a 5-1 lead but Nepal recovered to level the set 6-6 and never looked back, winning 25-21.The second set was a more thrilling contest.Nepal were ahead by 13-7 at one point but a lack of coordination and communication between the players soon left them reeling behind at 24-21. But Aruna Shahi’s team showed a significant revival to hold Iran to 24-24, with Usha Bhandari winning three points in a row. Iran earned the match points two more times but captain Shahi used her decade-long experience and wit before Niruta Thagunna capped off a brilliant Nepal comeback with a rock-solid spike.Having gained a 2-0 advantage, Nepal then won the third set, which also went neck-to-neck most of the time, to set up a mouth-watering final against India.It was also Nepal’s first ever victory over Iran in women’s volleyball.“It is a very happy moment for us,” said Nepal coach Jagadhish Bhatta during the presentation.“Iran are technically sound. But our players were more motivated. Nepal had committed several mistakes against Iran in the previous game (group stage). Today our team corrected them,” he added.“Obviously, our team made some mistakes against Iran (in the semi-final)…. but they were more cautious in the crucial moments.” Nepal will head into the final with full of confidence having beaten them 25-18, 12-25, 25-17, 18-25, 15-13 for a historic win.Bhatta was confident Nepal will repeat the feat again.“I believe in my team. I believe that Nepal will defeat India and win the trophy,” Bhatta added.Niruta Thagunna said Nepal will give their best in the final against India, once again.“We have already defeated India once in this tournament. But we still have weaknesses to work on. We are ready for India,” said Thagunna, who had been one of the most outstanding players this season. \nJuddha Shumsher's private zoo, built in 1932, housed various animals including elephants, horses, deer, monkeys, tigers, rhinoceroses, clouded leopards, red pandas, bears, palm civets, four-horned antelopes, Himalayan gorals, pheasants, Himalayan monals, a gharial crocodile, a porcupine, and even a lion.\nNepal's book market is plagued by unauthorized translations of popular international works by authors like Taslima Nasrin, Steve Jobs, and Robert Kiyosaki, despite copyright laws prohibiting such practices.\nBharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality’s ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via ‘tallo bato’—backdoor route—and that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal. \nParliaments, such as the UK and Nepal, oversee legislation through post-legislative scrutiny (PLS), ensuring laws meet their intended objectives and holding governments accountable.\nClimate change disproportionately affects vulnerable populations, highlighting the need for climate justice, as exemplified by Nepal's advocacy for international support and recognition of mountain-climate linkages.\nThe Gurung villagers, including some women, assaulted a Dalit man and his mother at their home in the Gurkha village of Lwang, Machhapuchhre Rural Municipality, Kaski, on Friday night. They also broke windows and shouted casteist slurs as well as demeaning remarks. The Dalit victims survived the unprovoked attack, but the single mother required treatment in intensive care at a hospital in Pokhara. Someone bravely took a video of the brutality on their mobile and uploaded it to a YouTube channel. That’s how the terrible crime came to public notice. I learnt from both the video reporting and community members that the local police have refused to register the case as an attempted murder motivated by caste hatred. The local authorities have bent on protecting the accused, their caste fellows, from legal action. This case shows how Dalits continue to suffer mental and physical violence at the hands of ethnic or tribal groups as well. Upper castes are generally blamed for committing crimes against Dalits, but it is not exclusive to them. I suggest that the incident can also be a window into the rather perplexing question of why ethnic groups like the Gurung, Magar, Rai and Limbu continue to segregate and dominate Dalits, even though their movements have vociferously denounced caste hierarchy and distanced themselves from Hindu customs and cultures for decades.Criminals of historyIn a recent Kathmandu gathering hosted by the newly established “Front for Identity” (opened two months ago under the leadership of Mahendra Lawoti, professor of political science at Western Michigan University, USA), Gopal Kirati, veteran leader of ethnic communities and former minister from the Maoist party, made an interesting self-reflexive remark. He said, “I’m a criminal of history. Growing up, I learnt nothing from this society and culture except how to treat Dalits worse than animals.” I wish more ethnic leaders and activists came forward like Kirati and acknowledged their and their communities’ ill-treatment of those considered lower or less pure than themselves. The fact that they continue to humiliate and attack Dalits even now should deeply concern them. It’s also time they realised their grave mistake of excluding Dalits from their movements, which peaked in the late 1990s and included them in their fight against Brahmanism. Dalits themselves recognise many differences between their issues and those of ethnic minorities; however, in reality, there are many overlaps. For one thing, in the eyes of the so-called high-caste Hindu, even ethnic minorities are low-caste Shudra; they, too, are denied the sacred thread and treated as untouchable. Upper castes, mainly orthodox Hindus, don’t accept rice prepared by members of ethnic communities. High castes wouldn’t normally marry ethnic minorities, and even if they did, the latter would face certain restrictions, mainly in the religious and spiritual sphere. An ethnic woman married to an upper caste may be barred from worshipping the lineage deities, for example.Not to mention, thanks to the extensive Hinduisation of ethnic groups over the years, there’s a degree of caste hierarchy practised within and amongst those communities as well. The Gurung wouldn’t marry a Tamang, for example, as the latter has been placed only slightly above the Dalit on the scale of ritual pollution. If the ethnic activists had brought Dalits on board—or at least forged a strong alliance with them—their movements would have become larger and stronger. In the meantime, their populace would probably have been educated about the fallacy and inhumanity associated with the Dalit exclusion. Members of ethnic communities would have learnt that the rejection of caste hierarchy also implies the termination of ritual hierarchy altogether. Thus, the behaviour of these ethnic groups towards Dalits would have hopefully changed quite drastically by now. Ethnic leaders and activists not only excluded Dalits from their movements but also didn’t talk about ending untouchability. They were keen on toppling the Bahun hegemony and separating and suppressing the Dalits. This has been a big failure of ethnic and indigenous identity politics so far. Proponents of ethnic identity should now see this drawback, as Gopal Kiranti seems to have done, and try to bring Dalits along with them. The Front for Identity, led by Prof Lawoti, appears keen to move in this direction. Identity: Horizontal versus vertical In a highly caste-ridden society like ours, the issues of collective identity and individual freedom seem conflicting. Ethnic politics does reify and solidify group boundaries. Ethnic groups are eager to highlight and bolster those inter-group boundaries, whereas Dalits want to dissolve those boundaries once and for all. How do we conceptually overcome this apparent mismatch?Notably, ethnic groups are horizontally arranged—long-term Hinduisation and caste-ification notwithstanding. They are culturally separate but, by and large, equal in status hierarchy. There’s much equality in how these groups interact with each other. Ethnic activists are keen to preserve and promote this horizontal separation.This doesn’t necessarily hurt Dalits’ quest for equality because they want to dismantle the vertical hierarchy and arrange themselves horizontally. They don’t want the statuses to be conceived as big and small, high and low, top and bottom, pure and impure. This explains why many Dalits hate the caste system while loving their caste identities. Dalit caste associations aren’t as big and influential as ethnic associations, yet they have been an important part of the Dalit movement for decades.Once people understand the difference between these two sets of identities arranged horizontally and vertically, the ethnic and Dalit movements can coalesce. This way, ethnic and Dalit campaigners can find common ground and struggle together. This should be the new way forward to accelerate societal change. The recent case of caste violence sheds light on the fact that caste discrimination is rampant within ethnic minority communities, too. They may resent the Hindu social hierarchy in terms of Bahun supremacy, but they are eager to continue suppressing Dalits. My past research and experience show that ethnic communities have played a big role in dominating Dalits, sometimes worse than upper castes! Things should change now, and activists from the new generation must be the active agents of that important change. If you really want to shake the social structure, don’t just fix the ones above you. Consider the plight of those below you. It’s basically the same principle and practice. If you want to challenge Brahmanic supremacy, get rid of your own supremacy as well. Charity begins at home, and so does change!  \nNepal's political instability leads to frequent changes in ambassadors (19 recently appointed), with negative consequences for the country's image and diplomacy, especially in international relations with India, China, and the US.\nNepal's major political parties, despite earlier alliances, have committed to contesting the 2027 general elections independently to test their popularity and adapt to informed electorate choices.\nTwo buses were swept away by the Trishuli River on July 12, highlighting the need for improved disaster preparedness and search and rescue capabilities in Nepal.\nUrban river encroachment and mismanagement have resulted in water pollution, degradation, and the threat of river loss, highlighting the need for a holistic approach incorporating natural and social science knowledge to protect rivers as vital arteries for life.\nWithin days of CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli and Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba reaching a deal to form a new government under Oli’s leadership, some Congress leaders including the two party general secretaries started doubting the deal’s implementation. Independent observers also have doubts over the longevity of the Congress-UML partnership. To get some insight, the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Congress Central Committee member Govind Raj Pokharel, who is also former vice-chair of National Planning Commission. Many have expressed doubt over the longevity of the Congress-UML alliance. What is your observation?There was a discussion in the political circles on the need for the Congress and the UML joining hands to address some serious problems the country has been facing for years. The issues of governance, flaws seen in the practice of the electoral system, and the national economy are some pressing issues that need to be addressed. In the meantime, the top leaders of the two largest parties reached a deal overnight. The dramatic turn of events made people suspect some unspoken reasons had brought the leaders of the two rival forces together. The leaders have stated that they joined hands mainly to review the constitution, to make changes in the electoral system, improve governance and address problems seen in the economic sector. These are the stated objectives. As far as my observation goes, people don’t have full faith in the leaders of the two parties because of past records. On the economic front, this coalition may achieve some improvements because both parties are on the same page. Both follow liberal economic ideas. Of late, even the UML has become increasingly liberal on economic issues. The private sector has welcomed the new alliance. There are already some signs of reforms. Their plan to make changes in the electoral system through constitutional amendment however is not easy. First, their numerical strength in the federal parliament, mainly in the upper house, is insufficient to amend the constitution. Such a move would be risky from a strategic perspective as well. Many groups and forces have reservations over various provisions of this constitution. Once they start the amendment process, it will be like opening Pandora’s Box. Thus I am optimistic only on the economic front. If they get that right, it will help address the society’s mass frustration.The two parties have cited the perennial political instability as a major reason behind their coming together. Can we now expect policy consistency as well?Political instability is an excuse to cover up their failures. Even the alliance of largest parties cannot guarantee political or policy stability. Numbers alone are not enough. Leaders also need to have a democratic culture and the capacity to manage emerging issues. Even governments led by a single party commanding up to two-thirds majority have failed. On certain occasions, coalition governments have done commendable jobs. Handling the post-quake situation and producing the constitution in 2015 were examples of big parties justifying their coalition. Thus even with some doubt, we can expect political stability and some economic reforms.The Congress unanimously endorsed the deal of party president Sher Bahadur Deuba and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli. But in public, leaders from the anti-establishment faction of the Congress don’t seem satisfied. Why this unease?The deal was made in a dramatic way without proper consultations with other leaders. At least those in the executive committees of the party should have been consulted. It is challenging for the Congress leaders to ally with their major rival, the UML. A cadre-based party, the UML’s style of governance is different to that of the Congress. When in government, the UML treats even government institutions, constitutional bodies and independent agencies as the party’s structures. Whereas the Congress allows more freedom to government agencies. So, there is a risk of the UML misusing state mechanisms while the Congress leaders are in the Cabinet. This is one big risk for the Congress. The second concern is the working style of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli. He is a towering personality, a hard-working leader, and with his strong command over his party organisation, he can swiftly implement any proposal. The Congress ministers who also have to listen to the concerns of the party’s top leaders may struggle to strike a balance. In Oli’s Cabinet, ministers are likely to get less freedom within their ministries. A rift is thus likely because of Prime Minister Oli’s working style.Why didn’t the Congress then send influential leaders to the Cabinet to check the prime minister?The leaders might not have been so interested in joining this government. They might have sensed intervention from the prime minister’s office and thought they might not be able to perform as per their expectation under Oli’s leadership. See, chiefs of the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre work in a dictatorial way. Once they are elected at the party convention for four years, they behave like dictators. They take decisions on their own without any consultations. People in Nepal often lobby for a directly-elected prime minister or President. I wonder what these leaders would do if they were directly elected as executive head. So, the problem is in the working style and attitude of our leaders, not in the constitution or the electoral system.Shekhar Koirala and Gagan Thapa had first pitched for joining hands with the UML to end ‘unnecessary bargaining’ of fringe parties. Suddenly, Deuba struck the deal with Oli. And, now Koirala and Thapa seem sceptical about the deal.The proposal of Koirala and Thapa was for Congress leading the government and the UML supporting it. In fact, Oli was ready to accept Congress leadership. He requested the Congress leaders to take the lead. Surprisingly, the negotiating team led by our party president reached an opposite deal. They offered government leadership to Oli.Then, could it be that, as some claim, Deuba and his wife Arzu were desperate to unseat Dahal fearing they could be dragged into corruption scams?I don’t know much about that scenario. But what I knew is that Oli was willing to join a Congress-led government.Why would Deuba, who is a very clever leader in making such give-and-take deals, have given up a chance to be prime minister right away?It’s true that all three party chiefs—Deuba, Oli and Dahal—are very clever in making deals in their own favour based on their numerical strength. A leader beats the other two on one occasion and on another, another of them comes out on top. It’s like a see-saw. This time Oli won the game.Congress General Secretaries Gagan Thapa and Bishwa Prakash Sharma have expressed suspicion over the implementation of the deal. Many say they did so as Deuba didn’t involve them in negotiations on power-sharing. Is it true?The party’s central work execution committee endorsed the deal signed by the two leaders. The leaders who participate in such meetings should speak up then and there if there is anything objectionable, instead of making such statements in public. Why didn’t they oppose it at the meeting? I don’t see any point in expressing doubt over the deal in public while endorsing the same in party committees.The two general secretaries also expressed doubt over Oli handing over government leadership to Deuba as per the agreement. Why this mistrust?The experience of the past two or three decades makes politicians suspicious of each other. Nepali politicians have hardly ever handed over government leadership easily. After four or five months of collaboration, some issues emerge and a rift is created. So, history makes us doubt that this coalition will last for three and half years. In the meantime, the party establishments have sidelined other factions when it comes to picking ministers, both at federal and provincial levels. When the government fails to perform as per expectation, party cadres of the ruling parties start criticising the government. Is it possible to amend the constitution as the two parties have announced?We can’t backtrack on the inclusive system. We must abide by the policy of inclusion in state agencies. The leaders who spoiled this system are saying that the proportional representation (PR) system is not working. But there is room to make our three-tier federal system more cost-effective. People get irritated when they see a large number of representatives benefitting from state coffers. We can bring down the number of local units from 753 to around 400. However, there should be sufficient wards as those units are directly involved in service delivery while the Palikas are more engaged in development activities. The number of ward members can also be decreased. In provinces, we don’t need PR seats as those elected from the provincial constituencies automatically represent the local communities. Likewise, the provincial cabinets can be downsized. Thus we can downsize the number of people who benefit from state coffers. This is vital to make the federal system sustainable. Similarly, we can rightsize the number of PR seats by adopting a rotational constituency for women, dalits and other marginalised communities. Only the candidates from underrepresented sections will compete in those constituencies. This will help elect competent people even from within the targeted communities. This is how we can address some concerns without compromising the inclusive system envisioned in the constitution.Why has the Congress picked gangsters and tainted individuals as ministers in provinces?The selection of such controversial individuals as ministers and policy makers will damage the party’s image. People are going to raise this issue seriously. In fact the pace of criminalisation and commercialisation of Nepali politics is faster than the political reform being undertaken to clean up politics.It seems intellectual leaders are being sidelined while gangsters are being promoted. Why is it happening?Because people from intellectual or political backgrounds voice critical views and leaders don’t like it. They speak what their conscience says is right. For instance, leaders like Mahesh Acharya and Minendra Rijal aren’t given any role in the party. It is a common problem in all the major political forces in Nepal.Is the space for leaders with intellectual backgrounds and having critical views being squeezed?The Congress used to be a very liberal organisation. But it has also become illiberal and leaders have become increasingly intolerant. All leaders—whether the seniors or young ones—are becoming less tolerant even of constructive criticism. Party leaders haven’t spoken against the selection of gangsters as ministers. Even the office bearers who are in decision making bodies and can change the decisions are silent now. This is dangerous. This is an example of how critical voices are sidelined.Haven’t the two young general secretaries been able to raise hope in the Congress?They are working like central committee members. General secretaries should be able to intervene while making crucial policy decisions. They can stop the party committees from making wrong decisions. But they are risk-averse. They are not taking the risk to fight the powerful party establishment.Historically, in all parties there is a trend of its anti-establishment faction bargaining for 40-45 percent seats in the party or government. If they don’t get an acceptable power sharing deal, they don’t cooperate with the party leadership. Is it a healthy democratic practice?Intra-party competition compels the leaders to do this. The ruthless establishment always sidelines party members and leaders if they aren’t loyal. So, the leadership of the anti-establishment has to protect such cadres because the rival factor too needs a strong support base of cadres to compete against the powerful establishment. Party establishments are strong due to centralised resources and other factors, so you need an equally strong force to compete against them. \nScores of people have been killed in landslides, floods and other monsoon-induced disasters within a month of the monsoon entering Nepal in the second week of June. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asks Jagadishwor Karmacharya, director general of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, what the department is doing to save people from disasters and whether our system is ready to cope with the challenges posed by climate change.Where is Nepal in terms of technology and expertise when it comes to forecasting the ever-changing weather patterns?If we compare to our situation a decade ago, we have made significant progress in setting up meteorological stations, collecting real-time data and increasing the frequency of weather predictions. We get rainfall data from around 350 stations, while we receive information about temperature and other related parameters from around 150 stations. We have an additional 175 centres to collect information about water levels. Our servers get real-time data every 10 minutes from all these stations. Besides that, we also have manual data collection centres. Thus, we have around 800 data collection centres in total. But we haven’t been able to set up enough stations in the Himalayan range due to difficult topography, low presence of government agencies and other factors. Also, we release radiosonde balloons to collect data on temperature, humidity and wind speed from the upper levels of the atmosphere. Overall, we have made huge strides in using technologies in the past decade, but it is still insufficient to cater to people’s expectations. They want specific weather information about their present location or destination. The expectation is valid. But our complex and diverse topography and meteorological phenomenon—ranging from the Tarai belt to the Himalayan range—makes accurate forecasts challenging. Kaski’s Lumle sees maximum rainfall in the country, and around 40 km north of it, the Jomsom area sees negligible rain. So great variability within a short distance adds to the challenge of forecasting.Do we have sufficient stations to cater to that variability?We need more stations because the higher you go, the more variabilities you find. In the plains, the weather pattern is more homogenous, while it is highly heterogeneous in the hills. In Tarai, even a station in around 100-150 kilometres may work because there is less variability of temperature as well as rainfall. But we need more stations in the hills where rain patterns drastically change.Are our methods and technologies being updated over time?Until around a decade ago, the forecasters used to predict based on their experience and the data received every three hours from the synoptic weather stations of Nepal and other neighbouring countries. At the time, we used to predict weather only for a day. Now, we synthesise the data collected from our systems and those from the modelling centres from India, China and other countries. Now, we can forecast for three days.Our capacity has significantly increased mainly in observing real time happenings. As I said, we take updates from hundreds of stations every 10 minutes. We also take satellite pictures from 16 channels of Japan’s Himawari Satellite, which has stationed its receiver in Nepal as well, also every 10 minutes. Until over a decade ago, we used to receive satellite pictures just once or twice a day. Even those pictures weren’t as good as those we get these days. We used to update surface-related data in three hours and upper air data in 12 hours. Based on that, we made a weather forecast for the next 12 hours. In comparison, we now have a large number of hydrological and meteorological real-time observation stations, the updates from Himawari and other satellites every 10 minutes and we have three radars to gather information. With the help of these technologies, now we can get immediate real-time updates. It helps us analyse the data of past hours and predict possible scenarios of the next six to 12 hours. We inform people accordingly. But we have to work more on the technology to make longer forecasts. Despite these progresses, we are still 15-20 years back in comparison to the technologies used by developed countries. We are behind in research. We need more expertise and an upgrade of our technology. Nepal doesn’t have its own satellite. Is this problematic?On the weather observation part, our work has not been hampered because we get data from the satellites of India, China and Japan. On the communication part, we are getting support from telecom companies—NTC and NCell—to transfer data. It covers most parts of the country. Absence of a satellite of our own is less of a concern compared to our other needs.Climate change has brought about massive changes in weather patterns. Do we have sufficient expertise to cope with this?The organisational structure and positions in our department haven’t changed much in over three decades. Demand for our work has drastically increased in the past two decades but we haven’t been able to cater to the demand. We need engineers capable of working with the latest technologies but we don’t have positions for such professionals in our current structure. We have procured some technologies and got some from our donors. But we don’t even have experts to use that as well.As you said, the department has made progress in the past decade but in this period climate change has progressed even faster. How do we keep up with this change?We face new challenges almost every year. In the past couple of years, mountain districts such as Manang and Mustang have not only witnessed rainfalls but also heavy downpours that even swept away bridges and other structures. Last year, over 30 hydropower projects were badly damaged by floods in eastern Nepal. The floods that wreaked havoc in Melamchi in 2021 were unprecedented. These incidents are evidence that climate change has already started to show unusual patterns and cause damages in this Himalayan range. We will face extreme weather patterns like long droughts and heavy rainfalls.The Dodhara weather station of Kanchanpur recorded 624mm of rainfall in 24 hours earlier this month. This is a new record. Before that, 540mm was the highest rainfall recorded, around two decades ago. Upward shifting of snowline in the mountains and formation of glacial lakes are other indications of the impacts of climate change. Don’t you think it’s already late to restructure government agencies, review policies and even redesign our systems?That is necessary. Devastation in Melamchi is one example that suggests the same. While developing such projects, we have to seriously consider possible impacts of climate change. Even if they analyse the possible scenario, they refer to the data of the past few decades. But things are changing so fast, decisions based on old data might not be useful. So, it is becoming more challenging to make projections. Design guidelines definitely need to be updated. Our division lacks policies, let alone updated ones. Though we are issuing red alerts and carrying out other tasks on scientific grounds, we don’t have a legal basis even to do these things.A large number of people in Nepal die in floods and landslides every year. Can we tweak our forecast system to save more lives?We have succeeded in reducing the deaths by floods in comparison to the loss we used to incur until 8-10 years ago. Earlier, we didn’t have flood alert service. It has been around a decade since we started the dedicated flood service. These days, we send mass SMS to the people of areas where floods may cause damage and for that we collaborate with telecoms—NTC and Ncell. We also work with district authorities and I/NGOs mainly in flood-prone districts to run campaigns and conduct drills. This has been quite effective. We are also taking similar initiatives in collaboration with telecom companies and other agencies to inform people on 13 various hydro-meteorological hazards such as, rains, lightning, winds.Working on floods is comparatively easier as it has certain catchment areas and we can focus on specific areas. So our efforts yield results. But in other incidents we can’t focus on certain areas. In floods, we inform the people hours before the flood so that they can shift to safe places. In the past, the death toll from floods used to be the highest. Now there are more deaths from landslides and lightning. We need to work more to give accurate information on lightning as well. Landslides vulnerability has increased due to extreme weather patterns, the impact of 2015 earthquake and rampant road construction.Why don’t people in Nepal follow and rely on weather forecasts? Is it due to negligence or lack of reliability of the prediction?It might be both. If the forecast doesn’t match reality, they may not follow or rely on us. So we need to improve our accuracy. Secondly, we need to increase awareness. Moreover, the weather isn’t as predictable as it used to be. So, we should keep on working, improving accuracy and making people aware. Many rely on international forecasts but not our own. Is our system less efficient?There are two aspects. One is getting accurate information and the second is user-friendly and attractive visual presentation of data, such as in mobile apps. We lag in the second part. Also, people want specific information about their locality and their intended destination. In the past, we used to give information by dividing the country in major regions such as eastern, central, western parts, tarai and hills. Now we have narrowed it down to each district. We need to work more on research.Have we succeeded in connecting weather forecasts to people’s livelihoods?The United Nations has launched the ‘Early Warning For All’ initiative to ensure that everyone on Earth is protected from hazardous weather, water, or climate events through life-saving early warning systems by the end of 2027. Various stakeholders need to join hands to implement it effectively as it has various components. Our expertise is to give as accurate information as we can. We give inputs but there are other agencies that go to the community level and work with the people.What are the things that need to be done in the changed context?We shouldn’t limit our work to simple forecasting but move to impact-based forecasts. For instance, we issue a seven-day Agromet Advisory Bulletin in collaboration with Nepal Agricultural Research Council which includes a summary on weather, crops, livestock, tables on weather and agrometeorological parameters, current weather information along with weather forecast (outlook). In a similar way, we can work with stakeholders on road transport as well. Then, we can make our forecast impactful, connect the general people and win their trust. But that requires proper policies and laws, updating this department’s organisational structure and enhancing the capacity of our human resource. \nThe July 1 midnight deal between the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, the first and the second largest parties in the federal lower house respectively, turned national politics on its head. Pushpa Kamal Dahal was thrown out as prime minister and KP Oli assumed the country’s leadership. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asked Maoist Centre leader Ram Karki, who has cultivated an image of a rebel within the party, on his reading of the event. How do you see the CPN-UML’s rebuffing of the CPN (Maoist Centre) and formation of a new government with the Nepali Congress?If you see it from the perspective of those who believe in parliamentary democracy, this is wrong. In the system, the largest party is believed to have the public mandate to run the government and the second-biggest to be the main opposition. A weak opposition makes for a weak parliamentary system. The system isn’t an ideal one for us [communists]. The two parties have made a mockery of the system they advocate for. Why didn’t the Maoist party that championed progressive agendas implement them when in government?We should admit that we lost the moral authority to implement and execute those agendas. We could have implemented those ideals by mobilising peasants, working-class groups, and people from oppressed communities, but our grip and connection with them have loosened.Why did the party and the leadership distance itself from the working class?The state has two arms—coercive and persuasive. The Maoists succeeded in using coercive force. But you can’t use this all the time. One has to use persuasive force most of the time. When we joined mainstream politics, we were the leading political force. We were in power. At the time we should have changed our education sector. For that, we should have worked on our curriculum and trained teachers. Our educational system is guided by patriarchal and feudal values. We need to orient people to questioning and following science. The party couldn’t do so. Had we done so, we would now have a critical mass with us. The Maoist leaders lost the moral ground. When you preach lofty ideas, the public won’t listen to you. They instead watch your lifestyle. Earlier, the Congress and the UML leaders, who were outsiders in Kathmandu, got ‘polluted’ when they worked in collusion with the capital’s elites. We, too, got ‘polluted’ by hobnobbing with the two parties. The working class and oppressed communities that had helped the Maoist party fight the state felt betrayed. The leaders and the masses are separated now. The Maoist party was the true leader of the progressive agenda such as inclusion, federalism, secularism and republicanism. These ideas are still valid, but the party failed to honour them. It failed because it lost its strength and disconnected itself from the class it fought for. It tried to become the leader of all people. The oppressed communities felt betrayal, while the other classes didn’t accept the party because of our past. Do you think the Congress and the UML will try to undermine progressive agendas enshrined in the new constitution?They have also sold lofty ideas to the people in the past. A counter-revolution under the two parties’ leadership is not easy. Their rank and file won’t accept it. The Congress, in fact, is not only a political party but a collective where you find radical Hindus as well as hardcore secularists. It stays strong as long as it works as a unified force of various groups. But when it imitates communists and tries to be a rigid cadre-based party, it loses its space and strength. So the Congress can’t lead a counter-revolution against progressive ideas. Counter-revolution is not easy, but the reactionary forces have certainly succeeded in regaining their space.Observers and politicians from rival parties claim that the Maoist Centre is now in an existential crisis. Do you think it can make a comeback?More importantly, the space that used to be occupied by the Maoist party is now left unoccupied.Can’t the UML or other forces make inroads into that space?The UML is a tried and tested force. Even the Maoist Centre is now described as a tested force. How can older forces enter that space? A force mightier than the Maoists can emerge. As a Maoist party member, I still vow to rejuvenate and revive the Maoist Centre. I am trying to convince my fellow comrades to do that. But my voice hasn’t prevailed. I have been presenting my papers in the party’s general conventions. We still have a strong belief that sooner or later, we will prevail because we are raising valid issues.Various leftist groups have at various times tried to create a strong, united left political force in Nepal. Do you think ideas like socialism and communism still attract the youth?Some rebel voices within our parties take some initiatives to raise our collective voice to build pressure on party establishments. But this has been limited to theoretical debates and failed to translate into politics. A theory or philosophy is like an iron plate, while crafting a tool from that iron is politics. We haven’t been able to transform our ideas into political action. If a leader floats a political agenda, the people first study the leader’s integrity. If a leader with a strong moral authority proposes an idea, people trust and follow it. If Gandhi was wearing a suit and telling people to wear handwoven khadi, Indian people wouldn’t have followed him. Similarly, if Mao was using clothes, watches and vehicles from developed countries while preaching for simplicity, Chinese people wouldn’t have followed him.Our people don’t listen to our leaders because they don’t see the leaders walk the talk. Youths are always attracted by adventurism; they are receptive and sensitive to certain incidents. Now, they aren’t following us because they don’t find any adventure and newness in our ideas. If we do some soul searching and correct ourselves, the Maoist Centre still can lead the process to complete the unfinished progressive agendas. Is that possible under the current Maoist leadership that has lost its credibility while staying in power for long? Will the people trust them?People will judge them based on their actions. If the Maoist leaders were more credible, there would be no space for the Congress and UML to come together. Either one or the other force would seek the Maoist party’s support. They wouldn’t have dared to ignore the Maoist party that led progressive issues in the recent past. They were emboldened because of the Maoists’ diminishing influence. Therefore, we have to correct ourselves in practice.You said that the classes and communities the Maoist party used to lead now have no leader. Can new outfits occupy that space?The traditional parties—the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre–don’t have any strategic vision on where they want to see the country in 20 years. The new forces are worse. They hit a ball and wherever it reaches, shift the goalpost there. They carry the goalpost with them. New forces with such visions can’t replace old parties. History shows that Nepal has witnessed political upheavals in a gap of 10-15 years. In the past such tsunamis have changed the political systems. Now we have seen sparks of movements but they are scattered. New forces need an ideological weapon. The Maoists forgot to sharpen their ideological weapon over time by holding ideological debates and upgrading themselves. Another is intra-party democracy. A political party that doesn’t practise intra-party democracy can’t enforce democracy in society.From the perspectives of intra-party democracy, the Maoist Centre is probably the most undemocratic of major political forces. Why?In the Congress, you are free to speak, but you don’t have a say in execution. Communist parties are too centralised. The structure conceptualised around a century ago in the context of wars and other contexts hasn’t been updated. Even new parties are run by the party chiefs imitating the anomalies of traditional forces. A leader is praised if s/he takes immediate decisions, gets them endorsed from the party committees and implements them swiftly. Those who say they have to first discuss the issue in party committees are described as weak. Such a trend is killing intra-party democracy.Do you think the Congress-UML coalition will succeed?A coalition between the parties that don’t even have a common minimum programme is a coalition of opportunists. They don’t have a moral ground either. On ideological grounds, the Congress still cites the late BP Koirala because no other leader of the party has worked on the theoretical front for decades. Such is also the situation with communists. They still cite the theoretical works of the late Pushpa Lal Shrestha. The current alliance is not a principled one, it’s a collaboration between opportunists. So, don’t expect anything better.How do you evaluate the outgoing government?It did nothing for the class it represents. The prime minister’s secretariat might have prepared a list of ‘100 important achievements of the government’. But what is the government’s priority? It failed to even give skills to those going abroad in search of work. They would have found better work had we given them valuable skills. Not only the outgoing one but all the previous governments have failed. The Congress-UML alliance has said it wants to review the constitution and amend the charter when necessary. How do you see this idea?This will be backtracking from the present constitutional roadmap. It is dishonest to create hindrance in implementing the federal system and then suggest the system is a burden. Such moves would give space to those who want to raise questions on republic and secular systems. There is a strong faction that lobbies for Hindutwa in the Nepali Congress. It is no secret that the Congress and the UML were not in favour of republic, secular and federal systems. But later, they rode the popular wave. But they have still not internalised it, and there are some regressive elements in both the parties but the people, who have come too far, won’t backtrack.Don’t you think the coming together of Congress and UML may ensure political stability?Instability is okay for me because stability may not necessarily be good for a country like ours. See, a single leader has been ruling a party continuously for over 30 years. What if they rule the country in a similar way? Look at some countries where a single leader has ruled for decades. The current arrangement is better than such stability.Will the Maoist party chairman and prime minister, who didn’t even appoint a minister from a Dalit community, have the moral authority to again champion the agenda of the oppressed?Appointing a minister is again an ornamental approach to appease certain communities. What we should do is ensure the participation of oppressed communities in policymaking.But party chair Dahal may again seek ways to get back to power. Will he pay attention to these issues?We should stop this chase for power at all cost. We will say this in our party meetings. We should accept the reality that we have just 32 seats and so we won’t get sufficient space to implement any important programmes even if we join the government.The way your party chief remained in power for over 18 months using various tactics, was it right?If you see it through a parliamentarian’s lens, it looks quite smart. If you see it through a Marxist perspective, just becoming a prime minister is futile if you can’t implement your policies and strengthen republicanism and participatory democracy. \nThe Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML last week reached an agreement to form a coalition government under the leadership of UML chair KP Sharma Oli. As a part of the package, they also aim to make certain changes to the constitution. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asked Pradeep Gyawali, deputy general secretary of UML, the reasons behind the coming together of the two largest parties, how they plan to run the government and to review and amend the constitution.Many are seeing the Congress-UML alliance as something unusual. What factors brought the two largest parties together even as there is no crisis-like situation or a special task such as constitution writing?Definitely, in normal parliamentary practice, the two largest parties don’t forge an alliance to run a government. The party that gets the biggest mandate leads the government, and the other big party remains in the opposition to make the ruling force accountable. In Nepal, the country’s two major forces, the Congress and the UML, have also joined hands in certain junctures for certain purposes. They worked together to make the constitution in 1990, to conduct general elections in 1999, to complete transition after the 2006 people’s movement and to bring out the constitution in 2015. We felt a need for a similar collaboration this time around. After the November 2022 elections, we saw three alliances in our parliament. At first, Maoist Centre chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal became prime minister with our support, but he failed to abide by the agreement sincerely. He changed the coalition within a month. The subsequent alliance between the Congress and the Maoist Centre lasted for a year. He again sought the UML’s support. Within four months of the March 4 deal with the UML, he started yet another gameplan to join hands with the Congress under the pretext of forming a national consensus government. It was quite unusual for the prime minister himself to instigate instability in the government. He publicly boasted that he had a ‘magical number’ [32 seats in the House of Representatives]. He thought that he could employ the tactic of ‘use and throw’ with the two largest parties and rule the country for the full term. He was completely indifferent to people’s plight, the country’s pressing issues and service delivery. This was the height of irresponsibility. So, the UML and Congress leaders concluded that the time had come to intervene to ensure political stability and service delivery and make sure public frustration doesn’t get out of hand. Did external factors play a role? Recent statements by UML leaders suggest that the party has taken it seriously. When national forces are weak, the neighbouring countries and international forces become more cautious, even more so given Nepal’s geo-political situation. Some of their concerns are valid. They fear political instability in Nepal may have an adverse impact on their genuine issues. We have to take this naturally. Second, it is no secret that we have a long legacy of facing external interference. Sometimes such interventions are carried out covertly and sometimes overtly. Therefore, national forces should be strong. Some political parties and leaders have a tendency of seeking external forces’ support to fulfil their vested interests. In return, they serve the external forces’ undue interests. Formation of a government is a purely domestic affair, but in our case sometimes it also becomes an issue of geopolitical interest. It is said that the UML was spooked when it learned that Prime Minister Dahal had reportedly approached the Congress for a new alliance. This reportedly happened after Dahal returned from New Delhi following Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s swearing-in.We were taken by surprise when the Congress leaders told us that the prime minister had reached out to them with a proposal to form a national consensus government. We were informed about the development from the leaders of the main opposition party. When we reached the March 4 deal with the prime minister, we thought he came to us with a commitment to course correction. Based on that, we supported him almost unconditionally. We didn’t bargain while sharing ministerial portfolios and didn’t talk about the prime minister’s term. We had even thought of allowing Dahal to run the government for the full term if the government functioned well and people were satisfied. We hadn’t even imagined that we would have to think about changing the coalition within four months.We definitely had certain grievances such as a lack of consultation with our party and our lawmakers while preparing the government’s policies and programmes and while allocating budget. Our party chair brought up this issue with the prime minister. But our concerns weren’t addressed. They had already started to ignore us. There were several issues with the prime minister, but we were committed to the partnership. But they had already gone too far. Fortunately, the Congress leaders didn’t accept the offer and instead raised critical questions about the rationale behind the proposal. Basically, the Congress didn’t trust Prachanda ji [Dahal] and came to us. It concluded that Dahal didn’t come with the intent of solving the country’s problems but to manoeuvre between the Congress and the UML.Besides jointly running the government, constitution amendment is another major aspect of the latest Congress-UML deal. What are the provisions the parties want to change?There are four major objectives of this agreement. Safeguarding national interest; strengthening economy; improving governance and service delivery; and ensuring political stability. A debate has started that some constitutional provisions are not helping maintain political stability. What we have said is that it’s been almost a decade since the promulgation of this constitution. Some of its provisions are yet to be implemented. On the other hand, provincial governments complain that they have not been able to work in a full-fledged way because the federal government has still not made some laws they need. So, first, we will undertake a comprehensive review on the progress in the course of implementing the constitution and the challenges we faced in the past decade, among other things. While doing so, we will find out if there are provisions that have posed challenges in maintaining political stability and running a stable government and suggest amendments accordingly.So, it’s not only about the amendment but also about review, assessment and recommendation for amendment, if there is a need. Even if the amendment process begins, it will be limited to ensuring political stability and won’t touch other aspects of the statute. There is no need to over-react. For instance, some Maoist leaders are trying to make it a political issue by describing it as a regressive move. That is wrong.So as per the two-party deal, the statute will be reviewed but not necessarily amended?Yes, whether to go for amendments will depend on the findings of the review. No constitution in the world is perfect. Its success largely depends on the practitioners. So, first we have to differentiate between the role of the constitution and the practitioners. It is true that our society is divided over certain provisions of our constitution. All these issues will be considered, but the fundamental features of the constitution such as democracy, inclusion and federalism won’t be altered. Our priority would be to only remove hindrances in making the system more functional, people-oriented and productive.Of late, people are debating the electoral system, provincial structure and secularism. Will these issues also be dealt with?Federalism is a new system for us. In fact, it is still an in-the-making process in Nepal. We have to note some timelines while analysing the performance of provinces. After the provincial and federal elections in 2017, the first provincial governments were formed in 2018, and they worked for around three years in a stable way. With small cabinets, they worked genuinely to strengthen the provincial system. At the time, most provincial cabinets had around six to seven ministers. They weren’t severely criticised at the time. The wrong trends in the provinces started with the division of the then Nepal Communist Party and the fall of the NCP-led governments at the centre as well as provinces. We saw the trend of horse-trading in provinces. Small parties made unjustified bargaining for ministerial portfolios, chief ministers started splitting ministries and increasing the number of ministers in their cabinets. Also, the November 2022 polls again gave a fragmented verdict, further augmenting the instability and anomalies at the provincial level. So, the problem is the way we are handling things more than the provincial structures. The time isn’t ripe to seek an alternative to the provinces. As far as the electoral model is concerned, we included proportional electoral (PR) system after long debates and discussions. Based on three general elections held after 1990, a conclusion was drawn that the first-past-the-post (FPTP) model couldn’t properly represent the historically under-represented sections. The premise is still valid. Based on the achievements, we may exclude certain communities from the list. But that time hasn’t come. Two questions raised over the use of PR are valid. Is the system really doing justice to the strata and class of the society for which it was introduced? This is the question not about the PR system but the leaders who use it. Similarly, some questions: Is proportional representation required in executive as well because representation is basically vital for policy making? The forms and modalities of the PR system might be discussed, but no one has even thought of removing the inclusive system.Similar is the case with secularism. The spirit is to make the state patron of all religions in the country. However, some sections of society have often tried to misuse and misinterpret the new constitutional provision. They try to interpret secularism as openly allowing rampant religious conversion, and some have made it an excuse to attack the age-old Sanatan faith. For instance, if the President or prime minister visits Lumbini, gurudwara or a shrine of any other faith on certain occasions, that is taken positively, but when they visit Pashupatinath Temple, a section of people raise questions. These activities have made some people think that these attacks on our Sanatan faith are taking place because of the secular system. There is no problem in the constitutional provision because the statute added an explanatory note that states, “‘secular’ means religious, cultural freedoms, including protection of religion and culture handed down from time immemorial.” But some extremist activities have given wrong impressions.Some experts believe the problem of fragmented mandate can be addressed by increasing the threshold required for a political party to be eligible to get PR seats, which can be done by amending laws. Will the Congress-UML alliance opt for this?Yes, this is one feasible option. I am in favour of this. As per the existing provision, a political party can secure seats under the PR category by securing 3 percent votes in the federal parliament and 1.5 percent votes in provincial assemblies. If a political organisation doesn’t even represent 5 or 7 or 10 percent of the population, what can they contribute to the country? You do politics to represent a sizable population and get a public mandate. Otherwise, the presence of such groups would only promote unreasonable bargaining and instigate instability in governments. This can be one of the agenda of the discussion between the two parties.This time, leaders have made it transparent that chiefs of the two parties will lead the government on a rotational basis. But why have other details of the agreement not been made public?There hasn’t been topic-wise discussions on specific provisions. The broader understanding is to review and assess the implementation aspect of the constitution and move ahead based on the findings of the assessment. We have also made it clear that such an act will be guided only by the objective of ensuring political stability and we will not go beyond that. Who will undertake this type of constitution review?We haven’t worked on it in detail. We haven’t reached any understanding. Naturally, inputs will be taken from the constitution makers, experts on constitutional law and politicians involved in this field. But no decision has been made on its nitty-gritty.The Rastriya Prajatantra Party that wants to revive the Hindu kingdom was the first party to welcome the Congress-UML deal while the Maoist Centre has accused Congress and UML of making a regressive move. So don’t you think this affair is tricky?I don’t think the political parties will touch the issues that the RPP talks about, such as reinstatement of Hindu kingdom and dissolution of federalism. No one is thinking about that. Also, the questions raised by the Maoist leaders have no meaning. They are only trying to make a political agenda.It also seems that the Congress and the UML floated this idea of reviewing the constitution to make a case for the two largest parties to form the government.That’s not true. This question undermines the spirit of this agreement. If this system fails, people will raise questions mainly to the leaders of the Congress and the UML, not Prachanda. It’s not only about running the government. We were already in the government and it isn’t a big deal for the Congress to return to power. If democracy fails, the democratic forces will lose the most. So we are genuinely working on this. The Congress and the UML are historical rival forces in Nepali politics. How can the two work together in government?It is true that the Congress and the UML are the two major competitors of this country. But we have some converging factors. First, we both believe in a broader democratic framework. Sometimes, the Congress may give more emphasis on liberal values while we may push for more socialism-oriented programmes. But the common ground is democratic values. We also have the experience of successfully carrying out certain tasks jointly. We may have some friction but we also have experience of managing bitter intra-party fighting as well as inter-party rivalry.How will the ministerial portfolios be shared in the new coalition?We haven’t reached any agreement in detail. As we aim to make this a ‘national consensus government’ we are in favour of accommodating other parties. So it will depend on the number of parties that join the Cabinet. Our only concern is that ministerial allocations should be done in a way that doesn’t weaken the prime minister in order to ensure that the head of the government can deliver.How can a government without the Maoist Centre and some other parties be called a consensus government?We have to wait for that. Leaders of political parties that fiercely criticise the government also join the Cabinet under one or other pretext. Some political parties seemingly cannot exist without being in the government.  \nThe Meteorological Forecasting Division forecast the weather across the country to be generally cloudy on Wednesday.Light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is expected at many places in Koshi, Bagmati, Gandaki, Lumbini, Karnali, and Sudurpaschim provinces, with a few areas in the rest of the country also experiencing similar conditions.

The monsoon trough is a low-pressure area that brings moisture-laden winds from the oceans and causes increased cloudiness and rains.“There is a chance of heavy to very heavy rainfall in some places of Koshi, Bagmati, Gandaki, Lumbini, and Sudurpaschim provinces and a few places of Karnali and Madhesh provinces,” reads the bulletin issued by the Met Office. “There is also a chance of extremely heavy rainfall in one or two places of Bagmati, Gandaki, and Lumbini provinces.”The Met Office warned of the risk of landslides, debris flow, and land erosion in the hills and risks of floods and inundation in urban areas and in the Tarai. Water levels in small and big rivers could rise, and daily life, agriculture, health, tourism, and land and air transportation could also be affected, according to the bulletin. The Met Office has asked the general public and all relevant agencies for precautions.This is the sixth special bulletin issued by the Met Office since the start of the monsoon on June 10.The monsoon season in Nepal generally begins on June 13 and ends on September 23. This year, the monsoon entered Nepal from the southwest on June 10, three days ahead of the usual onset date. Last year, it started on June 14, a day later than normal.This year, the division has forecast above-normal rains and above-average maximum and minimum temperatures this monsoon, which could unleash extreme weather events such as flooding, inundation, and landslides.Several districts have already reported incidents of landslides, flooding and lightning since the start of the monsoon season.According to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority, at least 150 people have died, and scores have been injured and missing in landslides, flood and lightning-related incidents since June 10.What do red, orange and yellow warnings signify?Red warning: According to Met officials, a red warning means looming extreme weather conditions. Excessive rainfall, floods, landslides, inundation, and others are likely to cause widespread damage. For the general public, it is a message to keep themselves and others safe from the extreme weather consequences and not to travel in risky zones. “Along with the general public, this is also an alert to all agencies concerned to gear up for response,” said Raju Pradhananga, a senior meteorologist.Red alerts have been issued for the districts of Taplejung, Panchthar, Sankhuwasabha, and Terhathum in the Koshi province; and Rasuwa, Chitwan, Nuwakot, Dhading, Sindhupalchok, and Dolakha in the Bagmati province. Likewise, Myagdi, Kaski, Baglung, Parbat, Syangja, Tanahun, Nawalparasi-East, Lamjung and Gorkha districts of the Gandaki province are also in the red zone. Similarly, red alerts have been issued for Kapilvastu, Rupandehi, Palpa, Gulmi, Nawalparasi-West, Dang, Banke, Bardia, Gulmi, Arghakhanchi of Lumbini province, as well as Kailali, Kanchanpur, Dadeldhura, Doti and Baitadi of the Sudurpaschim province.Orange warning: An orange warning also means moderate risks. Experts say severe situations due to extreme weather events are very likely in the said districts. For the general public, it is a message to make preparatory plans for potential emergencies. As the probability of extreme weather events is high, it is also a request not to travel in risky zones—landslide-prone roads and riverbanks, among others. According to Pradhananga, it is also a request to people to protect themselves and family members.The orange warning has been issued for the Okhaldhunga, Jhapa and Morang districts of the Koshi province; Siraha, Saptari and Dhanusha of Madhesh, and Ramechhap, Kathmandu and Bhaktapur of Bagmati. Orange warning has been also issued in Manang of the Gandaki province; Rukum-East and Rolpa of Lumbini, Dailekh, Surkhet, Salyan, Rukum-West, Jajarkot and Kalikot of the Karnali province; and Darchula and Achham of the Sudurpaschim province.Yellow warning: A yellow warning signifies serious consequences from extreme weather events, but its chances are very low. The bad weather conditions could disrupt daily lives. The yellow warning has been issued in Mustang, Dolpa, Mugu, Humla, Jumla, Bajura and Bajhang districts. \nToday, Nepal is expected to experience partly to generally cloudy conditions.
