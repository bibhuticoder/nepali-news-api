Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nA day after the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML sealed a deal to form a new political alliance and decided to amend some provisions of the constitution, Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who was largely left out of the new power-sharing process, has refused to step down from the post.The political fraternity has been divided over the new understanding between the Nepali Congress and the UML. But the prime minister’s decision to cling on and seek a vote of confidence is set to delay the process of forming a new government, which will be led by UML chairman KP Sharma Oli as per the understanding. On Tuesday, a UML secretariat meeting requested all political parties to join the new government of ‘national consensus’ and contribute to political stability. As per the Congress-UML understanding to form the government under Article 76 (2) of the constitution, the UML meeting also called on the prime minister to pave the way by Wednesday evening.“The meeting endorsed the agreement reached between the Congress and the UML,” Pradeep Gyawali, deputy general secretary of the UML, said after the meeting. Contrary to widespread expectations, the UML has decided to delay its earlier plan to immediately recall ministers from the Dahal Cabinet. “We don’t want more animosity [against the Maoist Centre] and so we did not recall our ministers today,” Gyawali said. “But if the prime minister does not pave the way for new government formation by tomorrow [Wednesday] evening, we will recall our ministers and take other necessary steps.”“If the prime minister ignores UML’s request [to quit], our party will withdraw its support to the government.”The party has eight ministers in the Dahal Cabinet. The UML has also given a reason for its decision to sever ties with Dahal. “The prime minister was in talks with the Congress for a month in order to form a national consensus government, which created a situation of mistrust,” said Gyawali. “This ultimately forced us to initiate talks with the Nepali Congress.” After Congress rejected Dahal’s proposal, the UML and Congress started talking seriously to unseat Dahal, according to Gyawali. “The UML and the Congress started talking and decided to move ahead together for political stability and democratic exercise,” he said. The UML meeting also endorsed the understanding with the Congress, expressing hope that a new government would ensure political stability, help mend the crisis-ridden economy, and address growing public frustration. Gyawali said his party had no plans to ditch the current coalition despite some internal issues. “We were prepared to give continuity to the government. But some interesting developments started unfolding in national politics. The prime minister started discussions about forming a national government without consulting anyone, prompting us to question the objective and necessity of such a government,” said Gyawali. He also recounted Dahal’s history of kicking out the UML from the government within just 15 days of government formation last year. “So we became suspicious of the prime minister,” said Gyawali, “But Nepali Congress did not accept the prime minister’s request this time.” As the picture of the new government remains unclear, there is also confusion over Cabinet formation and discussions about power-sharing between the Nepali Congress, UML and other parties. “On Cabinet formation, we have reached a broad understanding with the UML, but we are yet to finalise the names of ministers,” a Congress office bearer told the Post. Besides the UML, the Congress has also separately asked the prime minister to step down. On Monday midnight, Nepali Congress chief Sher Bahadur Deuba and UML chair Oli also agreed to form a high-powered constitution review committee to suggest amendments to the constitution, bypassing key ruling partners like the CPN (Maoist Centre) and the Rastriya Swatantra Party.Besides the Nepali Congress and the UML, other parties like the Rastriya Prajatantra Party, Loktantrik Samajbadi Party, Janata Samajbadi Party (Upendra Yadav faction) have welcomed the new deal. Deuba, according to one Congress leader, also met CPN (Unified Socialist) chair Madhav Kumar Nepal on Tuesday evening and asked him to join the new political process. Nepal responded that he would discuss the matter in the party. The CPN (Maoist Centre), the Rastriya Swatantra Party, and the CPN (Unified Socialist) have opposed the deal. The RSP, a key party in the government, said that it would remain in the government so long as the prime minister stays in office. After the deal with the Congress, Oli met Prime Minister Dahal on Tuesday morning and asked him to step down, but Dahal refused to do so, according to Maoist Centre leaders. Dahal, after meeting Oli, convened a meeting of the party’s secretariat, where he discussed the latest political situation and updated party leaders on his interactions with Oli and Deuba in the past few days. Devendra Poudel, the Maoist Centre party secretary, said it has been decided that the prime minister will not resign and he will instead seek a vote of confidence in the House.In the meeting, Dahal was reportedly angry with Oli, whom Dahal accused of betraying him. “Deuba showed political culture, but not Oli,” Dahal said in the meeting. “I didn’t expect such a move from Oli with whom I had very cordial talks even until Monday afternoon.”“We are not escaping, and we are not afraid,” said Devendra Poudel. “We have decided to deal with the situation politically.”Dahal went to meet President Ram Chandra Poudel on Tuesday and informed the President that he would follow the constitutional course. Dahal advised the President to call for government formation based on Article 76 (3) of the constitution, according to which the leader of the single largest party in the House of Representatives—Deuba in this case—will be called to form a new government. The Maoist Centre has also objected to the understanding between the Congress and the UML on amending the constitution, terming it a ‘regressive’ step. Dahal told the President that he would follow the constitution, which means he will face a no-confidence motion in the House. As per Article 100 of the constitution, the prime minister will have 30 days to seek a vote of confidence.When the decision to withdraw support reaches Parliament, the date for seeking a vote of confidence will be fixed as per parliamentary regulations.“Seeking a vote of confidence is the prerogative of the prime minister and so he is not bound to resign,” said Bipin Adhikari, an expert on constitutional matters. “Tendering resignation is his choice but seeking a vote of confidence within 30 days of a party withdrawing support is his constitutional right.”A senior UML leader told the Post that Oli wants to be the prime minister under Article 76 (2).If no political party commands a majority in the House, the President can call for government formation under Article 76 (2).“In cases where no party has a clear majority in the House of Representatives under clause (1), the President shall appoint as the Prime Minister a member of the House of Representatives who can command a majority with the support of two or more parties representing the House of Representatives,” says the Article.The spirit of this Article is to provide a strong and stable government, said Adhikari, and so the President can call for government formation under this Article.“We are consulting on what to do and exploring legal options in case the prime minister declines to step down or delays the vote of confidence,” a Congress office bearer told the Post.As per the understanding, Oli will lead a new ‘national consensus’ government for a year and a half. For the remaining term of Parliament, Deuba will be the prime minister. Both parties have also tentatively reached a power-sharing deal, including on division of ministerial portfolios, amendments to the constitution, review of the electoral system, including proportional representation, change of national assembly arrangements, and the size of provincial assemblies, according to the understanding reached between the two sides.As per the draft understanding, the Congress will lead 10 ministries, including home, and the UML nine, including finance. Likewise, the Congress and the UML will lead three provincial governments each, with the government in Madhesh to be led by a regional party.  \nThe two major parties, the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, reached a written agreement on Monday to form a new government. Although the leaders of both the parties said they have agreed to amend the constitution, the agreement document is reportedly silent on it. “Leaders of two parties have agreed in principle to amend the constitution, but the amendment has not been included in the power-sharing agreement,” a Congress leader who is closely associated with the latest political developments told the Post on the condition of anonymity. “We are still discussing how to make changes to the constitution.” Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba informed his party leaders during a meeting on Tuesday morning that they have decided to amend the constitution, as per the party insider.The midnight deal between the Congress and the UML on Monday, however, has decided that UML chair KP Sharma Oli will lead the government for the first half of the remaining term of Parliament. “On Monday, the two parties essentially agreed on three major points,” a UML leader closely involved in the political developments told the Post. “To form a stable government, to address the country’s economic crisis, and new government leadership.” The UML leader also confirmed that there is no written agreement on amending the constitution. However, he claimed that the constitution amendment will happen in due course after the formation of the Congress-UML government.UML General Secretary Shankar Pokharel also claimed that the new Congress-UML government plans to amend the constitution to ensure political stability. After the agreement on power-sharing between Congress and UML on Monday night, the general secretary wrote on social media that a ‘national consensus government’ would be formed under Oli’s leadership. “There is an agreement to form a government of national consensus under Oli's leadership to amend the constitution for political stability and draft laws accordingly,” Pokharel wrote.Although they are yet to disclose the proposed amendments, both Congress and UML leaders have been questioning the relevance of the current electoral system. So long as the electoral system (a mix of direct and proportional elections) remains, no single party will secure a majority, therefore, the two parties have decided to change the electoral system, according to leaders of the two parties the Post spoke with. In the UML, there is a strong opinion that for a party to be a national party, the minimum vote threshold should increase from 3 percent to 5 percent of the total valid votes cast under the proportional category, says a UML leader. When it comes to the electoral system, the Congress leaders are not happy with the proportional electoral system.Since the first constituent assembly election in 2008, Nepal has been practising a mixed electoral system in which 60 percent of representatives are elected through direct election, whereas 40 percent are elected through proportional representation. “If we start amending the constitution, the process might not stop at changing the electoral system,” says former Chief Election Commissioner Nilkantha Uprety. He terms the proportional system as a big political achievement and says it should be continued.“We introduced this system to ensure proportional representation of all groups and communities in the country,” Uprety told the Post. “The system is still very relevant in the Nepali context.” Just changing the electoral system does not ensure political stability, Uprety said. “I hope our political parties give serious thought to the things that the country needs to change and the things it needs to keep constant,” he added. “We should avoid going back to a pre-2008 state when there was no proportional representation.”While the two party leaders are planning to amend the constitution to give the country a semblance of stability, a two-thirds majority in both the lower and upper house is needed to amend the charter. This means 184 seats in the 275-strong federal parliament. Not just that. In any matter related to any of the seven provinces, the provincial legislatures must also approve the amendments, again with two-thirds majority. Though the Congress and the UML, largest parties in Parliament with 88 and 78 seats, have joined hands to form the government, they will still need the support of 18 more lawmakers to achieve a two-thirds majority in the lower house. And in the 59-member upper house, the two parties will need the backing of every party except the CPN (Maoist Centre) to secure a two-thirds (40 votes) majority, to amend the constitution. “The constitution amendment will not happen in haste. It is a long process that the Congress-UML government will accomplish in time,” says Gyanendra Bahadur Karki, Congress leader.“If the two largest parties decide to amend the constitution, I believe we will be able to muster the numbers in both the Houses,” Karki told the Post.Meanwhile, the Maoist Centre has seen the agreement between the Congress and UML to amend the constitution with suspicion. A Maoist Centre meeting held at Baluwatar on Tuesday morning interpreted the amendment proposal as the two largest parties questioning the current political system in the name of seeking political stability.“Where will the constitutional amendment lead us?” the secretary of Maoist Centre, Devendra Paudel, asked. “If the constitutional amendment was that necessary, it could also have been done close to the next election cycle.”  \nNepal’s second international airport, inaugurated in the country’s south in May 2022, has seen no international flights for a year and a half now.Locals, businesses, and hoteliers had high hopes for the Gautam Buddha International Airport, the gateway to Lumbini, the birthplace of the Buddha, to transform the economic landscape of the province. With no flights coming in anytime soon, they have again appealed to the federal government to prepare a workable strategy to operate it.A government official at the National Statistics Office recently told the Post that Lumbini Province suffered a recession this year, with most shops shuttered due to low business activity.On Monday, the private sector representatives of Rupandehi, Kapilvastu, and Nawalparasi West appealed to the members of parliament to sketch a business plan to operate the airport and revive Lumbini's economy.Members of a subcommittee formed by the parliamentary Public Accounts Committee to probe the alleged irregularities while constructing the airport are inspecting it.At an interaction on Monday, local stakeholders and private sector representatives said that the airport inaugurated more than two years ago saw a few flights until the end of 2022 but no airline served it again.The participants said that with the airport, built at an investment of nearly Rs40 billion, remaining quiet, billions of private sector investment is at risk. For a long time, the private sector has clamoured for international flights. Industry entrepreneurs, traders, people’s representatives, and civil society leaders demanded the government do something about it.“The government should realise that there are areas outside Kathmandu also that need its attention,” said Thakur Kumar Shrestha, president of the Siddhartha Chamber of Commerce and Industry.He questioned the subcommittee’s intent.“If they [parliamentary members] have come here aiming to operate the airport, there is a need for a policy-level decision to make the new airport viable.”Yogesh Bhattarai, coordinator of the subcommittee, and eight members of the Public Accounts Committee reached the airport for inspection. During the discussion, the lawmakers admitted the government's lapses and lack of seriousness about operating the new airport, which has pushed private investments to the brink.“We have been in serious trouble,” Shrestha said.“The government has not even discussed the new airport with ambassadors from various countries. Besides, people have to visit Kathmandu to get labour permits. If all works are performed from the Capital, how can the new airport operate,” Shrestha said.Chandra Prakash Shrestha, president of the Siddhartha Hotel Association, said that the government has already spent more than Rs40 billion for the construction of the airport.The private sector has already invested Rs80 billion in hotels and restaurants, hoping that the airport's operation will increase the number of tourists.“The entrepreneurs who took loans from banks are in trouble. The situation is getting worse day by day,” Shrestha said. “Despite the pressure from the private sector for a long time, the government has done nothing.”Shrestha said that to start international flights, the Kathmandu-centric activities need to be decentralised. “We are pressuring it continuously, but the government does not listen.”Bishnu Paudel, former finance minister, said resuming international flights from Bhairahawa was missing from the government's agenda. “It is off the government’s working list to operate the airport. That is why there are no flights.”Paudel said the government has not invited international airlines to fly from the airport. “If the airport does not come into operation, it will feed a bad development narrative.”Paudel said the airport needs to be operated at full capacity in an organised way. Essential preparations should have started as soon as construction began, but it is already too late now.Bhattarai said that tourism entrepreneurs, industry entrepreneurs, and civil society feel that the airport needs to be operational without further delay. “We have collected the feedback, and the subcommittee will suggest that the government create a conducive environment for international flights.”“We are taking information regarding the investment, its need and design and construction, including the government’s investment and operation plan,” Bhattarai said.On Monday morning, the subcommittee discussed the matter with the chief of airport management, immigration, customs, and airport security agency.“We have asked the airport management many questions. Some have been answered, some have not,” said Bhattarai. \nThe COVAX facility, the United Nations-backed international vaccine-sharing scheme, has been supplying vaccine doses to Nepal for the last three days.Officials said that the vaccine is part of the 1.6 million doses the facility has committed to supply to the country in 2024.“We received 46,000 doses on the first day,” said Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the immunisation section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “Vaccine doses arrived yesterday and today too.”The COVAX-supplied vaccine doses are Pfizer-BioNTech monovalent vaccines, including the children’s vaccine. The monovalent or single component is designed for the Omicron variant XBB.1.5 of SARS-CoV-2.Officials said that the vaccine doses will be administered to the vulnerable groups, including pregnant women, those having compromised immunity, people suffering from chronic diseases and children having compromised immunity.Officials say around 100,000 vaccine doses will be administered to children between five and 11 having compromised immunity, including those suffering from cancer, HIV and other chronic diseases.They said that administration of vaccine doses is likely to start in the last week of July.Last month, Nepal confirmed the spread of the Covid sub-lineages KP.1, KP.2, KP.3, and KP.4 in the country. All the sub-variants are offshoots of the Omicron variant, which is considered responsible for the surge in new Covid cases in the last few months.Hospitals in Kathmandu had reported a surge in serious cases of Covid infection in April. Doctors attending to the infected patients had said that elderly people and those with underlying conditions were getting severe.The COVAX facility supplied millions of doses of various brands of the coronavirus vaccine which were used to inoculate the majority of the country's population.Earlier, the facility used to supply Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent vaccine doses that included a component of the original virus strain as well as a part of the Omicron variant to provide broad protection against Covid.The vaccine is called a bivalent Covid shot as it contains two components—the original virus strain, and Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 sub-variants.Over 12,000 people died and hundreds of thousands were infected in the first, second and third waves of the Covid pandemic in Nepal. \nThe Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML sealed a mid-night deal on Monday agreeing to form a new government ousting Pushpa Kamal Dahal as prime minister.According to the deal, KP Sharma Oli, the UML chairman, will lead the coalition for the first half of the three-and-a-half years until the next election. He will hand over the premiership to Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, who will oversee the elections. However, how soon Oli will move into Baluwatar from Balkot will depend on Dahal’s decision.The UML, the senior coalition partner in the Dahal government, hasn’t recalled its ministers from the Cabinet. Nor has it withdrawn its support to the prime minister. Its secretariat meeting on Tuesday asked Dahal to clear the way for a national consensus government by resigning.\"We will look at other constitutional options [quitting the government and withdrawing the support] only if the prime minister refuses to quit,\" said Rajendra Gautam, the UML's publicity department chief.Countdown of the CPN (Maoist Centre)-led government will begin the day the UML withdraws its support. Dahal will then be left with two options: resign or face Parliament. An office bearer meeting of the Maoist Centre decided that the prime minister will not quit but go for the floor test.Any party that proves the majority in the House of Representatives leads the government, said Devendra Paudel, the Maoist Centre secretary. “The prime minister will not resign,” Paudel said. “He will take the constitutional course [opt for the vote of trust].”Article 100 (2) of the constitution states that if the political party the prime minister represents is divided or a political party in the coalition withdraws its support, the prime minister shall table a motion in the House of Representatives for a vote of confidence within 30 days.Dahal will have a month at most, from the day the UML withdraws its support, to go for the trust vote. It will be Dahal’s fifth floor test since he formed the post-election government in December 2022. Last time he faced Parliament was on May 20 after the Upendra Yadav-led Janata Samajbadi Party withdrew its support.As it is certain that he will lose the vote of confidence without the UML and the Congress backing him, the President will call for the formation of a new government with a two- to three-day deadline.The provision at hand is Article 76, which deals with government formation. There are four provisions in the constitution for appointing the prime minister. As no party has a majority, the President can call for the coalition government as per Article 76 (2).The article states that in cases where no party has a clear majority, the President shall appoint as prime minister “a member of the House who can command a majority with the support of two or more parties”.The first and the second largest parties, the Congress and the UML, have a combined strength of 167, much above the majority mark of 138 in the 275-member House. While the UML has 78 members excluding the Speaker, the Congress has 79.Senior advocate Dinesh Tripathi said there are rumors that the President has to initiate government formation as per Article 76 (3)—a minority government—if Dahal, who was appointed under Article 76 (2), fails the floor test.“This argument is incorrect. The President can call the parties to form a coalition government as per Article 72 (2) after Dahal fails the vote of confidence,” he said. “Several verdicts by the Supreme Court have clearly said that every available option for government formation can be used.”In its recent verdict to retain the Hikmat Karki-led government in Koshi Province, the top court said the same constitutional provision can be cited for more than once. Advocate Raju Prasad Chapagain, former chairperson of the Constitutional Lawyers’ Forum, said the Constitutional Bench made a similar ruling while overturning the twin decisions of Oli to dissolve the House of Representatives in December 2020 and May 2021.“There is no bar for the President to trigger government formation based on Article 76 (2),” said Chapagain. “He can make a call for a minority government as per Article 76 (3) only if a coalition government cannot be installed.” \nWhat has happened in Nepali politics in the past 48 hours—as in by late night of Tuesday, when this paper went to print—cannot be explained simply on the basis of mainstream political theory. In the intervening midnight of Monday and Tuesday, when most Nepalis were asleep, septuagenarians Sher Bahadur Deuba of the Nepali Congress and KP Sharma Oli of the CPN-UML sealed a deal to form a new government. Such is the distrust among the new coalition partners that they could not wait until daybreak to meet in their sophisticated offices or even drawing rooms to do so, as they chose the house of a businessman to decide the country’s future course.That the top leaders of the country’s two biggest political parties had to be brought together to form a new coalition government by an outsider exposes the degenerate nature of our politics. For now, let’s come back to the point about political theory failing to explain the drama that gets performed on the Nepali political stage in the name of constitution and democracy. Perhaps in order to explain the actions of the top three players of Nepali politics—Deuba, Oli, and Pushpa Kamal Dahal— political theorists would want to draw a bit from game theory, whereby the actions of a player are dependent on the possible strategies of another player.Other things being the same, the Dahal-led government is all but gone thanks to the Deuba-Oli midnight rendezvous. Dahal will likely be replaced by Oli, who will then make way for Deuba after a year and a half—if they stick to their promise. Whether the new marriage of the ideological opposites will survive depends on the checkmates they use against each other on the moral, policy-level and financial corruption committed by each other. The Giri Bandhu tea estate scandal and the fake Bhutanese refugees scandal, in which the UML and the Congress bigshots, respectively, are allegedly involved, are a case in point.In fact, the foundation for the new coalition was prophetically—or even pathetically—laid over three months ago during Dahal’s floor test in Parliament. Oli, while offering his support to Dahal, had signaled to Deuba of his interest in forming a coalition, to which Deuba had responded with a nod and a smile. It was not difficult to understand that Oli was not very happy to have struck a deal with Dahal, who is well-known for his propensity to change partners in a jiffy; nor was it difficult to get Deuba’s hope amid despair that either Dahal or Oli could come back to him at any point to form yet another coalition. After all, for our old leaders, changing coalition partners is a matter of convenience rather than conviction.If we are still looking for some silver lining amid the black cloud of political uncertainty, it is this: Dahal’s reputation as a kingmaker-turned-king with just 32 seats in a 275-strong parliament has taken a big jolt. The coming together of the two biggest parties of Parliament is never a good sign for parliamentary democracy, for that leaves us without a strong opposition. But in bringing Dahal to the ground at last, the Deuba-Oli duo has given a message that an electoral pigmy can no longer play a permanent badshah in the game of thrones that is Nepali politics.  \nIn most oligarchies of the world, power-sharing arrangements are negotiated behind the curtain and inked in darkness. The supremo of CPN-UML, Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli, is a habitual night owl—even a foreign spook, Samanta Goel, had to schedule a meeting with him late in the evening. Perhaps an astrologer suggested the leader of the largest party in Pratinidhi Sabha and the Chair of the Nepali Congress (NC), Sher Bahadur Deuba, to sign a pact with the supremo of the second-largest party in Parliament after midnight. The deal is finally sealed, and the foremost democratic force of the country will be collaborating with the dominant communist party to entrench an ethnocratic regime.Maoist supremo Dahal has been jumping from the NC camp to the UML platform and the other way round with the regularity of a hawker and the dexterity of an acrobat. He had swiftly set up a meeting with Sharma Oli to placate his senior partner in the coalition and offered to quit in favour of the latter to maintain the status quo. The permanent establishment of Nepal (PEON) seems to have scuttled his plans.The PEON has been vouching for a rapprochement between the NC and the UML for quite a while. Since the restoration of parliamentary democracy in 1990, these two parties have joined hands or taken turns ruling the country for much of the duration. They have much more at stake in maintaining the ethnonational oligarchy than the Maoists. When the influence of the two dominant parties was reduced in the Constituent Assembly elections of 2008, they had worked assiduously to have it dissolved through a judicial intervention. No matter how hard Dahal tried to propitiate the high priests of Khas-Arya hegemony—ritualistically worship a buffalo, don the Daura-Suruwal ensemble or offer prescribed prayers at the temple of Mahakal in Ujjain—he failed to win their confidence. In the eyes of ethnonational zealots, Dahal had unleashed the forces of dignity politics—Dalit empowerment, Janjati awakening and Madheshi autonomy—that must be put back in their places through regressive changes in the electoral system.The proponents of Dalit empowerment are still too weak to challenge the existing sociopolitical order. The fragmented and resigned Janjati groups lack the will to resist the hegemonic designs of Khas-Arya ethnonationalists. The only community that could have countered the resurgence of ethnonational majoritarianism was that of Madheshis. Sadly, a craving for the crumbs from the high table has turned most politicos of Madhesh-dependent parties from committed activists to devoted conformists.Externalised MadheshisIt’s difficult to name a Madheshi politician who played an important role in the governance of Nepal in the pre-republican era. Ram Narayan Mishra, a cabinet minister in the short-lived BP Koirala government, stands out as an exception. Put behind bars after the royal-military coup, Mishra remained incarcerated and was freed only to die from a terminal disease. Justice Aniruddha Prasad Singh, Justice Bhagwati Prasad Singh and politician Chaturbhuj Prasad Singh—the ABC Singhs of Saptari—did rise to the highest posts, but they were merely royal loyalists at the beck and call of their master.The restoration of parliamentary democracy brought a new set of political players that shared their ethnonational beliefs with those of the ousted regime. Mahendra Narayan Nidhi was perhaps the best Prime Minister this country never had because of ethnic prejudices among the NC ranks. Gajendra Narayan Singh tried hard to establish amity between Pahadis and Madheshis based on political equality and social dignity through his Sadbhavana platform. He was repeatedly booed in public.Just as in the absolutist Shah era (1960-90), under the name of Panchayat, the highest ambition of an upwardly mobile Madheshi was to ape the dominant community in dress, language and mannerism, and become a mimic man of a “true Nepali”. The violent campaigns of Maoists and counter-violence of the state forces in the aughties were dreadful, but they did succeed in establishing the recognition of diversity in the manufactured uniformity of national unity. It’s the experience of the marginalised and externalised communities between 1990 and 2008 that makes the prospect of a political settlement between the NC and the UML terrifying.Useful toolsWhen the UML emerged as a powerful force of the post-1990 order, its leaders found, to their chagrin, that their presence in Madhesh was limited to the Pahadi community. They wanted Madheshi youths to build their organisation in a region that the NC had traditionally dominated. Ambitious Madheshis also discovered that they had little chance to rise fast in the NC, which was a party in the tight grip of the old guard. In addition to being ambitious, Upendra Yadav also possesses a sharp mind. He was already a foot soldier of the communist radicals, and when they constituted themselves into a parliamentary party as the UML, he became its low-level apparatchik.Yadav used his uncanny ability of sensing the direction of the wind and jumped on the Maoist bandwagon but remained carefully clear of direct armed confrontations. Contentions are often based on inferences, but the allegation that the non-party Madheshi Janadhikar Forum was constituted to counter the Madhesh Mukti Morcha of the Maoists with the covert support of the PEON doesn’t look too far-fetched. Barely active in anti-monarchy protests before 2006, Yadav became the public face of the Madhesh Uprising 2007, which challenged and beat the Maoists at their own game of violent propaganda. He then lost little time in making peace with his former enemies of the Gaur Massacre and became the messiah of sorts in Madhesh after the formation of the first Constituent Assembly in Nepal's history.In much of South Asia, people vote for their caste rather than casting their votes. Yadav prioritised caste solidarity over political affiliations and helped elect Ram Baran Yadav of the NC as the first President of the new republic. The PEON now had a new Yadav face to show in Madhesh and a pliant tool to control the polity and society. The political perseverance and tenacity of Upendra Yadav are admirable, but he seems resigned to his marginalisation after the overt entry of CK Raut into the electoral arena. The masters like to change their horses not just for utility but also for fun. The Yadavs remain the dominant caste in the entire Tarai-Madhesh and are the single largest group with 15.2 percent of the population in Madhesh province. However, an assertion of non-Yadav solidarity between what are colloquially termed the other backward classes (OBCs) and the extremely backward classes (EBCs) castes had necessitated the nurturing of a sufficiently rebellious but conveniently compliant face from the group to counter the possible consolidation of Muslim-Yadav (MY) alliance in Madhesh.Since its formation, the Loktantrik Samajbadi Party (LSP) has always been a loose coalition of predominantly upper-caste and primarily comfortable class of politicians in a patron-client relationship with their relatively reliable vote banks. They have little incentive to engage in combative politics.Perhaps it will take a while for Madheshi politicos to realise that conformity breeds contempt, and confrontation with the majoritarian ethnonationalists for political equality, economic justice and social dignity is the only way of making a mark on history.  \nWith the Copa América, the UEFA European Championship and the Olympic Games all taking place over a few months, summer 2024 is shaping up to be a celebration of sport.However, many modern sporting events have been held in countries with appalling human rights records, with little pushback from fans, broadcasters or governments. In a world where celebrities are held to high moral standards—and face consequences for falling short—this inconsistency is striking.My historical research focuses on this troubling issue, aiming to understand why sport often evades the scrutiny we so readily apply to other events and individuals.Qatar 2022For years before its first match began, the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar was marred by accusations of sportswashing, environmental damage, exorbitant costs and, most critically, severe human rights abuses—including the country’s treatment of women, the LGBTQ+ community and migrant workers.Among these widely reported allegations was one especially harrowing statistic: over 6,500 migrant workers from India, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh died while building hotels and stadiums in preparation for the 2022 World Cup. This means that each minute of football played at the tournament equated to the loss of one human life.While the Qatari government put the death toll far lower, at 47, these abuses were no secret in the run up to the event. Still, they had little impact on public opinion—in the weeks leading up to the tournament, fans were more concerned about how the winter timetable would affect the regular football season, or their ability to consume alcohol in a Muslim country.Calls for a boycott failed to catch on, and the event went on to garner high ratings, with one BBC poll even declaring it the best World Cup of the century.Greed and corruption are obvious explanations for how this was allowed to happen. There is substantial evidence of corruption within both FIFA and Qatar, particularly regarding the bidding process for the games.Reports also indicate that some fans were paid by the host to sing and chant on command, and celebrities were paid huge amounts to attend and endorse the event, thereby whitewashing Qatar’s human rights record.Such blatant displays of greed are not always met with apathy. In 2021, for example, the attempt to form the European Super League faced widespread, vehement criticism from fans, football players, managers, and politicians, and the multi-million dollar venture was swiftly axed as a result.The unique, irrational appealObjectively speaking, Qatar’s human rights abuses are unforgivable. However, humanity’s fascination with sport is emotional rather than rational, meaning it is extremely difficult to analyse or explain from an objective point of view.It is therefore worth considering how organisers addressed human rights concerns in the run up to the 2022 World Cup. Shortly before the its opening, FIFA President Gianni Infantino and Secretary General Fatma Samoura wrote the following in a letter to competing teams: “Please, let’s now focus on the football! We know football does not live in a vacuum and we are equally aware that there are many challenges and difficulties of a political nature all around the world. But please do not allow football to be dragged into every ideological or political battle that exists.”Such a statement may seem cynical and calculated, but it reflects a widespread perception that modern sports are pure, universal and autotelic—meaning an activity in and of itself, rather than a means to an end. This is often expressed in claims like “sport is art”, or that sports should be separate from politics.Sport’s appeal for both participants and spectators therefore lies in its immediacy, and its ability to unify people into an authentic experience of the here and now. The men and women on the field are much more than sweaty people wearing shorts and kicking a ball—to spectators they are heroes of pure beauty.This might help us understand the strikingly and paradoxically different responses to the 2022 World Cup and the Super League. The Super League aimed to usurp the traditional structure of football to benefit big clubs over small ones, but it was perceived as a greedy affront to the purity of sport. However, fans may have been able to accept the death toll of the Qatar World Cup as a necessary sacrifice to preserve the universal, binding power of modern sport.The 1936 ‘Nazi Olympics’The pivotal moment in shaping our modern sporting ethos was the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, also known as the Nazi Olympics. The controversial event ignited a widespread boycott movement, which argued that holding and respecting the games under a fascist and antisemitic regime would tarnish sport’s purity, and vindicate the Third Reich in front of a global audience.Nevertheless, the games went ahead, giving a powerful demonstration of sport’s ability to make the world overlook unspeakable crimes. Oppressive nations today are still following its example.Ethical sporting cultureNearly a hundred years later, Qatar is a candidate to host the 2036 Olympics. Given the death toll of the 2022 World Cup, it is likely that such an event will cost the lives of thousands more workers, and it should be met with firm resistance.However, history teaches us that protests should not be based solely on general terms like “sportswashing” or cynical perspectives that overlook the emotional and tangible meaning that sport holds in people’s lives.As seen in the case of the Super League, sports fans are capable of fighting for the purity of the games they love, but such a fight for the soul of modern sports should not begin only after enjoying the summer tournaments. Ultimately, as sports fans, we should know that ethics often begin in the here and now.-The Conversation \nA year and a half after the election of the House of Representatives, the thematic committees in the federal parliament still seem to be struggling to gain momentum in their works. In this tenure of the legislature, the committees have been unable to make any impact with regard to holding the executive accountable in governance and service delivery. As House committees work in a dedicated way on certain issues, the thematic panels are considered the parliament’s workshops. But the legislative units have thus far failed to create much enthusiasm.It took the House of Representatives over one and half months to sit for the first meeting after it was elected on November 20, 2022. The lower House formed 10 thematic committees on April 28, 2023—over three and half months after the first House meeting was convened on January 9. But the committees got their chairs only at the August-end. Until then, the panels were run on an ad-hoc basis and chaired by the oldest members of the respective committees. All in all, it took nine months for the mini-parliaments to get their full shape and function in a full-fledged manner.Besides the permanent committees, the parliament forms special panels for specific purposes. For instance, the lower house formed a special committee to probe embezzlements of hundreds of billions of rupees by cooperatives. The committee’s formation helped end the weeks-long parliament obstruction by the main opposition Nepali Congress, which was demanding a panel to investigate irregularities in the cooperatives. As the special committee led by lawmaker Surya Thapa of ruling party CPN-UML begins its work, officials at the parliament secretariat have said they lack even basic resources to carry out the panel’s work. Officials said that in order to analyse financial transactions of the cooperatives, they needed support of an expert team. But, according to them, the parliament secretariat lacks a budget to hire independent experts. Though they plan to seek the central bank’s help, it’s dangerous to make the parliament so weak that it cannot even carry out its routine tasks. The panel’s plan of seeking experts’ help to analyse the transactions in a professional way sounds rational as a decision based solely on the inquiry of lawmakers in the committee, none of whom have expert accounting knowledge, might later be questioned.Only a few weeks ago the State Affairs Committee was criticised for offering NGO-sponsored meals to its members and other participants at one of its meetings. The meeting had to be abandoned midway for the same reason. Our lawmakers are often criticised for going on field studies and on-site inspections on the funding of questionable organisations. Similarly, our parliament was in the past pilloried for involving international agencies in crucial tasks such as lawmaking and other affairs where outside involvement created direct conflict of interest. It has thus become imperative for the executive to allocate sufficient budget for the legislature in order to ward off undue influence, conflict of interest and make the legislature capable of doing its basic job.  \nThe weather across the country will be generally to mostly cloudy on Wednesday.Thunder and lightning are expected in multiple locations, along with mild to moderate rain. The meteorological forecasting division has warned of heavy rainfall in several places within Koshi Bagmati, Gandaki, Lumbini, and Sudur Pashchim provinces. Additionally, a few places in Karnali Province may experience heavy rainfall. Issuing a special bulletin, the Met Office has advised residents to be prepared for varying intensities of rainfall throughout the day, with chances of very heavy rainfall at one or two places in Bagmati Province, Gandaki Province, Lumbini Province, and Sudur Pashchim Province.Meanwhile, the weather will remain generally to mostly cloudy tonight. Light to moderate rain, accompanied by thunder and lightning, is forecast in a few areas. Heavy rainfall is expected in parts of Bagmati Province, Gandaki Province, and Sudur Pashchim Province. There is also a possibility of very heavy rainfall at isolated places in Bagmati Province and Gandaki Province. The maximum temperature on Tuesday was recorded at 34.6 degrees Celsius at Dipayal, while Jomsom’s lowest recorded temperature was 16.0 degrees Celsius. \nAt least 116 people, many of them women and children, were killed in a stampede at a Hindu religious gathering in northern India on Tuesday, authorities said, in one of the country's worst such tragedies in years.The stampede happened in a village in Hathras district in Utter Pradesh, about 200 km (125 miles) southeast of the national capital New Delhi, where authorities said thousands had gathered in sweltering late afternoon temperatures.The stampede occurred when a crowd of devotees started pushing towards the stage after the event to touch the preacher, who was coming down, said Yogi Adityanath, chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous state.While the cause was not immediately clear, Hathras district administrator Ashish Kumar suggested it may have been “due to overcrowding at the time when people were trying to leave the venue”.Another senior state official, Chaitra V., told broadcaster India Today that people may have lost their footing as they sought water in the heat.“There was wet mud at one place where people may have slipped. Also because of the heat, people may have made their way to the spot where water was kept and that could have caused the incident as well,” she said, adding that 18 were injured and in hospital.Police said they had launched an investigation and promised action against anyone found to be responsible, adding that the gathering may have been larger than had been permitted.“Lapses by authorities will also be investigated and action will be taken on the basis of the report which will be available within 24 hours,” state police chief Prashant Kumar said.Video clips recorded by news agency ANI, in which Reuters has a minority stake, showed bodies piled into the back of trucks and laid out in vehicles.Purses and bags covered in dust, were heaped up at the venue, with people sitting on their haunches sifting through them to identify their belongings.Mobile phones were similarly piled together, waiting to be claimed by their owners.A video on social media showed a large crowd packed into a tented area, standing and listening to devotional tunes as they waved their hands in the direction of the religious leader who sat on a stage.It also showed some women hanging on to the bamboo poles holding up the canopy to get a better view above the heads of the large crowd.Reuters could not immediately verify the social media images.“There must have been about 50,000 people...at the gate on the highway, some people were going left and some people were going right, the stampede was caused in that confusion,” Suresh Chandra, a witness who was at the gathering, told local media.Seema, a woman who travelled from a town almost 60 km away to attend the event, said she was leaving the venue when the stampede occurred. She was accompanied by three relatives, two of whom were killed.Stampedes and other accidents involving large crowds at religious gatherings and pilgrimage sites have happened in the past and are often blamed on poor crowd management.A stampede in central India in 2013 killed 115 people, while nearly 250 died in 2008 and more than 340 were killed during an annual pilgrimage in the western state of Maharashtra in 2005, according to local media reports.Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the federal government was assisting the state and announced a compensation of 200,000 rupees ($2,400) to the families of the dead and 50,000 rupees to those injured. \nThe 15th municipal meeting of Bharatpur Metropolitan City recently endorsed its policy and programme that aims to make the metropolis clean, green, safe and prosperous. Just after a week of the municipal meeting, the streets of Bharatpur are littered with heaps of garbage, posing health risks during the monsoon.Waste management has become a major problem in Bharatpur, especially for people living near the banks of the Narayani river, as the riverside serves as the only landfill site for the city of around 370,000 people. And the problem worsens every monsoon as the metropolis disposes of its waste on the banks of the river, which is just 400 metres from Nagarban settlement, making life difficult for all local residents.According to the data of the environment section of Bharatpur Metropolitan City Office, around 70 to 80 tonnes of garbage are being collected in the metropolis daily. Garbage, both renewable and non-renewable, is being deposited on the banks of the Narayani river as the metropolis does not have a well-managed landfill site.The metropolitan city, somehow, manages the solid waste during the dry season. But both the rain-swollen river and locals obstruct the municipal authority in managing garbage during the monsoon season. The garbage trucks cannot reach the designated place as the river banks get flooded in the rainy season. As a result, the sanitation workers are compelled to dump the garbage near human settlements that trigger stringent protests from the locals.“It has been more than 20 years since the metropolis dumped garbage on the riverbank in our ward,” said Bikash Thapa, chairman of ward 3 of Bharatpur metropolis. “During the dry season, the metropolis dumps the garbage a little further from the settlement, but during the monsoon, it dumps and buries the garbage near the settlement. There is no more space left in the area for dumping and burying garbage.”The locals of ward 3 have been obstructing the metropolis from dumping garbage on the riverbank. Garbage has been piled up in the streets since Thursday due to the protest of the local people.Bharatpur metropolis is now looking for an alternative place to dump the garbage after the locals’ disruption in ward 3. “Search is on to find a suitable place in ward 1 to manage the garbage,” said Suraj Paudel, chief at the sanitation management unit of Bharatpur Metropolitan City. According to him, the metropolis and two private companies have been collecting and managing the solid waste currently.The metropolis has been dumping its garbage on the banks of Narayani river for the past 15 years after the then Hetauda Appellate Court issued an order banning the disposal of waste at Jaldevi Community Forest, stating its biological importance. Since then, Bharatpur has been dumping its waste on the Narayani riverbanks, which is just 200-300 metres away from the city area.The federal government in the fiscal year 2011-12 had allotted 15 bigha of land in the Jaldevi Community Forest to the metropolitan city to build a well-managed landfill site. As compensation for the use of the forestland, the metropolis some five years ago had purchased another 15 bighas (10 hectares) of land in Madi to be used for reforestation. But the Division Forest Office in Bharatpur in 2023 refused to swap forest land with the land that the metropolis purchased in Madi as that land does not adjoin the national forest. As a result, the metropolitan city’s plan to construct a landfill site remains in limbo.“We have been seriously working on garbage management,” said Mayor Renu Dahal in a press meet organised to conclude the municipal meeting last week. “We are yet to get results despite working sincerely for the construction of a well managed landfill site.” The metropolis allocates a Rs50 million budget to manage garbage for the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25.Bharatpur, one of the country’s six metropolitan cities, is still struggling to find a location for the landfill site. In 2018, the metropolitan office signed an agreement with the Sudokwon Landfill Site Management Corporation of South Korea to come up with a master plan for a proper waste management system. The masterplan was to be prepared within 15 months from the date of the agreement.“The agreement was signed for the proper waste management of the city. We thought that the Korean company would come with the master plan,” said Dahal, assuring that an alternative landfill site will be sought soon to initiate construction work. “But the company did not work citing the Covid-19 pandemic. The metropolis is now working itself for the sustainable management of solid waste.” \nA stampede at a Hindu religious gathering in Uttar Pradesh, India, has claimed the lives of at least 87 people, with the death toll expected to rise.\nCPN-UML urges PM Dahal to resign for a new government formation with KP Sharma Oli as leader and Dahal resisting the request with plans for a trust vote.\nPresident Ramchandra Paudel appointed Suresh Adhikari from Sankhuwasabha as the Secretary of the House of Representatives on the recommendation of Speaker Devraj Ghimire.\nAstrological predictions for different zodiac signs, emphasizing the impact of emotions, relationships, and self-care, with warnings about potential conflicts and a need for self-awareness.\nPolitical interference has led to frequent and controversial ambassadorial appointments in Nepal, with half being political appointees and the other half chosen from career diplomats.\nOn March 15 last year, China reopened its borders for travel, ending a three-year closure during the Covid pandemic. As soon as the borders—land and air—opened, and the China-funded international airport in Pokhara was inaugurated, optimism was high. Before the pandemic, market insiders predicted a dramatic surge in Chinese tourists, who were Nepal’s second-largest source market after India before the Covid-19 pandemic. It didn’t happen. Nepal received 60,878 Chinese tourists in 2023, a recovery by a third from the pre-pandemic level when Chinese tourists boomed in Nepal.In the first five months (January–May) of this year, Nepal received 46,671 Chinese, with the highest arrival of 12,093 recorded in March. While Chinese arrivals slowed, Indian tourists boomed in Nepal, reaching an all-time high of 319,936 individuals, according to the Department of Immigration. Among Indians, only those who come by air are counted as tourists in Nepal. In the first five months, Nepal has received 148,861 Indian tourists, the highest number of 38,288 recorded in May. Before the pandemic, India and China were competing neck-to-neck. Now, there is a huge imbalance between the south and north.Will it change? On Monday, during the 16th round of the Nepal-China diplomatic consultation mechanism meeting held in Kathmandu, Beijing made a surprise announcement.It announced plans to promote Nepali tourism in China as part of celebrating 2025 as ‘Visit Nepal Year in China’, which Nepal’s top travel trade entrepreneurs say is a “big statement.” They say they had never before heard China favour any country with such soft power diplomacy.Will 2025 be the year for the potential great return of Chinese tourists then? “So far, I haven’t heard or seen Beijing promote any country’s tourism inside China. This is, in fact, a good gesture of neighbourliness,” said Kishore Raj Pandey, chairman of Saathi Nepal Travel and Tours, who was the first person to bring Chinese tourists to Nepal in 2001.“If it has been announced, Beijing indeed has some policy to encourage Chinese citizens to travel to Nepal.”Tourism is vital for Nepal’s economy. According to the recently released annual World Travel and Tourism Council research report, Nepal’s tourism sector generated Rs327.9 billion ($2.5 billion) in revenue and supported 1.19 million jobs directly and indirectly last year. The report forecasts that Nepal will generate 1.22 million jobs in 2024. Last year, the country received 1 million tourists.Some critics say it’s a lofty promise. Before Monday’s meeting, during the third Nepal Investment Summit held in Kathmandu on April 28, Luo Zhaohui, chairman of the China International Development Cooperation Agency, announced the waiver of visa fees for Nepalis.It was implemented on May 1. There was another announcement, too.“The Chinese government is making arrangements to start new flights from China to Nepal’s two new international airports—Pokhara and Lumbini,” Luo said while addressing the summit.Nepal’s $216 million international airport in Pokhara, the country’s tourism capital, opened in January last year. Beijing financed it.Similarly, Nepal’s second international airport in Bhairahawa, built by Chinese contractors, started operating in May 2022 after four years of construction delays. The objectives of both projects are to decentralise economic activities in the new federal setup, attract more tourists, and prevent Nepalis from going abroad.But only some international flights are operating in the two new shiny airports.“Under Beijing's renewed diplomacy, there is a possibility of the operation of these two new international airports,” said Basant Raj Mishra, a senior tourism entrepreneur. “Once flights from China come, it will create competition.”He said Beijing’s announcement represents a great opportunity for Nepal. “We should be prepared for joint marketing and promotional activities. With a proper policy, we can attract 1 million tourists from China alone in 2025. And for this, we need enhanced flight connectivity.”China is facing many economic obstacles, but Beijing remains optimistic about growth.Reports show that Chinese tourists hit the road in significant numbers during the recent five-day Labor holidays in May but kept a tight grip on their wallets, reflecting still-weak sentiment in the world’s second-largest economy.According to a statement from China’s Ministry of Culture and Tourism, travellers made 28.2 percent more trips, but spending only rose 13.5 percent from the 2019 break. “Of all the countries, China has the largest number of airlines connecting Nepal but brings the lowest number of tourists,” said Vijay Shrestha, vice president (Administration) at Himalaya Airlines, the Nepal-Tibet joint venture. There are five airlines currently connecting China. “The traffic is low,” said Shrestha. “It may be due to low consumer confidence.”Himalaya Airlines has suspended Kathmandu-Beijing flights, and Kathmandu-Shanghai flights are also irregular due to low passenger traffic. Besides, in the other three sectors, the average occupancy is 40 percent,” said Shrestha. “The announcement from Beijing to promote Nepal in China could change that.”Nepal and China established formal diplomatic relations in 1955, and Nepal-Tibet trade goes a long way back. In 1956, four cities of Tibet, namely Lhasa, Shigatse, Gyantse, and Yatung, were designated as major trading cities for Nepali traders.Between the founding of the People’s Republic of China in 1949 and 1982, few residents of China travelled to foreign destinations other than government officials, students, and a few businessmen. In 1983, China allowed citizens from Guangdong Province to travel to the British colony of Hong Kong on organised tours to visit family.Beginning in 1995, the Chinese National Tourism Administration formalised China’s Approved Destination Status (ADS) policy.The history of Chinese tourism in Nepal is not long either. Nepal first participated in the China International Travel Fair in 2000 to promote its tourism sector. Before 2000, the Chinese could only travel to Nepal on official visits.The Chinese government had permitted ADS for Chinese outbound travellers in November 2001. The two countries signed an initial memorandum of understanding on an implementation plan for outbound travel by Chinese people to Nepal on April 16, 2001, laying the groundwork for the ADS.Nepal was given the Approved Destination Status (ADS) by its northern neighbour in 2002, and in June of the same year, Chinese citizens began visiting Nepal officially for the first time as tourists. Nepal was the 18th nation to receive the status and first in South Asia. In 2002, Nepal got 8,715 Chinese tourists.Subsequently, the central banks of the two countries signed an agreement on bilateral cooperation that allowed the Chinese currency to be converted into Nepali rupees in a bid to boost bilateral trade, tourism, and economic cooperation.However, immediately after Nepal received the ADS, arrivals from China fell due to a violent conflict that intensified over 2002-2004, reaching Nepal’s main cities and tourist destinations. Nepal eventually started witnessing a constant growth in Chinese arrivals after June 2009.Chinese arrivals to Nepal crossed the 100,000 mark for the first time in 2013, mainly due to the improved air links between the two countries. According to the tourism ministry’s statistics, around 93 percent of Chinese tourists were first-time visitors to Nepal.In 2014, Nepal received 123,805 Chinese visitors.The 2015 earthquake and India's blockade led to arrivals from China dropping to a four-year low of 64,675 individuals in 2015, down 47.76 percent from 2014.The surface road at the Tatopani border point, where Nepal used to receive many Chinese tourists, was also blocked.On December 25, 2015, Nepal announced ‘free visa’ for Chinese tourists, giving them the same treatment accorded to South Asian visitors. In a bid to revive flagging arrivals, the scheme was implemented in January 2016.Thereon, tourist arrivals from China started rising steadily, and Nepal saw the strongest growth, 46.8 percent, in tourist arrivals from China, with the overall number reaching 153,633 visitors in 2018.In 2019, Nepal received a record 169,543 Chinese tourists.The number fell to 19,257 in 2020. In 2021 and 2022, there were 6,198 and 9,599 Chinese tourists in Nepal—mainly diplomats and those stranded in third countries—who came to Nepal when Beijing enforced never-ending lockdowns.When the Chinese economy started to boom again, Nepali investors pumped money into luxury hotels, which too have multiplied. \nLast month, a local from Sindhupalchowk district was brought to Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital to treat a snakebite. Along with the victim, relatives brought the live snake in a bottle to show the doctor as proof.“The snake was a king cobra,” said Dr Yuba Nidhi Basaula, director at the Hospital. “Fortunately, the venom had not penetrated deep into the victim’s body, and after three days of treatment, the victim was discharged. We called a snake handler and handed over the king cobra.”Sindhupalchowk is a mountain district where venomous snakes were thought of as non-existent. However, incidents of king cobra bites in mountain districts like Sindhupalchowk suggest that venomous snakes have started migrating towards hill and mountain districts, and rising temperatures caused by climate change are the main culprit, experts say.Nepal is among the world’s most vulnerable countries to the climate crisis and has witnessed multiple extreme weather events over the past decade and a half.Evidence suggests that maximum temperatures in Nepal are rising at a faster rate of 0.056 degrees Celsius a year, compared to the global average rise of 0.03 degrees Celsius a year. Compared to districts of the Tarai region, those in hills and mountains have been witnessing a more rapid increase in daytime maximum temperatures, which could have helped venomous snakes survive there, experts say.“Not only in Sindhupalchowk, but a king cobra bite was also spotted in Godawari of Lalitpur district last year,” said Basaula. “Snakebite cases have started rising alarmingly of late.”Of the 31 patients admitted to the hospital on Sunday, 16—more than 50 percent—were snakebite cases. Doctors at the hospital say eight to ten snakebite victims seek treatment there every day, and most victims seeking care at the hospital are from the districts of Kathmandu Valley or from those adjoining the Valley.Each year, around 2,700 people, mostly children and women from Nepal’s Tarai region, die of snakebites, according to a March 2022 report published in The Lancet, a leading international medical journal.However, snakebite cases are vastly underreported in the country. The Ministry of Health and Population said that only 14 deaths and 1,220 cases of snakebites had been reported in 11 months of the current fiscal year. Officials admit that venomous snakebite incidents are being reported from hill and mountain districts, and the demand for anti-snake venom is on the rise. They attribute this rise in snakebite incidents to rising temperatures. “Health facilities in some mountainous and hilly districts—like Darchula and Bajura—have asked for anti-snake venom,” said Dr Hemanta Chandra Ojha, an official at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Snakebite incidents have been on the rise,” said Dr Hemanta Chandra Ojha, an official at the division. “With the onset of the monsoon, people living in the risk areas should remain vigilant.”Every year, the Health Ministry purchases around 25,000 vials of anti-snake venom and distributes them to around 100 snakebite treatment centres in the country.Officials say as snakebite cases surge, so will the demand for additional treatment centres. “This year, we are planning to set up an additional 15 snakebite treatment centres,” said Ojha. Public health experts have urged authorities to launch an awareness drive about the risks. They say people living in thatched-roof houses are particularly vulnerable to snakebites, as snakes often enter such homes in search of rats. They say people should be asked to keep their homes and surroundings clean, prevent children from playing in bushy areas, avoid venturing out at night, and use torchlights while walking in the dark.Likewise, women and children who have to work in fields and go to the jungle are at the highest risk of snakebites. Small children are at risk of dying from snakebites, as they do not tell their parents about the bites on time due to fear of getting scolded for playing in the bushes, according to doctors.“We should make people aware so that they seek medical attention immediately after a snakebite, using whatever means of transport they get,” said Ojha. “The faster you reach the hospital, the greater your chances of survival.” \nThe duel between Kathmandu’s 34-year-old mayor Balendra Shaha (popularly called Balen), a structural engineer, reputed rapper and political novice, and 72-year-old Khagda Prasad Sharma Oli, a high school dropout, two-time prime minister, political veteran and chairperson of the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist) is a caricature of contemporary Nepali politics marred by the conflict between the old and the young. The duel has attracted numerous newspaper articles, set social media on fire and provided YouTubers a field day. What is Oli’s motive in mobilising his whole party to attack Balen, and what is Balen—a lone man with no political experience and political following—doing picking a fight with Oli? How will the duel impact Oli’s party and Balen’s aspirations going forward? The fightThe Balen-Oli fight began when the metropolitan city started to clear buildings built illegally on municipal land or business advertisements that did not comply with municipal regulations. The city would order the current occupants of the offending buildings or business owners to comply with the law and vacate the premises. In most cases, the occupants would ignore the order. Like in old times, they relied on their political connections to continue to subvert the law. However, that did not work with Balen. He sent municipal forces to demolish the encroachment and non-compliant adverts. The first property subjected to the mayor's action belonged to someone connected to the UML. Soon after the clearance, a Central Committee member of the UML, Mahesh Basnet, called upon his minions to physically harm Balen if he did not “mend his ways”.Balen’s attempt to clean up Kathmandu from squatters occupying public land, particularly river banks, intensified the conflict. Oli publicly mocked Balen for using bulldozers to demolish plastic shades built by “poor squatters.” Some “squatters” are believed to occupy multistory buildings constructed on public land and own businesses worth millions of rupees. The majority of them are UML voters, “UMLs’ vote bank”, observed a Balen supporter. The squatter problem is not new. All previous governments, including the one led by Oli, recognised it. The conflict became increasingly acrimonious when Balen opened the basement of Dharahara for car parking. The government objected, arguing that the reconstruction of Dharahara is still incomplete and the car park is unsafe to use. Balen retorted, “Dharahara was inaugurated as a completed project by Prime Minister Oli before the last election. How can it be incomplete?” The inauguration of the work-in-progress was one of Prime Minister Oli’s pre-election charades. The car park is safe and currently in use; the reconstruction continues. The recent New Road imbroglio added fuel to the fire. Balen started widening the footpath on New Road to comply with the standards set by the Nepal Department of Roads (NDR). A local ward chair, a UML member, objected and complained to the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport headed by Deputy Prime Minister Ragubhir Mahaseth, an Oli acolyte. The NDR, which reports to Mahaseth, issued a “stop work” order. Incensed, Balen asked Oli to expeditiously arrange repayment for those who cheated the so-called Giri Bandhu Tea Estate land plotting scandal. Oli’s apparatchiks compared Balen to “a puppy” (a good-for-nothing weakling) and chastised him for maligning “our respected Chairman”. Oli himself has described Balen as a “bubble” which will fizzle out in no time. The fightersOli is old, witty, foxy, prickly, intolerant of criticism and, like all other politicians, corrupt in the public eye. As enunciated during his premiership, his vision of economic development includes building view towers, providing Kathmandu households with piped gas within six months, and building facilities for maritime trade—the latter two unachievable pipe dreams or political ploys. Balen is young, angry, ambitious, audacious, brash, bold, impulsive, focussed and untainted by corruption. His vision for Kathmandu is to make it a clean, functioning, beautiful heritage city. In about two years since he became mayor, Kathmandu has become relatively cleaner and greener. Its roads are rid of perpetual potholes; its sidewalks are walkable; teaching standards in public schools have improved; private schools who were short-changing on paying taxes have been forced to pay their share; emergency ambulance service has become more dependable, and so on. All of the above, despite a lack of support from political parties and the government. Parties do not support him because his success will spotlight their past failures. Despite the odds, his accomplishments have made him hugely popular throughout the country. “If we have ten leaders like Balen, we can change the country,” an exuberant Kathmandu taxi driver told me. Even the international press has taken note of Balen’s leadership. The New York Times published a story on Balen last year. He was named one of the 100 upcoming leaders in 2023 by the internationally known Time Magazine, published in the US. Balen’s public support is so visceral that he gets away even with outrageous comments like “burning Singha Durbar’, Nepal’s central secretariat, the office of Nepal’s Ministries, and irrelevant dragging of Oli into the “Giri Bandhu Tea Estate” scandal, and other similar outbursts. Although the overwhelming support for such comments on social media is surprising, it is indicative of the intensity of public dislike of established politicians.The future Balen knows that he owes his popularity as much to his performance as his refusal to bow down to political pressure and to stay clean from corruption scandals. In the two years since he assumed office, he has given confidence to the city dwellers that with exemplary leadership, the city and the country can be changed. His future depends on whether he can continue to ignore political pressure and demonstrate his perseverance, will, guts and vision to turn chaotic Kathmandu into a livable metropolis. As for Oli, UML lost the last election in Kathmandu because its mayor, a UML member, was a dismal failure. The confrontation with Balen for political upmanship and ego inflation will unlikely win Kathmandu for him. Cooperation may work better than confrontation.    \nThe Rastriya Swatantra Party's General Secretary emphasizes collaboration with independent forces like Balen Shah and Gopi Hamal instead of established politicians due to differences in working styles and public dissatisfaction.\nMain events succinctly summarized, retaining key details.\nKey events unfold, shaping the course of events and impacting the lives of those involved.\nSri Lanka, despite financial struggles, showcases its diverse attractions, including ancient irrigation systems, and is experiencing a tourism resurgence.\nEducation in Every Home’s report titled ‘Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in Nepal’s Textbooks’ highlights the lack of diversity, inclusivity, and inaccuracies in these textbooks.  The findings include egregious mistakes in textbooks like the inclusion of a letter Abraham Lincloln supposedly wrote—dating to a time 17 years after his assassination, to assertions like Brazil has tigers, elephants and rhinos while Germany has tigers and monkeys. The books display a clear bias in favour of Brahmin Chhetri males, while women make up just 18 percent of all people profiled. While 80 percent of all bylines are male, the presence of marginalised communities, especially Dalits, is nearly non-existent.  \nIs the portrayal of a woman in a position of power inherently feminist? This question struck me when I visited the Siddhartha Art Gallery's latest exhibition featuring Kalighat paintings. I found myself amused and conflicted by one piece, ‘Babu and Bibi II,’ in which a bourgeois woman holds a leash attached to a dog with a man's head. In today's art world, feminism has become a buzzword—from discussions in my homeland of Cyprus to my university classrooms in the US and now here in Kathmandu. Yet, beyond the surface-level rhetoric of ‘feminism’ and ‘equality’, deeper conversations often reveal these concepts' ambiguity and diverse interpretations. Feminism means something different to everyone, even within the same progressive circles.Siddhartha Art Gallery’s exhibition places three story-telling art forms in conversation with one another: Patachitra, Bilampau, and Kalighat paintings. Patachitra is the original art form from which folk artists deviated to invent the Bilampau and Kalighat styles. This is one of the most unique aspects of the exhibition; by placing all three styles alongside one another, visitors can see the evolution of folk art as it travelled across South Asia. Bilampau paintings result from the Patachitra tradition of crossing from India into Nepal, and Kalighat is the product of the migration of Patachitra artists to Kolkata. All three art styles share certain narrative and symbolic attributes. When stepping into the gallery, the Kalighat paintings stand out the most as they differ quite from Patachitra and Bilampau in style and subject matter. Unlike the other two painting styles, these paintings depict a scene with only one or two characters and have no background details. Nepali Bilampau narrative scrolls differ from Patachitra in that they tell a story from left to right rather than vertically. Apart from the direction of the narrative, Bilampau and Patachitra paintings are largely similar in featured stories and style. Before stepping into the exhibition, I hadn’t encountered Kalighat paintings, but their depiction of women immediately captured my attention. These small-scale artworks defy conventional gender roles, blending humour with a sharp critique of their time's moral and social norms. What drew my interest was that the artists' intentions are almost completely left to the imagination.Diving into the context of Kalighat paintings sheds some light on their potentially intended messages and whether they can be dubbed as ‘feminist’ or not. These paintings trace directly back to the goddess Kali, often called the ‘mother Goddess’.Kali destroys evil to protect the innocent and is associated with power, change, deviance, and time—all traits that result in her depictions being strongly connected to feminism.The Kalighat art style was born around a temple dedicated to the Goddess Kali, the Kalighat temple, in 19th-century Kolkata (then Calcutta). Folk ‘patua’ artists migrated to the city, near the Kalighat temple, as it became a trade centre in colonial India.These artists were trained in Patachitra narrative scroll paintings, which were several feet long and contained some narrative scenes.Once the folk ‘patua’ artists moved to Kolkata, many saw an opportunity in the popularity of the Kalighat temple.Shifting away from their narrative scrolls, they began to use their artistic skills to produce portable depictions of the Goddess Kali and other deities for people to take home as religious souvenirs. It didn’t take long for these ‘Kalighat paintings’ to grow in popularity, and the art style emerged as a distinct art genre.These initial versions of Kalighat paintings can also be seen in the Siddhartha Art Gallery’s new exhibition, such as a beautiful piece depicting Krishna playing the flute for Radha and a piece named ‘Kalighat Kali’.The second phase of these paintings is where the scenes become more interesting and potentially controversial. In the mid-1900s, Kalighat artists moved away from solely religious characters and began using their paintings as an active means of subversion.Their paintings focused on the pretensions of the ‘Babu culture’—the Westernised, upper-class Bengali men who adopted European mannerisms and fashions.The influence of British colonialism on gender roles and Babus and Bibis in Bengal cannot be understated.As Western ideas and practices permeated Bengali society, traditional gender roles were challenged and reinterpreted. Kalighat artists navigated these shifts with astute observation and artistic flair, capturing the tension between tradition and Western modernity concepts.The Babus and Bibis featured in each painting are distinctive in their dress and jewellery, which are always lavish and influenced by European culture. What may be first noticed in Siddhartha’s current collection is that Babus also nearly always have a long, thin moustache, while Bibis are voluptuous and wear relatively revealing clothing.These caricatures entertained the public and served as cautionary tales, warning against the pitfalls of excess and moral decay caused by opulence.British colonial officers were also sometimes depicted in humorous anti-colonial scenes. Kalighat artists became widely known for their keen sense of humour and a sharp eye for social satire.Multiple artists or whole families often made these artworks, each member performing a specific task such as paper preparation, outlining, or shading. Most importantly, the artists never signed their works or gave their works titles, meaning that the exact origins and intended meanings of the depicted scenes are not specified for the viewers.In other words, each work that a visitor sees in the gallery’s exhibition, or any other collection, has been given a title by the curator rather than the artists behind the work.Therefore, even though the chosen expressions and positioning in each painting always tell a story, the artist's intended message is left up to interpretation, which can be wildly misleading in many cases.In some Kalighat artworks featured in the exhibition, we can see where the artist’s intended meaning and the later given title potentially drastically conflict. For example, a painting labelled ‘Bibi with her pets’ features Bibi sitting on a chair with a snake, tiger and bull at her feet.Since the bull and tiger are depicted drinking from the same dish, this scene could be referencing a Bengali saying, “baghe-gorute ek ghate jol khaowa,” which roughly translates to “a person/force so powerful, they can make a tiger and a cow drink water from the same source.”This image of a woman overlooking a cow and a tiger drinking together peacefully directly suggests that the woman is incredibly powerful and is possibly a loose reference to the Goddess Kali. Contradictorily, the painting’s later-assigned title subtly demeans the seated woman.By dubbing these animals as ‘pets’, the perception of the painting is transformed, and her position in the chair becomes one of leisure, aimlessness, and materialism.Another key example of the range of meaning that could be taken away from these paintings is ‘Babu and Bibi IV’. In this work, Babu is seen kneeling at Bibi’s feet while Bibi looks down on Babu, holds her hair and steps on his clothing.On the one hand, this scene could be interpreted as the normalisation of women being in positions of power in a relationship, conversely suggesting that men do not need to subscribe to hyper-masculine ideals.On the other hand, the scene could be mocking men who do not follow the patriarchy and demeaning them for allowing their wives to subordinate them. Depending on which interpretation you choose to take from each work featured in the exhibition or what title it is given, Kalighat paintings can result in contradictory narratives about feminism.‘Babu and Bibi IV’ is one of many paintings in the exhibition where women are depicted with agency and independence, challenging traditional patriarchal norms in both Indian and colonial societies.This subversion of gender norms within the paintings can be seen as a form of resistance against the influence of European culture on Bengali society. At the same time, considering that this art style originated from depictions of the Goddess Kali, one can see how the artists’ intentions may have been leaning towards women's empowerment rather than the satirising of men who did not follow masculine ideals.Despite the seemingly open-ended intentions of the Kalighat artists, they certainly used Kalighat paintings to produce visual commentaries on the evolving social landscape shaped by colonial pressures and indigenous responses.The exhibition offers an unmissable visual exploration of the evolution of the patachitra tradition in Bengali society. Through these artworks, viewers are given a glimpse into a time of cultural flux and social upheaval, where artists boldly challenge prevailing norms and ideologies through their works.As the world continues to evolve, Kalighat paintings resonate as a testament to the enduring power of art to provoke, inspire, and expose the human experience. \nThe parliamentary special committee investigating the embezzlement of depositors’ funds by various cooperatives on Tuesday decided to correspond with political parties with national status, seeking their suggestions on how to resolve the cooperative crisis.The panel made the decision after discussing issues related to the cooperative sector with officials from the National Cooperative Federation, the Savings and Credit Central Cooperative Association and the National Cooperative Bank Limited.Surya Thapa, the coordinator of the committee, said the meeting decided to correspond with political parties with national status in the House of Representatives, requesting written suggestions for resolving issues related to the misappropriation of funds and the return of savings to depositors.The meeting of the committee on Sunday decided to ask for documents from 20 cooperatives that were declared problematic by the government.Earlier, the committee, at its meeting on June 26, had decided to seek documents from cooperatives that transferred funds to Gorkha Media Network.Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai, the chairman of the media house, is accused of embezzling hundreds of millions of rupees in collusion with different cooperatives in Kaski, Chitwan, and Butwal. Rai is currently on the run.After weeks of negotiations between the ruling and opposition parties, a seven-member committee led by CPN-UML lawmaker Thapa was constituted on May 28 to investigate the embezzlement of deposits in dozens of cooperatives around the country.As per the committee’s jurisdiction as defined in its terms of reference, the committee will investigate the crisis-ridden cooperatives, their legal and institutional purposes, financial systems, regulatory arrangements, supervision and transparency, and make recommendations to the government.Another task is to recommend measures for the immediate return of savings to the depositors of the problematic cooperatives identified by the Department of Cooperatives and the Crisis-ridden Cooperatives Management Committee.The probe panel was formed after the main opposition Nepali Congress disrupted parliamentary proceedings for over two months demanding such a body be constituted to investigate cooperative scams.The issue got complicated as Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane, who is the chair of the Rastriya Swatantra Party, is also accused of misusing the money from various cooperatives. Lamichhane was managing director of Gorkha Media Network before joining politics. \nNepali Congress once again has reiterated that Nepal is not interested in loan funding of Belt and Road Initiatives (BRI) projects. Party spokesperson Parkash Saran Mahat said that after a meeting of the party's office bearers and former office bearers on Monday, the party concluded that Nepal should only accept grants, not loans for implementing BRI projects. “The debt burden is already high, so the party has decided that further debt should not be taken for implementing BRI projects,” he said. During the 16th round of the Nepal-China diplomatic consultation mechanism meeting, held on June 25 in Kathmandu, the two parties had planned to finalise the BRI implementation plan, but they could not agree on the modality for financing projects. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Nepal corresponded with the Prime Minister’s Office to seek approval for signing the implementation plan during the diplomatic consultation mechanism meeting attended by Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong, but it failed. The Congress, however, has been vocal in advocating for grants to implement BRI projects. During the Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi’s Nepal visit in March 2022, then Prime Minister Deuba had conveyed that Nepal would not implement BRI projects through loans. Congress leaders also said that President Sher Bahadur Deuba, during his meeting with CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli at the latter’s residence in Balkot on Saturday, discussed the funding modality of BRI. The Congress, which is the largest party in Parliament, held a gathering of its sitting and former office bearers on Monday following Saturday’s meeting between party chief Deuba and UML chair Oli. While the meeting between Deuba and Oli sparked speculations about the two parties potentially cooperating to form a government, the Congress leaders, after Monday’s meeting, dismissed such a possibility anytime soon. Congress spokesman Mahat categorically denied that the issue of Congress-UML collaboration on the government was discussed at Monday’s meeting. But he did not rule out the possibility of the two parties coming together in the future. Mahat outlined the conditions under which the two largest parties in the parliament could potentially collaborate: a stable and effective government, resolution of election-related challenges, and a clear path towards national stability and prosperity. “The Congress party believes that political issues should take precedence over the government’s role,” Mahat said. “On cooperation, our party is open to cooperating with all parties on pressing national issues.”He also said that the party is in discussion not just with the UML, but also with other parties for possible cooperation.However, a close ally of Deuba claimed that during the Saturday meeting, Deuba proposed Oli as the prime minister for the first round should the two parties cooperate to form a new government.  “As far as I know, Deuba is not in the mood to be prime minister at the moment,” the Congress leader who was present at the office bearer and former office bearer meeting on Monday told the Post. “In such circumstances, if two parties come together to form a government, Oli would lead it first.” A government of the two parties might be formed, but not in the next few days, said the Congress leader. Similarly, the Congress meeting on Monday also decided to extend the tenures of its sister organisation by six months. Their terms were expiring on July 4. “Today’s meeting decided to extend the terms of the sister organisations so that they can elect new office bearers within six months,” Jeevan Pariyar, the Deputy General Secretary of the party, told the Post. Meanwhile, Pariyar also said that the meeting decided to send the report of the party’s Mahasamiti meeting in February to the central committee for approval with amendments. During the Mahasamiti meeting, Vice-President Purna Bahadur Khadka had presented a policy document, General Secretary Gagan Thapa had proposed organisational reforms, General Secretary Bishwa Parkash Sharma had presented a document on contemporary political issues, and spokesperson Prakash Sharan Mahat a document on the economic situation, prospects and future direction. General Secretary Thapa's proposal drew controversy within the party. In it, he urged the party to contest the upcoming election on its own strength without forming any electoral alliance. Later, on March 4, the CPN (Maoist Centre) ditched its collaboration with the Congress and brought the UML into the government. The party pointed to Thapa’s proposal as a reason for a change in the ruling coalition.  \nCPN-UML leader K.P. Sharma Oli and Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba have agreed to form a new government with Oli as the prime minister for a year and a half, followed by Deuba, as part of a power-sharing arrangement that includes constitutional amendments and a review of the electoral system.\nKathmandu Metropolitan City intensifies dengue prevention efforts by destroying mosquito breeding grounds and raising awareness amidst rising cases in Nepal.\nKathmandu Metropolitan City provides mental health screening training to healthcare providers to enhance timely diagnosis and treatment for urban residents with mental health issues.\nKathmandu Mayor Balendra Shah and Deputy Mayor Sunita Dangol's harmonious relationship has been questioned after Dangol criticized Shah's behavior and remarks regarding road expansion plans, accusing him of undermining the institution's reputation and lacking respect for different perspectives.\nA police officer, Ajit Gole, was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound in the washroom of the federal parliament building in Kathmandu.\nPolice on Friday arrested two people from Thimi of Bhaktapur for allegedly mining cryptocurrency.The Central Investigation Bureau took 50-year-old Biswas Gurung and Rajendra Tahamata, 25, into custody in connection with the crime, said Hobindra Bogati, spokesperson for the bureau.The duo allegedly ran mining operations from the CTEVT’s information technology lab using a server and 64 desktops, on which blockchain applications were found during a preliminary investigation. Further investigation into the matter is underway. \nIn 2019-20, Nepal imported 236 units of passenger electric vehicles (EVs) from China worth some Rs674 million. In the past five years, imports of EVs from China jumped 35 times, suggesting EV adoption in Nepal is now outpacing that of conventional combustion vehicles which use engines that burn fossil fuels, such as petrol or diesel. The EVs have overtaken conventional combustion vehicles.The imports of fossil fuel-consuming passenger vehicles were 10,310 units worth Rs9.24 billion in 2019-20. After four years, in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, imports of conventional combustion vehicles were down to 3,537 units worth Rs4.21 billionHowever, overall vehicle imports have jumped from Rs65.02 billion in 2019-20 to Rs80 billion in the first 11 months of 2023-24.According to the Department of Customs, Nepal imported 11,466 units of EVs worth Rs29 billion in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, or by mid-June. The imports were 3,870 units worth Rs11.23 billion in the same period last fiscal year. Of the total EV imports, a third came from China. Customs data show that Nepal imported 7,931 units of EVs from China, accounting for 69 percent of the total EV imports in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year. This translates to Rs21 billion in value.After China, the majority of EVs were imported from India. In the review period, imports from India amounted to Rs6 billion, or 3,277 units. Until the last fiscal year, India was Nepal’s top EV supplier.The data show that Nepal imported 2,205 EVs worth Rs5.94 billion from India in the last fiscal year. In the same period, imports from China were 1,269 units worth Rs3.75 billion.Nepal’s imports of EVs jumped sharply by 158.23 percent in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year. Importers say BYD, a Chinese multinational, has taken over the Nepali market. The government collected revenue of Rs13.06 billion from the import of EVs in the review period.Akash Golchha, senior vice president of the Nepal Automobile Dealers Association, said the ongoing economic slowdown has not stopped Nepalis from buying EVs. However, petrol or diesel-run vehicle sales could have been better.EV sales and orders saw a dramatic surge before the budget was announced on May 28. Cimex Inc Pvt Ltd, the authorised distributor of BYD Auto Industry Co Ltd in Nepal, said it had achieved a milestone by delivering 50 cutting-edge BYD EVs in a single day on May 18. According to the company, all 50 units were sold from its service centre at Guheshwari, Kathmandu.According to Cimex, the company imported 4,000 EVs in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year. The import of Chinese EVs is high due to their larger production compared to India, said the company, which is among the top EV brands in Nepal.BYD’s Atto and Dolphin are the most preferred models among Nepali customers. With the recent hike in excise and customs duties, the company said the new price list of BYDs will be unveiled soon.“There was fear among buyers that the government may raise duty on EVs in the budget. As a result, the demand surged dramatically,” said Golchha. “The high import increased the stock of EVs.”Automobile dealers said that the government hiked the duty on EVs by 10 percent in the budget for the coming fiscal year 2024-25, which, however, may not impact the sales.Golchha said the government did not make drastic changes in the import duty of EVs in the budget, which may help EV sales boom in the coming days. “The EV demand will grow at a faster pace.”Auto dealers say the import boost for EVs is mainly due to banks’ easy financing. Banks lend up to 90 percent of the vehicle’s cost.Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun, in the annual budget for the upcoming fiscal year, revised the customs and excise duty rates on the import of EVs. The customs duty on EVs of up to 50 kW has been increased to 15 percent from 10 percent, while a 5 percent excise duty has been imposed on them.Likewise, the government increased the customs and excise duties on EVs of 50-100 kW by 5 percent. As per the revised tariffs, the customs duty has been increased to 20 percent from 15 percent, while the excise duty has been increased to 15 percent from 10 percent.The customs duty on 100-200 kW has been raised to 30 percent from 20 percent. Similarly, those in categories 200-300 kW and more than 300 KW will be subject to customs duty of 60 percent and 80 percent, respectively. In these vehicles, the indirect tax has been raised by 20 percent each.According to EV traders, the market is flooded with various EV models, features, and looks, and customers have options to select according to their needs. They said that EVs ranging from Rs4 million to Rs5.5 million have a large customer base, while high-priced EVs are also seeing good sales.EV traders said that despite the market slowdown, the EV sector has not been affected.“One interesting emerging trend is that people who already own conventional combustion vehicles are also buying EVs,” said Golchha. \nSeven Star International Travel and Tours has officially launched its website, www.esevenstar.com, an online travel platform featuring modern services for its customers. The website was launched on June 27, amidst a programme. The company said that the new modern travel platform has been launched using its decade-long experience in the field. Shiva Sharma Bastola, the company's managing director, said, “We have launched our very own OTA (Online Travel Agency). This is part of the company's effort to be linked to globalisation.” “With this launch, we now have access to the global market, and our goal is to reach customers all across the world.” The company said it would provide 24/7 services through the new platform. \nAs the monsoon gains traction, the price of vegetables has soared drastically in the Kathmandu valley, pushing up kitchen costs.Daily essentials like ginger, green chillies, tomatoes and potatoes are becoming prohibitively expensive for ordinary people.Traders say that production dropped due to low rainfall during the pre-monsoon (March-May) period. And with heavy rainfall in the last few weeks, floods and landslides have disrupted the supply chain. Before spring, the winter drought also reduced the output, vegetable traders say. Vegetable prices have gone up steadily in the past few months. According to the macroeconomic report of Nepal Rastra Bank, the country’s central bank, vegetable prices, as measured by the consumer price index, were up 23.11 percent in mid-May.Tomatoes, potatoes, onions, cauliflower, cowpeas, French beans, bitter gourd, smooth gourd, squash, okara, leafy vegetables, button mushrooms, broccoli, lime, chilli green, capsicum, and cucumbers became pricier within a month.Binay Shrestha, information officer at the Kalimati Fruits and Vegetable Market Development Board, the country’s largest vegetable trading centre, said supply of home-grown vegetables had dwindled right from the winter. The shortfall is met with imports, mainly from India.As soon as the monsoon started, flooding and landslides affected the supply system, sending prices high, he added.And there are no signs of the prices falling. “Naturally, vegetable prices rise during the monsoon as rainfall impacts output and supply.”Shrestha said the Kalimati fruits and vegetable market is receiving vegetables in smaller volumes these days. Before the monsoon the market received 700 tonnes of vegetables daily, but it has now dropped to 500 tonnes.The monsoon season in Nepal generally begins on June 13 and ends on October 2. This year, the phenomenon entered Nepal from the southwest on June 10, three days ahead of the usual onset date.The comparative supply figure shows that the daily vegetable arrival in the Kalimati fruits and vegetable market declined 7 percent within a month.Tomato, potato, and onion prices have seen a significant fluctuation.The average wholesale price of tomato big (Nepali) has increased by 36.36 percent to Rs75 per kg within a month. However, the price of small tomatoes produced in plastic tunnels has declined by 42.17 percent to Rs22.67.Shrestha said tomato prices in the summer fall due to increased production as tunnel farming is not affected by rains, and new farming systems have flourished.On June 18 last year, farmers threw around 90 tonnes of tomatoes on the road outside the Kalimati fruits and vegetable market to vent their anger at the low prices they were getting. The price of tomato big (Nepali) had plummeted to Rs35 per kg.Shrestha expected that the tomato price would not dip any lower.The wholesale price of potato (Indian) increased by 9.94 percent to Rs51.67 per kg.The price of Mude potato, produced in summer in high-altitude places like Mude of Sindhupalchok, increased by 4.08 percent to Rs51 per kg. The average wholesale price of onion (dry) increased by 47.09 percent to Rs97.67 per kg within a month. Vegetable traders said that onion prices have increased due to the Indian export tax policy.In May, India lifted the ban on onion export after nearly five months but imposed a minimum export price of $550 per tonne.The price of cauliflower also increased by 72.73 percent to Rs95 per kg during the review period. The price of cowpea (short) increased by 23.91 percent to Rs95 per kg, and the price of French bean (local) increased by 25 percent to Rs65 per kg.Bitter gourd now costs Rs45 per kg, rising by 28.57 percent within a month.Smooth gourd price sharply increased by 57.14 percent to Rs55 per kg.The price of squash round jumped 40 percent to Rs35 per kg within a month, while the price of okara shot up by 154.63 percent to Rs55 per kg.The price of mustard greens rose 106.22 percent to Rs55 per kg, and mustard leaf rose by 55.56 percent to Rs35 per kg.Button mushroom prices increased by 5.56 percent to Rs316.67 per kg.Even in its season, cucumber price has increased significantly. The price of cucumber (local) increased by 58.33 percent to Rs95 per kg while that of hybrid cucumber rose by 80 percent to Rs45 per kg.The price of capsicum increased by 2.27 percent to Rs45 per kg, while the cost of green chilli increased by 25 percent to Rs95 per kg. \nOn May 28, presenting the financial plan for the upcoming fiscal year, Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun said all the 77 districts of the country are now connected by the national road network.But the ground reality is different.Without a bridge over the Karnali river at Chuwa Khola of Kharpunath rural municipality, Simkot, the district headquarters of Humla, remains to be connected to the national road network. Villagers in the northwestern corner of Nepal bordering Tibet in China where the Humla Karnali crosses face hardships in the absence of one bridge.Though the track was opened to Simkot in mid-April, the construction of the bridge has yet to be completed. As a result, a 12 km section still needs to be completed to connect the district headquarters.Now, vehicles carrying goods along the Karnali Corridor can only reach Kharpu. From there, the goods have to be transported by helicopters and carried over the river using cables, resulting in additional costs. This method, however, is possible only when the water level is low. Due to the lack of a bridge, around ten vehicles bought for government offices and passenger service via Surkhet were taken across the river using ropes and a bulldozer. The cars are now operating on the Simkot side.In 2007-08, the government announced in the annual budget that it would connect Simkot to the national road network. However, even after a decade and a half, Simkot is not connected to the national road network.In September 2021, the joint venture of Swachchhanda, Mount, and Pumori was awarded the Rs110 million contract for the bridge. The construction companies were issued Rs11 million in advance, and the project completion deadline was fixed in March this year.However, the company did not start the construction work for a long time, and around a year ago, it was necessary to change the design.“The joint venture company was responsible for constructing a 55-metre-long motorable truss bridge. But when the contractor started to dig the foundation, a hot water spring was found,” said Bel Bahadur Nepali, chief of the Simikot-Hilsa Road Construction Project. “The assessment showed that the bridge will not be durable if it is constructed on the existing design. So, we made the new design, which got approved two weeks ago. We will start the bridge construction work in July.”Nepali said that with the change in design, the contractor has been given a new deadline to complete the project: August 2025.Binod Kumar Pokharel, chief district officer, said the locals have demanded a Bailey or portable bridge as it may take time to complete the project. “Due to the lack of a bridge, the travellers are facing hassles. The passenger and goods transport charges too are high.”Pokharel said the river's flow is high throughout the year, so vehicles must be towed across the river with the help of an earthmover to Simkot. “To solve the problem, the locals have demanded a Bailey bridge. We are assessing the need.”Until last year, vehicles were operated from Khulalu of Kalikot towards Mugu-Bajura-Sillisalla of Humla. Nepali said that the 39 km road track was opened this year. This year, a 39-kilometre stretch was added. The project opened 8 km of the total track, and the Nepal Army did the work on the remaining 9 km section. The road from Khulalu of Kalikot to the Chinese border is 268 km long. Of this, 95 km south of Simkot is served by transportation. However, as the vehicle flow is breached by the lack of a bridge, passengers from Simkot to Khapunath rural municipality must change the vehicle by crossing suspension bridges on foot.Dan Bahadur Shahi, a senior citizen, said since there is no bridge, vehicles are charging higher fares. Jeeps run on the 12km Simkot-Kharpu stretch. The vehicle operators charge Rs700 to Rs1,000 per person as fare for a special arrangement called “reserve”. In similar fashion, the jeep operated from Kharpu via Sillisalli to Surkhet charges Rs7,000 per person, he said.“We are compelled to change the vehicle as there is no bridge. While crossing the river using the suspension bridge, we need to pay wages to a porter,” Shahi said. “If there were a bridge, we would be able to reach Surkhet by a single vehicle, and the fare would be less.”The price of daily consumable goods in Simkot is sky high, too. “No goods-carriers operate here; small jeeps are permitted to carry passengers only. This means we have to transport goods using porters so the prices refuse to come down,” said Bhim Bahadur Rokaya, a trader at Simkot.“There is no chance of prices falling unless a bridge is constructed across the Kharpu river, allowing for goods to be ferried by trucks,” Rokaya said.Pokharel said that because route permits are issued only from Khulalu of Kalikot to Sillisalli, fares are not fixed. “We have directed the Transport Management Office, Jumla, to manage the route permit and fare. The decision will be taken soon by a meeting of the transportation management committee.” \nThe Epidemiology and Disease Control Division says it has been closely monitoring the outbreak of the Zika virus in India, as the spread of the deadly disease is a matter of serious concern in neighbouring Nepal due to multiple risk factors.Currently, Nepal is tackling a dengue outbreak, and the same vectors—Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus—that spread the dengue virus also spread the Zika virus.“Unrestricted cross-border movements of people from the two countries and the proximity and presence of virus-spreading vectors are the main risk factors,” said Dr Gokarna Dahal, chief of the Vector Control section at the Division. “Some hospitals and laboratories carry out other tests when they get negative reports of patients having dengue-like symptoms.”Zika causes microcephaly, a condition in which babies are born with underdeveloped head and brain damage. It is also linked to Guillain-Barre syndrome, a condition in which the immune system attacks the nerves causing muscle weakness and sometimes paralysis.Last week, India reported three cases of zike infection in Maharashtra state. Since 2016, India has witnessed Zika outbreaks every year except in 2019 and 2020.A risk assessment survey carried out in 2018 with the technical and financial support of the World Health Organisation showed that Nepal was a high-risk country for dengue and Zika outbreaks.Dengue-spreading mosquitoes—Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus—also transmit Zika and Chikungunya viruses, which means the vectors are present throughout the country.Doctors say all that is needed for an outbreak is a Zika-infected person, which could be anyone. Outbreaks of the disease in India every year and global movement of the people have increased the risk of an outbreak in our country too, according to them.The Ministry of Health and Population had carried out Zika surveillance in the past and tested samples of people having dengue-like symptoms, but the results came back negative, according to Dahal. The World Health Organisation Nepal had provided financial as well as technical support to acquire the technology to carry out the testing of the viruses, officials said.Doctors say Zika virus symptoms match those of the dengue virus—mild fever, rashes, muscle pain, headache, red eyes and a general feeling of discomfort in up to 80 percent of cases.Studies show that pregnant women and their foetuses are at high risk of Zika infection, as the virus causes microcephaly in the foetus.Zika virus was first identified in Uganda in 1947 in monkeys, according to the UN health agency. It was later detected in humans. Brazil saw the worst outbreak of the virus in 2015 and it has since then spread to 24 other countries. The WHO had declared Zika outbreak an international health emergency in 2016.Meanwhile, Nepal has recorded at least 1,268 dengue cases since January this year. Of the 72 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases: 141.Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. \nIn June last year, a measles outbreak was reported in Kathmandu’s Gokarneshwar Municipality. Along with Kathmandu of Bagmati Province, the outbreak of the deadly disease was reported in several districts of Lumbini, Karnali, Sudurpaschim, Koshi, and Madhesh provinces.And in less than a year of that outbreak, health authorities concerned have been gearing up to declare the entire Madhesh Province fully immunised.“We are all prepared to declare the Madhesh Province fully immunised,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “All the districts of Madhesh Province have been already declared fully covered, and we have decided to declare the province fully immunised.”To declare an area as fully immunised, all children under 15 months old residing there must be administered all vaccines of the routine immunisation programme.Child health experts doubt the claim that all eligible children of the Madhesh Province have been administered the routine vaccines. They say the decision to declare a fully immunised province could raise a sense of complacency in the public, which will ultimately backfire.“Most of the districts across the country have already been declared fully immunised, and the fact is outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases, including measles, keep getting reported,” said Dr Shyam Raj Upreti, former director general at the Department of Health Services. “Declaration of a fully immunised province could create a sense of complacency in the public. We also declared the entire country open-defecation-free years ago, but outbreaks of waterborne diseases, including diarrhoea and cholera, have not stopped.”Experts say many districts across the country have already been declared fully literate but it’s hard to believe that all the districts are indeed fully literate.“For the last four months, we have been launching extensive vaccination programmes to achieve the target of a fully immunised province,” said Dr Rajiv Jha, chief of the Provincial Health Directorate of Madhesh Province. “We have also carried out the survey and found 100 percent of children between 15 to 23 months are immunised.”Experts, however, say it is impossible to achieve fully immunised status, as babies are born every hour and every day. Coverage of most health programmes is low in Madhesh Province compared to districts of other provinces. People of certain communities go to maternal homes for child delivery and return months after, and the risk of missing the routine vaccination is high there, according to them.Vaccine coverage is low among people living along the Nepal-India border who keep travelling to India frequently. Most of them opt out of vaccine programmes run by both Nepal and India. Health experts say low vaccination coverage, internal migration, a lack of awareness of importance of vaccines, and government apathy are among the reasons for regular outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases.“Due to cross border movements, the trend to go to maternal homes for child delivery, lack of awareness about the importance of vaccination and hygiene and sanitation conditions, risk of children missing routine vaccines is high in Madhesh Province,” said Upreti. “More than the declaration of full immunisation, sustaining that status is very crucial. Childhood vaccination is a continuous process, which never ends, meaning that the target is never achieved.”The Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022, carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population, showed that at least four percent of children aged 12 to 23 months have received no vaccination.The number of children missing basic antigens in the routine immunisation programme in Madhesh Province was also staggering. According to the report, the immunisation coverage rate in Madhesh Province is only 68 percent, which means 32 percent of children in the province didn’t take all the vaccines. It is the lowest of all the seven provinces.The government provides 13 types of vaccines through the national immunisation programme. Gandaki Province has a 93 percent vaccine coverage rate, the highest in the country. The vaccine coverage in Sudurpaschim Province, which is considered less developed and less educated, is 89 percent.The vaccination coverage rate is 81 percent in Koshi, 83 percent in Bagmati, 85 percent in Lumbini, and 84 percent in Karnali Province.Immunisation is considered the most cost-effective and efficient way to control and eliminate vaccine-preventable diseases that contribute to childhood illnesses and deaths. \nAt least 1,072 people from across the country have been infected with A(H1N1), also known as the swine flu virus, since January, this year.Data provided by the National Public Health Laboratory shows that 373 others were infected with the influenza B virus, 75 with the A (H3) virus, also known as Hong Kong Flu, 13 with co-infection of swine flu and coronavirus, and two with co-infection of influenza B and coronavirus. What concerns public virologists and infectious disease experts in Nepal is that less than one-fifth of cases of influenza-like illnesses are diagnosed, and neither the doctors attending patients nor the authorities concerned bother to know the real cause of ailments. They say that of the swab samples of 8,739 people with an influenza-like illness, only 1,743 tested positive for various kinds of influenza. “The cause of ailments of the rest of people are not known, which should be a cause of serious concern to the researchers as well as policymakers,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “The criteria for collecting the swab samples for influenza test is that patients should have an influenza-like illness, but only less than one-fifth of samples are testing positive for influenza.”The laboratory only maintains a record of the positive cases but does not tell anything about fatalities due to infections. Experts say the number of people infected with influenza could be several times higher than the data provided by the laboratory, as many people suffering from influenza-like illness do not seek treatment. Even for those who do seek treatment, in most cases, the underlying cause of their ailments often remains undiagnosed. “The next pandemic could also be a pandemic of respiratory viruses,” said Pun. “We will not be able to lessen the risk of outbreaks in future if we continue ignoring the risks. Authorities must step up surveillance and investigate the underlying causes of these ailments.”A recent report by the Nepal Statistics Office also shows that cold and fever remain a significant concern, with an increase from 43.7 percent in 1995/96 to 51. 5 percent in 2022/23.Doctors say more people get infected with viruses during the seasonal changes, as most viruses—adenovirus, rhinovirus, influenza virus, and even coronavirus—become active during these times and winter.But this does not mean respiratory viruses do not spread at other times. “People are getting continuously infected with respiratory viruses in other seasons as well. Those with weak immunity could become more severely affected by the infection,” said Dr Raju Pangeni, a pulmonologist. “Besides urging people to take precautions against these risks, authorities must step up surveillance measures to know the real causes of influenza-like illnesses.”As very few people in Nepal receive flu shots. Experts say unvaccinated elderly people and those with compromised immunity are at risk of severe respiratory virus infections.Doctors say the influenza virus causes respiratory complications, which affect the lungs. It quickly spreads in communities. The diseases can cause fever, cough, body aches, occasional vomiting, diarrhoea and pneumonia.They say that early diagnosis is crucial for preventing infection. Patients recover quickly if treated on time. Both the severity of the disease and the number of deaths increase if seasonal influenza cases are not diagnosed on time, according to experts. \nNineteen-year-old Ekta suffers from excruciating pain during her periods. It is far beyond the usual pain and cannot be managed with medication–she’s tried that multiple times. Taking one dose of Meftal (a period pain medication) is never enough. The pain is debilitating most of the time.Despite several visits to gynaecologists, her complaints have been brushed aside as normal period pains. She strongly feels that her pain is abnormal, but feels powerless to address her issues.“The pain is so bad, but I cannot do anything about it,” she says. “I can’t count the number of times that I’ve been told that my debilitating pain is normal,” bemoans Ekta, whose name has been changed to protect her privacy.The normalisation of period pains means serious reproductive conditions like endometriosis often go untreated. People with endometriosis experience severe pelvic pain because tissues like that found outside the uterus grow inside it. Other symptoms of the condition include heavy bleeding during and between periods and fatigue. There is no known cure for this condition, and symptoms can start from the first period onwards.A major challenge experienced by women with endometriosis is the disregard of their symptoms by the public and medical professionals alike. Due to lack of awareness about the debilitating pain typical to endometriosis, both the person suffering from the condition, and their doctors often underestimate their severity.Severe pelvic pain is a key indicator for diagnosing endometriosis, says Dr Reena Shrestha, a gynaecologist at Madhyapur Hospital. When patients seek consultation regarding the kind of severe pain that significantly disrupts their lives, they may undergo two types of tests: transvaginal ultrasound and diagnostic laparoscopy. These procedures are used to determine the presence of endometriosis. Endometriosis is a complex condition, says Dr Hema Pradhan, a consultant gynaecologist at Everest Hospital. Amongst all the patients she meets at her consultations, many frequently turn out to have endometriosis. But, she’s noticed that often patients often delay seeking treatment because period pains are often normalised.“Women who come to me with their symptoms often delay seeking treatment, because, regardless of the severity of their pain, they believe all period pains to be normal,” says Pradhan.Eighteen-year-old Rima (name change) has been struggling with excessive pain before and during periods for years. She also experiences pain while urinating during her periods. Rima has also been diagnosed with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS). The co-occurence of PCOS and endometriosis is not unheard of, although research on them has been minimal.“I can barely walk when I’m on my periods, but I’ve always been told that I should just learn to live with it,” she says.Despite knowing about PCOS, she discovered the possibility of having endometriosis quite later in life. She shares this because period pain, even excessive ones, have been normalised for far too long.The general lack of awareness of endometriosis, and widespread normalisation of period pains, often results in late diagnosis and treatment of the condition.Although there may be no cure to the condition, there are ways to manage its most severe symptoms. Furthermore, receiving a diagnosis can greatly help patients to understand the severity of their condition, according to doctors. “I’m incapable of doing anything during my periods. One time I had to leave the examination in the middle of my exams because of the pain,” says Ekta. “I can’t study, can’t work, all I can do is stay in bed and cry,” she adds.Dr Pradhan reveals another challenging aspect of diagnosing endometriosis. Sometimes the condition may not appear on ultrasound scans initially. Endometrial deposits may appear differently in women due to hormonal changes. Furthermore, symptoms may vary, with some being asymptomatic altogether. According to Dr Shrestha, once a gynaecologist confirms that the patient has endometriosis, they will certainly recommend methods to manage the pain. These include analgesics for pain relief, and home remedies like hot water bag massage.However, the main problem remains. Due to lack of awareness, most patients may only find out about their condition later in life.In some cases women only discover they have endometriosis when they face infertility. Endometriosis is associated with infertility, and 30-50% of people with endometriosis may experience infertility. This also exposes another troubling aspect associated with endometriosis. Ekta shares that her relatives often express concerns about her potential infertility.“They just make me feel bad that I might never get pregnant. And it makes me feel worse,” Ekta adds.Worldwide, endometriosis has been known as a scientifically under-researched condition. It has even been called the ‘missed disease’ because of inconsistencies in its diagnosis and treatment. Endometriosis has also been widely ignored by policy makers.Treatment for endometriosis depends on the individual, says Dr Pradhan. Some are treated with hormonal medication, and others require surgical procedures. The main way to combat endometriosis is timely diagnosis, and timely treatment, she adds.“Raising awareness, timely diagnosis, and treatment are very important,” Dr Pradhan says. \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra, a Nepali chef in New York, established \"The Sewing Tin\" to promote Nepali cuisine, blending traditional flavors with modern techniques and addressing challenges faced by outsiders while highlighting the importance of culinary passion and storytelling.\nCeleus Baral, an environmental science student and baker, runs an online baking shop (Bakeleus) while promoting sustainability and sharing baking expertise through recipes and her zero-waste policy.\nPotatoes, a widely consumed staple in Nepal, provide numerous nutrients, and are cultivated in diverse climates and imported for various products, including popular snacks like chips and fries, offering health benefits but requiring moderation for those with diabetes.\nIn a challenging and transformational journey from film production to an Everest trek, the author grapples with life's uncertainties, embraces nature's lessons, and discovers resilience and meaning while striving for a summit.\nA group of journalists experienced Sri Lanka's natural beauty, heritage sites, and economic recovery (including its tourism sector) during a six-day tour covering 1,000 kilometers.\nNepal offers diverse destinations for exploration, including new cultural treks like Mundhum and the ancient Janaki Mandir, along with picturesque trekking in Kuri Village, Annapurna Base Camp, and wildlife experiences in Bardiya and Khaptad National Parks.\nThe author reminisces about his homecoming to Phidim, a transformed town that faces a worrying trend of outmigration due to a lack of prospects.\nBara Imambara, a historical monument in Lucknow (the \"City of Nawabs\") built in 1784, features the magnificent Asafi Mosque, the vast pillarless Asafi Hall with the tomb of Asaf-ud-Daula, the labyrinthine Bhool Bhulaiyaa, and the underground Shahi Baoli with a unique CCTV-like design.\nUruguay emerged as Group C winners at Copa America, eliminating host nation the United States despite a heated matchup marked by physical altercations, injuries, and questionable refereeing.\nPanama beat Bolivia 3-1 to qualify for the Copa America quarter-finals, eliminating hosts USA, while Uruguay won the group with nine points.\n“Time beat him. Time takes everybody out. It’s undefeated,” said Rocky Balboa in the film “Creed” and those words could easily be applied to Portugal’s Cristiano Ronaldo who struggled to impose himself on their Euro 2024 last-16 game with Slovenia on Monday.A tearful Ronaldo being embraced and comforted by team mates after missing a penalty in extra time that could have helped Portugal secure a spot in the quarter-finals before a shootout win is a cathartic image that stunned fans around the world.Portugal won 3-0 on penalties minutes later, with Ronaldo converting the first spot kick and apologising to fans in the stands immediately after scoring before breaking down in tears following the game and being unable to finish an interview.His tears showed more than just the sorrow or guilt of a player feeling the weight of responsibility from almost letting his country down. They were the tears of a frustrated player who expects greatness but was not the difference-maker he once was.During the 2022 World Cup Ronaldo said: “The best timing is my timing” as he arrived in Qatar with his career in turmoil, about to leave Manchester United to play in Saudi Arabia.Ronaldo, a five-times Ballon D’Or winner, had arrived with a mission to prove he could still make a difference on the world stage. But he ended the tournament on the bench and had no impact as a substitute in the 1-0 quarter-final loss to Morocco.After that defeat, the shocking image of Ronaldo running to the tunnel in tears as desolate as the football world had ever seen him was something Portugal fans were not used to.But with long-time Portugal manager Fernando Santos gone and newcomer Roberto Martinez trusting him with the captaincy and a leadership role in a young and talented squad, Ronaldo was given another shot at glory in Euro 2024.Despite being a model of longevity for more than two decades in an outstanding career, breaking numerous records and playing for some of the biggest clubs in the world, Ronaldo has been a shadow of his old self over the last two weeks in Germany.Lacking the speed, explosion and agility that were his trademarks while pouncing on balls like a tiger to plunder goals in various ways that only he was able to, the 2024 version of Ronaldo has yet to score at this Euros after four games.Against Slovenia, just as in the previous three games, his shooting was off-kilter and his headers failed to trouble keeper Jan Oblak while his team mates seemed to be forcing the ball to him, disrupting Portugal’s tempo and slowing them down.At 39, Ronaldo would have become the oldest player to score in a European Championship if he had netted his extra-time penalty but he failed to beat the excellent Oblak and instead of relief came desperation.Martinez still trusted him to take the first penalty in the shootout and Ronaldo duly delivered to help Portugal stay alive at the Euros, with several records that he is still seeking.They will face France in the quarter-finals with the world questioning whether Ronaldo’s brilliant international career is nearing an end. There could still be a happy ending for one of the world’s greatest ever players - only time will tell. \nGoalkeeper Diogo Costa saved all three penalties as Portugal won 3-0 in a shootout against a brave Slovenia side who had held them to a 0-0 draw after Cristiano Ronaldo’s extra-time miss from the spot in a dramatic Euro 2024 last-16 clash on Monday.Portugal had the lion’s share of the chances but also their brilliant goalkeeper to thank for a one-on-one save from Slovenia striker Benjamin Sesko as they stumbled into a quarter-final meeting with France in Hamburg on Friday.Costa also saved from Josip Ilicic, Jure Balkovec and Benjamin Verbic in the shootout - the first keeper to save three penalties in a Euros shootout - to send his side through despite a team performance that lacked spark for the most part.“This is probably the best game of my life,” Costa said. “I focused on doing what I had to do. I went with my gut feeling. Of course we had analysed the penalty takers, but players change how they shoot. I'm very happy and very excited to have helped the team.”Ronaldo in particular will come under the spotlight as he wasted several opportunities to go with a penalty miss in extra-time that left him in a flood of tears and needing to be consoled by team mates.Portugal were awarded the penalty late in the first half of extra time when Diogo Jota’s storming run into the box was illegally stopped by defender Vanja Drkusic, who had already been booked and was lucky not to receive a second yellow card.They have a reliable penalty taker in their team in Bruno Fernandes but captain Ronaldo elected to take it and his effort was superbly saved to his left by Slovenia’s Jan Oblak, who pushed the ball onto the post.“Even the strongest people have their (bad) days. I was at rock bottom ... when the team needed me the most,” Ronaldo said in a post-match interview before bursting into tears again.“Sadness at the start is joy at the end. That’s what football is. Moments, inexplicable moments,” he said. \nAn 85th-minute deflected shot by Randal Kolo Muani, listed as a Jan Vertonghen own goal, gave France a nervy 1-0 win over a disappointing Belgium on Monday and sent them into the quarter-finals despite another poor show by their misfiring forwards.France made most of the running in a cagey game but were reckless with their finishing, until a nice combination of passes, finished off by N’Golo Kante, finally created space for substitute Kolo Muani to turn and bundle a mishit shot in off the leg of Vertonghen and leave goalkeeper Koen Casteels wrong-footed.France will now meet the winner of Monday’s match Portugal in the quarter-finals in Hamburg on Friday.It was a fittingly scruffy decider for an underwhelming game and means that France still have yet to score in open play at the tournament, recording two own goals and a Kylian Mbappe penalty across their four games.Various combinations have been tried up front, while midfielders and defenders also caught the bug on Monday with some wild attempts, but coach Didier Deschamps, unsurprisingly, preferred to focus on the positives.Belgium clearly had a plan to take any speed out of the game, playing at less than walking pace at times, with Kevin de Bruyne often operating just in front of his back four.The only decent chance of the first half came for France after 34 minutes when Jules Kounde whipped in a curling cross that recalled striker Marcus Thuram headed wide.Aurelien Tchouameni forced Koen Casteels into his first save of the day soon after the break, while ever-lively Mbappe miskicked a decent chance as France began to put some passes together.A rare Belgian thrust was cut short by a brilliant Theo Hernandez tackle just as Yannick Carrasco was about to pull the trigger and Romelu Lukaku and De Bruyne then brought good saves from Mike Maignan.France were in the ascendancy but the poor finishing that has dogged their campaign continued with William Saliba and Mbappe both blazing wildly over before Kolo Muani's decisive intervention.It was a meeting between officially the second (France) and third (Belgium) best teams in the world, but after both edged into the knockout stage managing only two goals apiece from their three games, both looked extremely cautious in attack for most of it.For Belgium, another dispiritingly tame exit adds to their appalling record in the European championship since losing in the final in \nHeavy rain continued to trigger flood and landslides in India’s north and north-east, killing at least 11 people and affecting hundreds of thousands, officials from two affected states said on Tuesday.In India’s most populous state of Uttar Pradesh, which has been hit by torrential rain, nine people died in rain-related incidents in the last 24 hours, an official bulletin said.Two people died on Monday in the north-eastern state of Assam, which has been hit by a second wave of flooding since June 16, affecting more than 600,000 people in 19 districts, and displacing more than 8,000, a state disaster management statement said.Kaziranga National Park in Assam - home to nearly 2,200 one-horned rhinos, or two-thirds of their world population - is also under water, with more than half of its 233 camps flooded, drowning four hog deer, officials said.“The flood water has now entered my house. The water has damaged my paddy and crops. I have a family of five and I have to take shelter here. If the situation worsens, I will lose my house,” Faizul Islam, a local resident told news agency ANI, in which Reuters has a minority stake.Visuals from ANI showed inundated fields and roads across Assam, as people moved precious belongings and furniture from their water-filled homes.In the northeastern region of neighbouring Bangladesh, the flood situation was worsening rapidly due to continuous rain and upstream water flow from India, leaving tens of thousands of people marooned, officials said on Tuesday.Authorities used loudspeakers in the south-eastern region of Chittagong to alert residents about the high risk of landslides, triggered by heavy rains, and offer help in evacuations, government official Abul Bashar Mohammed Fakruzzaman said.India’s north-east and Bangladesh have been ravaged by floods in the last two months, leaving millions stranded, with weather authorities predicting that the situation could worsen.In Assam’s neighbouring state of Arunachal Pradesh, which also borders China, incessant rains have forced the closure of schools in its capital Itanagar, till the end of this week, local officials said.More rain is predicted for the region over the next three days, according to the country’s weather office.India’s weather department issued warnings on Tuesday for heavy to extremely heavy rainfall across western, northern and north-eastern states for the rest of this week. \nRussian missiles struck Starokostiantyniv Air Base as Ukraine prepares to receive US F-16 fighter jets, potentially disrupting Russia's efforts to ground them.\nIndia replaces colonial-era criminal laws with new legislation aimed at enhancing justice but facing criticism from the opposition for potential disruption to the criminal justice system.\nUnauthorised translations of popular books have flooded the Nepali market, disregarding copyright laws and damaging the industry, despite the presence of the Copyright Act.\nIn villages formerly Maoist strongholds, youth fleeing poverty have lost millions via \"tallo bato\" (backdoor route) to America, with eight deported and losing an average of Rs6 million each.\nPrivate hospitals in Pokhara, Chitwan, Biratnagar, and Butwal are ignoring a government mandate to provide free treatment to the poor, despite regulations requiring them to set aside 10% of their beds for the underprivileged.\nIt has been 20 years since the 2005 Hong Kong Ministerial Meeting recognised that developing and, mainly, least developed countries (LDCs) cannot meaningfully participate in the global trading system as envisaged while establishing the World Trade Organization (WTO) without “some kind of support” to enhance their trade capacity. This gave birth to the idea of Aid for Trade (AfT). The WTO claims that AfT is particularly helpful to the LDCs, which “face a range of supply-side and trade-related infrastructure obstacles which constrain their ability to engage in international trade.” In theory, it mobilises resources to address the trade-related constraints identified by these countries.According to WTO data, $556 billion in AfT was disbursed between 2006 and 2020. AfP’s priority and focus naturally shift with the tide of time. Initially, it focused more on improving trade logistics and enabling small businesses to trade their generally uncompetitive products, wishfully, in developed countries. Now, the weight of the discourse seems to be inclined to climate change issues arising in every knot of the supply chain, the scope of gender equity in sharing trade benefits, and the digital divide as an additional constraint to LDCs when the global trade in both goods and services is being rapidly digitised.Key questionsHas the AfT really helped developing and least-developed countries build their trade capacities and provided the much-needed market share for their goods (and services) in developed countries? The WTO leadership claims that trade (solely?) lifted 1.5 billion people out of abject poverty. It appears as if the global population’s poverty reduction is only because of increased cross-border trade and all the official development assistance received by any poverty-stricken country meant only for trade. Nevertheless, the amount in aggregate disbursement under AfT looks impressive. When it comes to the annual average, it is less than $40 billion a year; when divided among the 137 developing out of 217 economies, the dole out is mere symbolism and not enough to undertake even a single medium-sized project. Forty-five countries are still categorised as LDCs, and 32 are small, landlocked economies like Nepal. When viewed through the challenges faced in accessing trade passage through another sovereign territory, the correlation between their LDC status and landlockedness can’t just be coincidental.For instance, according to the Creditor Reporting System of OECD, Nepal received over $300 million as AfT until 2019. The Enhanced Integrated Framework under the WTO supported the development of the Nepal Trade Integration Strategy (NTIS) to identify the goods with import potential and to conduct several studies like the e-readiness of the businesses. Nepal has developed three versions of the NTIS in the last 15 years—in 2010, 2016 and 2023. The country has increased the list of products and services from 19 to thirty-six. But export trade has only nose-dived over this period, not only in terms of export-import ratio but also in nominal value.Why have we failed in our trade capacity building so badly, and why couldn't all the financial aid flow in support to this end? More importantly, have these international frameworks and support helped developing and least-developed countries excel in balancing their trade in their favour? More often than not, the answer, sadly, is in the negative. Why are LDCs left behind?The 9th Aid for Trade review took place at the WTO headquarters in Geneva in the last week of June. Sessions like “Trade for All” and “Realizing LDCs’ Trade Potential” were also part of the rituals. The reasons for LDCs’ failures may be aplenty, including their inability to set production and trade priorities, bad governance and political instability. However, in the true sense, they are not supported throughout this process. Instead, these voiceless countries are incessantly derided for not doing enough, being reactive, making negativity a survival tactic, and being angry and critical of the Western developed countries for no reason. The reality is different. These essentially neo-colonial narratives are created to cover up the developed countries’ intentions to extend their trade protectionism. They lecture on the developing and poor countries on the perils of climate change while failing to change their own lifestyle and renunciating their luxuries, even partially. Such annual rituals, even publications, highlight achievements that hardly reflect ground reality in the countries concerned; instead, feigned diplomatic niceties rule the roost.Contentious issues like the possibility of the supply chain being destroyed by the Russia-Ukraine war, the trade wars between the major trade partners in the world, like the US and China and India and China, and their gross violations of global trade rules, are hardly discussed in detail. The discussion on peripheral issues chosen by “experienced” consultants makes it easy to evade truly excruciating issues. Underdeveloped and developing countries are instructed to transform into a green economy. But the governments and citizens of developed countries who are using air conditioners, refrigerators and fossil fuel vehicles on a mammoth scale are not ready to give up their lifestyles. The underdeveloped world, which consumes only a very small part of it, is held guilty. The developed countries have no intention of reducing major carbon emissions, and it looks impossible given their consumption patterns. Seventy percent of the electricity consumed by developed countries comes from coal, diesel and petrol plants. Air travel and cargo shipment are unlikely to be replaced by green energy for the next several decades.There is nothing for least-developed countries to sell in the competitive global trade. They cannot be expected to produce and sell high-quality, refined and high-value-low volume goods. They can sell either agricultural products or primary or secondary raw materials. It can never be a profitable and sustainable trade. Lately, organic products have suddenly become the import priority of developed countries. But have chemical fertilisers and pesticides been explored and diffused by developing countries? The production system of the developing world became dependent on harmful fertilisers and pesticides produced and aggressively traded by the developed countries. How, then, will these agriculture-based economies trade with new phyto-sanitation and other rules?Worst of all, the West has monopolised the knowledge products, knowledge systems and discourses related to the trade vulnerability of the LDCs. This has created a significant barrier even for a dispassionate debate on it. The LDCs are once again at the receiving end of the so-called global system—trade. \nSummer has had its time, and monsoon mayhem will make headlines for the next few months. This has continued for ages, and with a changing climate, it is likely to increase. We can’t stop monsoons from entering our territory, nor do we want to; they are the lifeline of Nepal’s agriculture, food security, biodiversity, water recharge and many more. We can’t modify its onset, spread and intensity. However, we would be keenly interested in knowing about its arrival, its impacts, its impact area, and its victims. The progress in hydromet science allows us to forecast rainy days, hot days, cold days and many other hydromet phenomena with reasonable spatial and temporal accuracy. When combined or overlaid with exposure and vulnerabilities (poverty, house structures, settlement locations, etc.), forecasts can tell us who will be affected the most, where and when. This is possible through “impact-based forecast” (IBF). So, why not use this knowledge and gear ourselves up to act whenever we have such information? Well, things have already begun, and it’s time to mainstream this approach to managing disaster risks. The “anticipation or anticipatory action” approach entails acting ahead of predicted hazards to prevent or reduce acute humanitarian impacts before they fully unfold. Anticipatory action, as such, is an integral part of disaster risk management, and it systematically links forecast information to actions that can help reduce disaster impacts and protect lives and livelihoods. When you have credible information about a hazard with its occurrence (time and location) reasonably known, there cannot be any excuse for inaction. Since there are now reasonably accurate forecasts of many natural hazards, it is a matter of using forecast science and information in decision-making. Anticipatory action (AA) is yet to be fully integrated into risk management policies and practices in many countries. However, the intention is to make it an integral part of Disaster Risk Management (DRM) thinking and practice. Some operational challenges and “perceived” difficulties are associated with its integration. Here, I discuss some of those challenges in Nepal’s context. First and foremost is the complexity of the narrative itself. Therefore, the first step is to simply demystify the narrative of anticipation—what it means and doesn’t. In Nepal, anticipatory action was first introduced as “forecast-based financing” (in 2015-16), where rainfall forecasts from the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology were used to inform and prepare organisations to respond better and quicker to looming floods. Somewhere during 2016-17, some of the Disaster Preparedness and Response Plans (DPRPs) and the national DRR Strategic Plan of Action also tried to incorporate anticipation. Nevertheless, those initiatives remained ephemeral as they were marred with classical problems of being supply-driven and top-down and needing more compelling evidence. Furthermore, there was little investment in clarifying the approach, follow-up and communication, as well as strengthening capacities and building systems. Second, to a larger extent, AA has been siloed within non-state actors (mainly with the I/NGOs, UN and donors) and has been limited to small-scale “pilots”. Though the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority (NDRRMA) is now taking it up, it has not yet been systematically integrated into the government's disaster risk management thinking and practice. Nepal needs a government-led process that brings actors together to agree on an operational framework, harmonise the approach, charter a pathway and milestones, and reinforce mutual accountability. NDRRMA should encourage actors to get out of their “minuscule pilots” and facilitate bigger and scalable impacts. In the meantime, the actors/stakeholders should join hands to support the government in developing and implementing plans for anticipation at scale for different hazards. The obsession with quick wins and tangible results is another classical problem facing many donor-funded initiatives; AA is no exception. While such pursuits are soothing and pleasing, they do not always produce durable and sustainable solutions. Therefore, the donors must emphasise “building/strengthening systems” for anticipatory action through what they call the “build money”. The government needs to strengthen the systems, capacity and infrastructure for the governments to use weather forecasts as decision-support information. Meanwhile, the donor priority for anticipatory action mustn't crowd out funding for long-term preparedness, risk reduction and resilience building. Anticipatory action can be implemented at scale only through a robust disaster risk management system. Sustainable funding for implementing anticipatory action should ideally come from the local and provincial governments. While the federal government, donors and non-state actors can support strengthening systems and capacities, the “fuel money” should come from the local governments, allowing for the implementation of anticipatory actions for imminent threats. The policy and legislative interventions/reforms should empower governments to earmark a portion of their coffer to act ex-ante and release funds for anticipatory actions based on the imminent threat of a hazard. This is not technical and administrative but rather political; it requires bold decisions, innovation and accountability.  \nDuring my recent visit to Bajura District, I explored olive farming and witnessed its current state in the region. My interaction with Janesh Bhandari, a local civic campaigner, revealed the unfortunate stagnation of a once-promising project. Funded by the Italian government with approximately 1.4 million Euros allocated for Kathmandu, Dolpa and Bajura, this project saw half of the funds directed to Bajura alone. Preliminary research identified that out of 28 species planted, 24 bore fruit, and 10 were recommended for Nepal.Following the success of the pilot study, the Government of Nepal (GoN) has designated Bajura, encompassing the municipalities of Jagannath, Himali, Swamikartik and Budhinanda, as an olive zone. In 2016, an Olive Zone Implementation Unit was established under the Prime Minister Agriculture Modernisation (2015-25) Project. The main goal of this unit is to promote commercial olive farming and enhance the management and utilisation of natural olive forests to increase farmers’ incomes. Despite such significant investment in research, commercial olive farming remains unfruitful, owing to several challenges.ProspectsEmpirical evidence suggests that olive farming in Bajura could serve as a nature-based solution to diversify the local production system. Investing in both wild and domesticated olives could boost household incomes and generate employment in the region. Given the environmental, social and economic benefits, olive cultivation could enhance the resilience and well-being of smallholding farmers. Research also highlights olive as a crop with a high potential for income, employment opportunities and improvement in economic status.Olive oil is a common product in Nepal, but olive wood handicrafts are globally popular. Handicraft items from olive wood fetch high prices, including wooden bowls and plates, which sell at a range of $20-70. Olive oil is also used in producing soaps, scents, skincare and other cosmetics. Nepal imported olive products worth $616,217 in 2022, which shows a year-on-year value growth of 70.38 percent. With olive oil prices in the Nepali market ranging from Rs2,000 to 3,000 per litre, the market potential for olive oil and its diversified products is substantial, making systematic cultivation a promising avenue for import substitution. The Prime Minister's Agriculture Modernisation Project has initiated a programme to construct infrastructure for olive farming and provide relief of Rs427,000 for 2,386 farmers in Bajura.ChallengesDespite Bajura being designated as an olive production zone, several challenges hinder the commercial farming of olives. One major issue is the underutilisation of wild olives due to the lack of collection and processing centres. In addition to these, another challenge was the lack of a three-phase electricity line essential for the production centre's operation, rendering the plant dysfunctional at the moment.Additionally, there is a significant mindset barrier among farmers and local people. Olive trees take five years to bear fruit, and most farmers attracted to faster-yielding crops like apples are reluctant to invest in olive cultivation. The farmers’ economic status exacerbates this reluctance, as they cannot afford to wait for such a long harvest period.Another challenge is the lack of a technically skilled workforce. Some farmers have fallen short of the necessary knowledge about olive cultivation and its benefits, and others have shifted to high-value crops, abandoning traditional farming practices in the region. Educating them about the economic and health benefits of olive farming could prove beneficial. Policy measuresNepal can draw inspiration from Rajasthan, India, where the government actively promoted olive cultivation by introducing Israeli technology and operational models. The Government of India included olives under the national mission on oilseeds and oil palm. After eight years of nurturing olive saplings, this led to the successful launch of Rajasthan's first indigenous olive oil brand. Similarly, Pakistan has seen impressive success in olive farming. In 2022, the country exported virgin and extra virgin olive oil worth $1.9 million. This achievement was enabled by a project launched in 2012 by the Pakistani government, in cooperation with the Italian government, called \"Promotion of Olive Cultivation for Economic Development and Poverty Alleviation\". This project, run through the Pakistan Agriculture Research Council (PARC), has provided Pakistani farmers with training on pruning techniques and technological support. As a result, Italy and Pakistan now enjoy an annual trade relationship worth €2 billion.With the government initiating an olive zone, it is now crucial for local authorities to take ownership of the project and explore the commercial viability of olive oil extraction. Currently, only a few informed individuals at the policy level are aware of the prospects. Disseminating information to local farmers and communities is imperative, as olive is not a part of Nepal's traditional lifestyle and food habits. The government should implement policy measures such as incorporating olive farming into the curriculum of universities and schools. Agricultural universities should encourage students to intern in olive farming regions for practical experience.Once commercial farming is established, Nepal should register with the International Olive Council to gain wider recognition. Agricultural documents should highlight olives as prospective crops, and proper national records should be maintained on the status of wild and commercially farmed olives. Additionally, it is essential to have trained technicians and experts to oversee olive cultivation and farming. With coordinated action from the government, local officials, farmers and other key stakeholders, olive cultivation could become a lucrative endeavour in Nepal. This could help diversify the country's agriculture sector and foster economic development. \nNepal is nominally a federal country being ruled by political leaders and bureaucrats who are still wedded to their old unitary habits. The centre tightly controls and shapes the political structures of provinces. When there is a political ruction in Kathmandu, its tremors shake all seven provinces. This would not have been the case had the provinces been allowed to operate with a high level of autonomy as envisioned by the new constitution. Right now, the provinces cannot even undertake the basic duty of maintenance of law and order. Schedule 6 of the constitution outlines 21 exclusive authorities of the provincial governments, with maintenance of law and order being at the top of the list. Yet the provinces are yet to get their own police forces, which is in contravention of Article 268 (2) of the national charter. The legislation for the adjustment of the Nepal Police personnel was passed way back in 2019. But the actual process has never gotten underway. The reluctant federalists at the centre—including the top leaders of most political parties—are to be blamed for this. Yet they are not alone in being hesitant on the much-needed change. There is disquiet even among police personnel about the new legislation. The Police Personnel Adjustment Act, for instance, authorises the federal government to assign a deputy inspector general of Nepal Police to serve as province police chief. Such officers can be transferred to other provinces or departments of Nepal Police. But in the case of other lower-ranking officers deputed to the provinces, they can then be transferred only within the police units of the respective province. The police force—already rocked by a drastic decline in the interest of youngsters to fill its vacancies—worries that permanently posting certain officials to certain provinces will jeopardise their career prospects. As such, the interest in joining the force would further wane. The police headquarters has intimated to national leaders and lawmakers that there should be more incentives to lure capable personnel into provinces. If that is what it takes to meet one of the core objectives of the federal system, what is stopping the federal government and the national legislature, both of which are constitutionally bound to implement federalism, from pushing for such a change? The representatives of provincial governments are fed up with the lack of the centre’s interest and are again threatening to hit the streets. The internal affairs ministers of all seven provinces plan to meet Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal to build pressure. This protracted saga of police adjustment is just one reminder of how hard it is to implement federalism so long as the country’s political leadership remains reluctant to empower the provinces and local bodies. Had there been any willingness to do so, the nitty-gritty of the relevant legislation could have been worked out. Most police personnel are not refusing to be posted in provinces. They are only asking for the right incentives. In order to make the federal system work, ways must be found to bridge the troubling mismatch between the expectations of employees of vital institutions and the incentives on offer.  \nThe famed “iron gate” called the Secondary Education Examinations has closed for 242,313 students, as 52.14 percent of the examinees failed to secure any grades, being categorised as non-graded. The National Examinations Board on Thursday published the results of the SEE held from March 28 to April 9. Of the 464,785 students who took the 10th-grade final examination, 222,472 (47.86) percent have qualified for further studies. ­­­Those who have been non-graded for up to two subjects will get a chance to reappear for the exams a month later, and the percentage of students entering higher education is expected to go up.The dismal results have once again brought to light the fact that it is high time we changed the teaching-learning system in the country. This year, the students had written their exams on the new syllabus, but the results have not improved. In fact, the results are as bad as the days of the School Leaving Certificate (SLC), the original “iron gate” we had set out to change. Nepal introduced the grading system in 2016 with the hope of reforming the examination system and improving the student pass percentage. However, after eight years of experimenting with the grading system, it is clear that the changes were cosmetic. What we needed was a complete overhaul of the teaching-learning system. Hoping to see changes in the SEE results without changing the fundamentals was immature, as the results over the years have clearly shown.Even today, students in rural government schools, who make up the bulk of the student population, do not get their course books on time; there are no teachers in their schools; and they faced the brunt of the digital divide during the Covid-19 pandemic when urban schools transitioned to online education while their ill-equipped schools shut down completely. Having to take the same exams as the students from elite, urban schools that offer better labs, teachers and access to the English language, and the students from rural and public schools are systematically conditioned to mess up the exams. And in failing hundreds of thousands of students each year, the education system of the country too fails. We are already late in making school education a programme of learning and growth rather than competitive exams. The very idea of a national exam for a country with Nepal’s level of linguistic, ethnic, regional and economic diversities, among others, is flawed. Despite decades of professing affirmative action, we continue to force students to compete in subjects, say Nepali and English, in which they have advantage or disadvantage. Moreover, we are nearing a decade of implementing federalism, which mandates local levels to manage secondary-level education. A one-size-fits-all teaching and examination system does not meet the requirements of a well-rounded education anymore. Many of the students who face the humiliation of being “non-graded” today might excel in technical and vocational education. It is only by recognising and addressing these differences that we can change our school education system for the better. \nAfter a 14-year-long ordeal, involving a seven-year asylum in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and a five-year incarceration in the high-security Belmarsh Prison, Julian Assange, who earned global fame for releasing classified American documents, is finally a free man. Assange, now 51, stepped into freedom outside of an American court in the US Pacific island territory of Saipan on Wednesday after pleading guilty to a criminal count of conspiring to obtain and disclose classified defence documents. As he was sentenced to time he had already served in prison, he was allowed to head home to Australia.Assange’s freedom has come as a relief to his supporters across the globe, especially so for those who value the disclosures made by the company he founded, WikiLeaks. In November 2010, WikiLeaks had released over 250,000 US diplomatic cables with the help of Chelsea Manning, a former US army soldier who was convicted under the US Espionage Act and had her sentence commuted by President Barack Obama. The WikiLeaks exposed, among other things, the fact that the US forces in Baghdad had killed 11 people in a 2007 helicopter attack; criticism of the UK’s military operation in Afghanistan by US commanders and the Afghan president; and thousands of US diplomatic cables that revealed how the US used its embassies for espionage. In 2016, WikiLeaks again came to prominence after exposing thousands of hacked emails of the Democratic National Committee, causing a possible setback for the US Democratic Party presidential candidate Hilary Clinton. WikiLeaks was then accused of collaborating with the Russian government to influence the US presidential elections, which Donald Trump, Clinton’s opponent, won.Shaken by the incriminating revelations on their modus operandi, Western nations, led by the US, launched an all-out war against Assange and WikiLeaks. Assange’s global legitimacy took a hit after Sweden’s abortive attempt to prosecute him for sexual allegations and the Ecuadorian Embassy’s allegation of rude behaviour while staying with them as a refugee-guest. Beyond the questions of his personal conduct, though, Assange continued to be considered a victim of the Western world’s crusade against the free press. Assange found his champions, among other global intellectuals, in Noam Chomsky and Arundhati Roy, both of whom condemned the US government’s anti-democratic attempts at silencing a journalist-crusader. In a strange turn of events, Roy, Indian writer known for speaking on behalf of the freedom of the country’s impoverished Adivasis and Dalits, now faces sedition charges in her home country for a speech she made in 2010. The hounding of Roy is a clear case of the Indian government, led by the right-wing strongman Narendra Modi, silencing dissenting voices. In Nepal, Kailash Sirohiya, the publisher of The Kathmandu Post, spent nine days in jail last month and continues to face prosecution for an alleged forgery of citizenship certificates while in reality, he is being hounded for his publication’s consistent coverage of the corruption allegations against Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane. The abuse of authority to silence journalists, intellectuals and dissenters is a global phenomenon today. Julian Assange’s ordeal is a reality check of the price one must pay for speaking truth to power.  \nIn the Secondary Education Examinations (SEE) conducted this year, over 52 percent of students failed to graduate to grade 11. The National Examination Board had enforced the ‘non-graded’ category from this year. The underperformance of the majority of school students has stirred a fresh debate about the test system. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with former National Planning Commission member Usha Jha, who led the committee that recommended the government to adopt the letter grading system.How do you analyse the SEE results published on Thursday?People have reacted to it with shock, not me. In fact, on the basis of the teaching system that is being practised in our schools, I think the results are good. We get the results based on what and how we teach students. Over 52 percent of students have been categorised as non-graded. We need to identify and address the causes behind the bad results. I have heard some people blame the letter grading system. This is wrong. A form of letter grading system was already there. We only suggested an upgraded form of the system. If we start blaming the system, we won’t find the real cause of the problem. What may be the real causes that you are hinting at?The first is the poor quality of teachers in our country. A form of letter grading system was there even before. But it had two loopholes. First, the government took an approach whereby all students would pass. That gave an impression to the students that they don’t need to study hard. That degraded the quality of their education. Second, there was a system of giving marks based on the students’ performances in theoretical and practical exams. Of the total 100 marks, the practical exams made up 35 marks. Most students were given maximum marks in the practical exams. That helped them get higher grades even if they didn’t do well in theoretical exams. This system encouraged students to neglect theoretical studies. That has caused huge damage to our education system. The letter grade system introduced this year has closed those loopholes. But the letter grading system requires a learning environment. The system was introduced without adequate preparation for its effective implementation. Also, the Covid pandemic disturbed preparatory works at the time. We should have drastically improved classroom teaching practices, and trained teachers across the country because their teaching methods are outdated. They weren’t trained on the grading system. They give lectures and encourage students to memorise while the letter grading system requires a thorough process and encourages result-oriented learning. It doesn’t prioritise marks. Our teachers and schools lacked the capacity to implement the new system. Teachers weren’t trained and prepared. Even now, most teachers don’t know what the letter grading system is. The system is necessary to make our students compete in global markets.While we upgraded the system, we didn’t upgrade the schools and teachers. Our teachers engage only in routine and formal responsibilities such as completing textbook courses before the examinations. This system should be properly internalised not only by teachers and students but also school management, palikas [local units] and parents of the students. Only then can it be effectively implemented. These are the major reasons behind the poor results. How is the students’ performance evaluated in the letter grading system?First, teachers should study a lot. They take reference of the subject matter from the textbook and teach students giving a broader perspective of the matter. They have to engage the students practically on the issue. The students should be regularly evaluated based on their participation and response in study and activities. The teachers should teach them and constantly monitor whether they are learning and making progress. The marking should be based on that. So, in this system, the examination starts from day 1 and everyday activities contribute to their marks. It also takes other activities such as behaviour, understanding, presentation into consideration. Therefore, it is called a regular assessment system based on a thorough process, unlike the traditional three-hour-long yearly examination method. If the teachers aren’t competent to carry out these activities, this idea can’t yield good results. They badly need capacity enhancement. The pedagogy should be remodelled.What was the rationale behind the decision to implement this system?One reason was to upgrade our education’s standard on par with the international standards and make our students fit for global markets. In the course of formulating this policy, we undertook a comprehensive research of international practices. Based on that evidence-based research, we submitted a report to then education minister Giriraj Mani Pokharel. The government studied and endorsed it. Basically, this system was introduced with an objective of upgrading our education system in the changed context. But we lacked preparations to implement this idea.We will make a mistake if we change this system. I heard that the education minister [Sumana Shrestha] decided to make some changes in the policy and allow all non-graded students to sit for chance examinations, whereas the system says only those students who secured non-grades in two subjects can retake exams for the same subjects. There is no point in changing the method to favour even the students who have failed in all the subjects. She should have made it clear what factors made her change the criteria overnight. I cannot understand why the minister made the decision in a haste without considering its impact.In fact, our next step should have been capacity enhancement of teachers. The minister took some right decisions such as separating teachers from political parties. But an incumbent minister changing a system that was implemented by a previous minister would cause a problem. She could have formed a panel to conduct a study to find if the letter grading system is the main cause behind the students’ underperformance. But changing a policy through an order didn’t look good.Results show our students are very poor in mathematics, science and English. What could be the reasons?This is unfortunate. We saw similar trends in previous years as well. Mathematics and science are becoming more challenging. One reason is the lack of sufficient teachers for these subjects. Also, some teachers are under-utilised. Some teachers don’t go to the schools. So special measures need to be taken to manage teachers mainly for these subjects. Otherwise, we will have similar results in the coming years.The committee under your leadership recommended that those getting a GPA below 1.6 have to choose technical courses and those willing to study Grade 11 must score above 1.6 GPA. What was the idea behind that recommendation?The idea was to end the situation of halting students’ study and activities because of their lower grades. We have a government body in the form of the Council for Technical Education and Vocational Training (CTEVT) which has been offering dozens of vocational training based on the needs and interests of people. So our youths can join a suitable CTEVT course. We need more people in vocational fields. Skilled people aren’t available in the country. A large number of people working in technical fields in Nepal are from India. We included the provision in consultation with CTEVT officials. Minister Giriraj Mani Pokharel had also prepared a broad plan to implement the letter grading system and integrate the vocational part in our education system. The present government should improve the education system by enhancing teachers’ capacity and encouraging youths to join vocational training to fill the gaps in the employment market. Are the infrastructure and resources available in our education system sufficient to implement the grading system?Some schools lack even essential resources while in some we find misuse or underuse of resources. So, our education ministry should carry out a comprehensive mapping and find where teachers are required, where they are underutilised and where they are idle. Then, the government can make optimum use of the teachers and make additional investment on need-basis. Such an approach will yield better results. In general, our academic institutions lack resources as there is a trend of allocating insufficient budgets for the education sector. Yes, the letter grading system needs more investment. We have to work on teachers’ capacity enhancement and to provide learning materials to students. When you make an activity participatory, you certainly need resources and investments.Do we need to review our teacher recruitment process and our pedagogy in the universities that produce teachers?The government can consider new requirements while recruiting teachers and train them accordingly. Also, we need to update our curriculum and pedagogy for courses such as BEd and MEd to produce quality teachers. I have doubts about the quality of our graduates, post-graduates and even PhD holders due to the poor teaching and learning environment of our academic institutions. There is a need for more coordination and collaboration between the government and universities to address such issues.In the end, I want to stress that the government should adopt a clear and consistent policy and avoid ad-hoc decisions. The letter grading system is the best and we should push for that despite the challenges in its implementation. Just that it should have been enforced after enhancing teachers’ capacity. The problems we have now are due to lack of preparation. \nThe government’s recent decision to recall ambassadors, particularly Nepal’s envoy to India, just ahead of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s visit to New Delhi, courted widespread controversy. What are the takeaways of the prime minister’s Delhi visit? What is the progress in implementing the trade and transit agreement signed with China and with the BRI projects? Thira Lal Bhusal of the Post sat down with Rupak Sapkota, foreign affairs advisor to the prime minister, for some insights.The government’s decision to recall ambassadors from 11 countries at once has come under heavy criticism. Why did the government take such a decision?In general, it has become a practice of sorts to recall incumbent ambassadors and appoint new ones after changes in the government or in the ruling coalition. This has both merits and demerits. The country’s foreign policy doesn’t change with a change in government. But every government and coalition has its specific policies, programmes and priorities. Therefore, even other countries make changes in political appointments as per the government’s priorities. Our case is a bit different. Ruling coalitions are frequently changed, and so are ambassadors. As there is a high chance of our politics being governed by coalitions given our electoral system, it has become necessary to establish a rational system on ambassadorial appointment. Either the political appointees themselves should voluntarily quit the job and return home just like vice-chair and members of the National Planning Commission do. Or there should be a consensus among major political forces to allow our ambassadors to serve out the full term.The second option of allowing ambassadors to serve out their term sounds better, doesn’t it?Definitely. Some initiatives have been taken with the objective of making our diplomatic appointments more prestigious, merit-based and better-managed. The government in 2019 introduced some criteria on ambassadorial appointments. We have to put more effort into ensuring that our ambassadorial appointees have the capacity to effectively carry out diplomatic duties. Once we establish a system of appointing envoys based on merit and not out of political biases, we can create a situation of allowing them to serve for the full term. Then, a change of coalition wouldn’t affect their continuity. We need to develop such a political consensus, given our geopolitical sensitivity.But the ambassadors appointed in recent years and their activities in host countries have lowered the bar of our diplomacy.We have seen rapid and huge changes in power equations in the world. In view of that, we can see some countries have appointed former ministers and even prime ministers as envoys to the countries with whom they have vital relations. They also appoint such personalities as envoys for a special mission. So, we have to think about ambassadorial appointments from different perspectives based on the changed context. It is high time that all the political forces and leaders agree on a basic point that those who have in-depth understanding and expertise of the field and can work for the best interest of the country will be appointed the country’s ambassadors. If the individual is competent, the person’s affiliation to a political party may not be a problem. But whether the person can work in the best interest of the country must be considered before appointment.But the government itself doesn’t seem serious about maintaining diplomatic decorum. For instance, the June 6 Cabinet meeting decided to recall the ambassador from India just days ahead of the prime minister’s New Delhi visit. There were also reports that the prime minister made the decision reluctantly due to pressure from coalition partners. What is the real story?It is nothing more than a coincidence. There were discussions about making changes in the ambassadorial positions in line with the March 4 changes in the ruling coalition. But it was deferred as the government needed to accomplish some important tasks and convene events such as the investment summit. When the government decided to change our ambassadors, it just happened to coincide with the prime minister’s visit to New Delhi to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It was a coincidence. Despite the decision, the ambassador had sufficient time to properly conclude all his engagements and duties there. The way he facilitated the process during the prime minister’s visit doesn’t reflect any misgivings about the government’s decision. So, it should be taken as a course that is in keeping with our tradition. In recent decades, other countries have given top priority to economic diplomacy, but the selection of our envoys and their activities doesn’t reflect that. Why aren’t we thinking in that direction?Yes, diplomacy in the past used to be one-dimensional, or it was conducted mainly by one particular ministry—the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. These days, many other ministries are engaged with international agencies. Economic diplomacy, labour diplomacy, climate diplomacy and security affairs have become crucial. We have to increase coordination, cooperation and collaboration among relevant agencies to make our international relations more fruitful and in line with the policies and goals set by our government.We have seen profound changes in terms of approaches, perspectives and dynamics of diplomacy in recent decades. All countries have started to give more importance to the competence of diplomats also in view of the increased geopolitical competition and rivalry seen between world powers. Rapid innovation in science and technology has not only eased our lives but also added challenges. We have to handle so many diplomatic engagements. Similarly, the number of international forums where we have to engage are increasing. These days, multilateral diplomacy and engagements have become as important. Even minilateral forums have started to play vital roles in international relations as the world powers have adopted multiple strategies to create their spheres of influence. In the meantime, the role of public diplomacy has become influential. So, a diplomat today must be dynamic and efficient enough to grasp the international situation, understand the sensitivity of the host country, articulate our country’s views efficiently and work in national interest. Therefore, it has become vital to be extra careful while selecting ambassadors.You talked about better coordination but we don’t see any correction in the practice of bypassing the foreign ministry while working with international agencies.Definitely, the foreign ministry is our focal point for all international relations conducted by a ministry or agency of our country. There should be no dispute about that. We need to make the foreign ministry more resourceful. Then, the ministry will have more capacity and efficiency to handle issues related to security, finance, labour and climate.Why have we failed to maintain reciprocity in terms of diplomats’ relations with the leaders of host countries? For example, our ambassadors in some capitals don’t get to meet the host leaders for years while the foreign envoys in Kathmandu can meet our prime minister and foreign minister directly and instantly.We have to see it from two perspectives. One is the power structure. In international relations, we can see the reflection of the asymmetric power relations between the big powers and other countries. The more developed and resourceful country’s influence in a host country can be seen and felt. Second, despite being an envoy from an underdeveloped or a small country, one can have diplomatic relations based on the principle of sovereign equality. It depends on the individual diplomat as well.In Kathmandu, we often err when dealing with foreign envoys. We have to decide what level of importance to give them. Therefore, some initiatives have been taken to correct and maintain consistency by implementing a diplomatic code of conduct that aims to integrate all activities through the foreign ministry. Foreign envoys will follow the system if we implement it consistently, irrespective of changes in the government. For that, there should be a political understanding at the national level.Let’s move to Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s recent India visit. Though it was mainly to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Indian Prime Minister Modi, he held some important political meetings. What are the takeaways from the visit?The visit was important from bilateral, regional and international perspectives. Traditionally, foreign affairs was described as an extended form of domestic affairs. But these days, international affairs have influence over domestic affairs as well. So such meetings and dialogues at the prime minister’s level are important. They exchanged views in a very cordial atmosphere. Of late, we have maintained bilateral dialogues at the political level on a regular basis and that has helped remove misunderstandings. Our prime minister’s emphasis is to hold bilateral dialogues both at the political as well as diplomatic levels in order to settle differences. India has taken this spirit positively.Second, the two prime ministers discussed how to expedite the implementation of the agreements reached between Nepal and India during Prime Minister Dahal’s official visit a year ago. The issue was discussed during the meeting between Prime Minister Dahal and Indian External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar as well. They also expressed satisfaction over progress in the implementation of bilateral agreements mainly in energy trade, connectivity and investment. In recent years, we have seen progress in investment, economic and trade sectors. Yet we still have some differences on border issues. That is an important and positive development in Nepal-India relations in recent years. In the past, when we had some differences on political, border or other issues, that used to badly affect other aspects of our relations. But now, both the countries agree to resolve outstanding issues through dialogue and our trade and all other affairs are moving ahead smoothly. This is the encouraging part of our relations. But border disputes can sour our relations anytime, right? Is there a sense of urgency to resolve it once and for all?The prime minister is for activating the concerned bilateral mechanisms to resolve such issues. He has also invited Indian Prime Minister Modi to visit Nepal. We can expect the Indian prime minister’s Nepal visit in near future. We can make some progress in resolving some outstanding matters such as border issues during the high level visit. I believe we will move ahead in this direction.Any progress on submitting the report of the Eminent Persons’ Group?During the meetings, the prime minister raised overall bilateral issues that include the matter related to the EPG report. I think once the mechanisms are activated and start working, that will create a situation for the report’s submission.Nepal and Bangladesh are completing homework for greater energy trade. India’s facilitation is a must for that. Is there any progress on securing the southern neighbour’s support for that?Progress in energy cooperation is a major achievement of this tenure of the prime minister. The progress is not limited to the bilateral level but goes to the regional level. A Cabinet committee of the Bangladesh government earlier this month approved a proposal to import 40 megawatts of electricity from Nepal. At present, we will use India’s infrastructure to export energy to Bangladesh. But for the long term there is a plan to build a dedicated transmission line for that. This shows it is not only Nepal that is interested in exporting its energy but other countries in this region are also interested in importing Nepal’s electricity. We have also signed an agreement to build a cross border transmission line with China. The doors are being opened for regional trade of our energy. This development will make India more open to importing energy from Nepal.Why are we failing to expedite projects under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) of China?The economic cooperation between Nepal and China has substantially increased after we joined the BRI framework. So, Nepal has been benefitting from the BRI. We see some concern about the lack of progress on certain infrastructure projects to be built under the BRI framework. In fact, we are in a better position to implement the projects because now we can decide what kind of BRI projects are good for us based on the experience of project development and implementation under the BRI in other countries.We are working to finalise the BRI implementation agreement. Nepal wants to move ahead by signing the implementation agreement and developing the projects. Nepal joined the BRI framework based on its need to diversify trade and connect to the world market. The reality is the same now. So, we need to sign the implementation plan and move ahead as soon as possible. When I attended the Boao Forum a few months ago, I found the Chinese authorities and other stakeholders holding debates to build quality and resilient infrastructure. They also have plans to support the capacity enhancement of human resources and transfer technology in the BRI member countries.People mainly link the BRI with big infrastructure projects such as railway, road and transmission connectivity but there is no significant progress on these fronts. What are the roadblocks?In Nepal, no big infrastructure project has been completed on time, be it the Melamchi drinking project, airports, hydropower or road projects. We haven’t developed the capacity to build big projects, and we don’t envision any plan to operate after building it. So, not only with China but also with other countries and agencies, we have to seek support for small and medium-size projects that we can efficiently build and operate. Also, the third version of the BRI action plan has included building not only big but small and smart projects under the framework. We have to push for that. As we build our capacity, we can gradually take up big projects. For instance, now we can build big hydro projects on our own. It wasn’t the case until some years ago. We developed expertise in hydropower by building many small projects in the past few decades and gradually enhanced our capacity. We have already faced problems in operating the Pokhara and Bhairahawa airports. Is there any progress in taking Chinese support to operate the airports?We have to see both aspects—domestic as well as international use—of the airports. The two airports have helped us upgrade the quality of our domestic air travel as the passengers have benefited due to the upgraded infrastructure. The number of domestic passengers in these airports has increased significantly.It is true that there is no progress in terms of operating them as international airports. The government is studying all possibilities of their use based on their unique features. We are exploring various options in international markets to attract adventure tourists to Pokhara. Chinese stakeholders are also holding some promotional activities in Pokhara. Chinese authorities have told us that they are consulting with their provincial bodies and exploring possibilities to run regular flights to Pokhara. Similarly, the government is mobilising our embassies and other stakeholders in certain countries having a large number of Buddhist tourists to operate flights to Bhairahawa, and we have received some positive responses. I believe we will be able to operate regular international flights from these two airports soon.It’s been eight years since we signed the trade and transit agreement with China, which was touted as a historic deal between the two countries. Why haven’t we been able to implement it?Some symbolic steps have been taken in this period. For instance, a shipment was received from a third country [Vietnam] using a Chinese port in September last year. Similar other initiatives have been taken but these are limited to symbolic gestures. We have to prepare infrastructure and some legal basis to implement the agreements in a more result-oriented way. A bilateral meeting is being held this week. The meeting is likely to discuss how to bring the trade and transit protocol in an effective way. This meeting will discuss various issues faced so far and will also pave the way forward. We have also proposed to form a ministerial-level mechanism to oversee overall bilateral issues. The upcoming meeting will sort out various issues.The Chinese side was conducting a feasibility study of the Keirung-Kathmandu cross-border railway project. What is the progress?There is progress in various projects that we are carrying out with Chinese support. The cross-border railway feasibility study is in the final stage. Likewise, the study on the Chhahare-Tokha tunnel project is ongoing. A Chinese team is arriving to conduct a feasibility study of the Hilsa-Simkot road. A process to award a contract to build a friendly bridge at Hilsa with Chinese grants has begun. A foundation stone will be laid there soon. Also, a study to build the Chilime-Rashuwagadhi-Keirung 220kV cross-border transmission line is beginning soon. \nThe mandatory use of National ID cards for government services has ignited controversy, with concerns about delayed card distribution while the government emphasizes its benefits in streamlining data, combating fraud, and enhancing security.\nDespite adopting a federal system in 2015, Nepal faces challenges in implementing the system effectively due to centralized practices, lack of clarity, and political instability, as per Prithvi Subba Gurung, former Gandaki chief minister.\nA parliamentary committee was formed to investigate a cooperative scam, with a task force led by Jiban Pariyar finalizing its terms of reference after extensive negotiations, despite resistance from the ruling parties to include Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane's name in the investigation's scope.\nRain with thunder and lightning is anticipated Tuesday, with heavy rainfall in several Bagmati, Gandaki, Lumbini, Karnali, and Sudur Pashchim provinces, while one or two locations in Gandaki and Lumbini may experience very heavy rainfall.\nExpect cloudy weather with light to moderate rain, thunderstorms, and potential heavy rainfall in Koshi, Bagmati, Gandaki, and Sudur Pashchim Provinces, with warnings issued for very heavy rainfall in some areas.\nMostly cloudy weather with light to moderate rain and potential for heavy rainfall in parts of Koshi, Bagmati, Gandaki, and Sudurpashchim provinces; temperatures range from 15.5°C to 37.4°C.\nCloudy weather, light to moderate rain, and heavy rainfall in some provinces of Nepal are expected today and tonight, with temperatures ranging from 16.3°C (Jumla) to 38.6°C (Nepalgunj).\n\nBe elaborative as possible.

Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nA day after the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML sealed a deal to form a new political alliance and decided to amend some provisions of the constitution, Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who was largely left out of the new power-sharing process, has refused to step down from the post.The political fraternity has been divided over the new understanding between the Nepali Congress and the UML. But the prime minister’s decision to cling on and seek a vote of confidence is set to delay the process of forming a new government, which will be led by UML chairman KP Sharma Oli as per the understanding. On Tuesday, a UML secretariat meeting requested all political parties to join the new government of ‘national consensus’ and contribute to political stability. As per the Congress-UML understanding to form the government under Article 76 (2) of the constitution, the UML meeting also called on the prime minister to pave the way by Wednesday evening.“The meeting endorsed the agreement reached between the Congress and the UML,” Pradeep Gyawali, deputy general secretary of the UML, said after the meeting. Contrary to widespread expectations, the UML has decided to delay its earlier plan to immediately recall ministers from the Dahal Cabinet. “We don’t want more animosity [against the Maoist Centre] and so we did not recall our ministers today,” Gyawali said. “But if the prime minister does not pave the way for new government formation by tomorrow [Wednesday] evening, we will recall our ministers and take other necessary steps.”“If the prime minister ignores UML’s request [to quit], our party will withdraw its support to the government.”The party has eight ministers in the Dahal Cabinet. The UML has also given a reason for its decision to sever ties with Dahal. “The prime minister was in talks with the Congress for a month in order to form a national consensus government, which created a situation of mistrust,” said Gyawali. “This ultimately forced us to initiate talks with the Nepali Congress.” After Congress rejected Dahal’s proposal, the UML and Congress started talking seriously to unseat Dahal, according to Gyawali. “The UML and the Congress started talking and decided to move ahead together for political stability and democratic exercise,” he said. The UML meeting also endorsed the understanding with the Congress, expressing hope that a new government would ensure political stability, help mend the crisis-ridden economy, and address growing public frustration. Gyawali said his party had no plans to ditch the current coalition despite some internal issues. “We were prepared to give continuity to the government. But some interesting developments started unfolding in national politics. The prime minister started discussions about forming a national government without consulting anyone, prompting us to question the objective and necessity of such a government,” said Gyawali. He also recounted Dahal’s history of kicking out the UML from the government within just 15 days of government formation last year. “So we became suspicious of the prime minister,” said Gyawali, “But Nepali Congress did not accept the prime minister’s request this time.” As the picture of the new government remains unclear, there is also confusion over Cabinet formation and discussions about power-sharing between the Nepali Congress, UML and other parties. “On Cabinet formation, we have reached a broad understanding with the UML, but we are yet to finalise the names of ministers,” a Congress office bearer told the Post. Besides the UML, the Congress has also separately asked the prime minister to step down. On Monday midnight, Nepali Congress chief Sher Bahadur Deuba and UML chair Oli also agreed to form a high-powered constitution review committee to suggest amendments to the constitution, bypassing key ruling partners like the CPN (Maoist Centre) and the Rastriya Swatantra Party.Besides the Nepali Congress and the UML, other parties like the Rastriya Prajatantra Party, Loktantrik Samajbadi Party, Janata Samajbadi Party (Upendra Yadav faction) have welcomed the new deal. Deuba, according to one Congress leader, also met CPN (Unified Socialist) chair Madhav Kumar Nepal on Tuesday evening and asked him to join the new political process. Nepal responded that he would discuss the matter in the party. The CPN (Maoist Centre), the Rastriya Swatantra Party, and the CPN (Unified Socialist) have opposed the deal. The RSP, a key party in the government, said that it would remain in the government so long as the prime minister stays in office. After the deal with the Congress, Oli met Prime Minister Dahal on Tuesday morning and asked him to step down, but Dahal refused to do so, according to Maoist Centre leaders. Dahal, after meeting Oli, convened a meeting of the party’s secretariat, where he discussed the latest political situation and updated party leaders on his interactions with Oli and Deuba in the past few days. Devendra Poudel, the Maoist Centre party secretary, said it has been decided that the prime minister will not resign and he will instead seek a vote of confidence in the House.In the meeting, Dahal was reportedly angry with Oli, whom Dahal accused of betraying him. “Deuba showed political culture, but not Oli,” Dahal said in the meeting. “I didn’t expect such a move from Oli with whom I had very cordial talks even until Monday afternoon.”“We are not escaping, and we are not afraid,” said Devendra Poudel. “We have decided to deal with the situation politically.”Dahal went to meet President Ram Chandra Poudel on Tuesday and informed the President that he would follow the constitutional course. Dahal advised the President to call for government formation based on Article 76 (3) of the constitution, according to which the leader of the single largest party in the House of Representatives—Deuba in this case—will be called to form a new government. The Maoist Centre has also objected to the understanding between the Congress and the UML on amending the constitution, terming it a ‘regressive’ step. Dahal told the President that he would follow the constitution, which means he will face a no-confidence motion in the House. As per Article 100 of the constitution, the prime minister will have 30 days to seek a vote of confidence.When the decision to withdraw support reaches Parliament, the date for seeking a vote of confidence will be fixed as per parliamentary regulations.“Seeking a vote of confidence is the prerogative of the prime minister and so he is not bound to resign,” said Bipin Adhikari, an expert on constitutional matters. “Tendering resignation is his choice but seeking a vote of confidence within 30 days of a party withdrawing support is his constitutional right.”A senior UML leader told the Post that Oli wants to be the prime minister under Article 76 (2).If no political party commands a majority in the House, the President can call for government formation under Article 76 (2).“In cases where no party has a clear majority in the House of Representatives under clause (1), the President shall appoint as the Prime Minister a member of the House of Representatives who can command a majority with the support of two or more parties representing the House of Representatives,” says the Article.The spirit of this Article is to provide a strong and stable government, said Adhikari, and so the President can call for government formation under this Article.“We are consulting on what to do and exploring legal options in case the prime minister declines to step down or delays the vote of confidence,” a Congress office bearer told the Post.As per the understanding, Oli will lead a new ‘national consensus’ government for a year and a half. For the remaining term of Parliament, Deuba will be the prime minister. Both parties have also tentatively reached a power-sharing deal, including on division of ministerial portfolios, amendments to the constitution, review of the electoral system, including proportional representation, change of national assembly arrangements, and the size of provincial assemblies, according to the understanding reached between the two sides.As per the draft understanding, the Congress will lead 10 ministries, including home, and the UML nine, including finance. Likewise, the Congress and the UML will lead three provincial governments each, with the government in Madhesh to be led by a regional party.  \nThe two major parties, the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, reached a written agreement on Monday to form a new government. Although the leaders of both the parties said they have agreed to amend the constitution, the agreement document is reportedly silent on it. “Leaders of two parties have agreed in principle to amend the constitution, but the amendment has not been included in the power-sharing agreement,” a Congress leader who is closely associated with the latest political developments told the Post on the condition of anonymity. “We are still discussing how to make changes to the constitution.” Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba informed his party leaders during a meeting on Tuesday morning that they have decided to amend the constitution, as per the party insider.The midnight deal between the Congress and the UML on Monday, however, has decided that UML chair KP Sharma Oli will lead the government for the first half of the remaining term of Parliament. “On Monday, the two parties essentially agreed on three major points,” a UML leader closely involved in the political developments told the Post. “To form a stable government, to address the country’s economic crisis, and new government leadership.” The UML leader also confirmed that there is no written agreement on amending the constitution. However, he claimed that the constitution amendment will happen in due course after the formation of the Congress-UML government.UML General Secretary Shankar Pokharel also claimed that the new Congress-UML government plans to amend the constitution to ensure political stability. After the agreement on power-sharing between Congress and UML on Monday night, the general secretary wrote on social media that a ‘national consensus government’ would be formed under Oli’s leadership. “There is an agreement to form a government of national consensus under Oli's leadership to amend the constitution for political stability and draft laws accordingly,” Pokharel wrote.Although they are yet to disclose the proposed amendments, both Congress and UML leaders have been questioning the relevance of the current electoral system. So long as the electoral system (a mix of direct and proportional elections) remains, no single party will secure a majority, therefore, the two parties have decided to change the electoral system, according to leaders of the two parties the Post spoke with. In the UML, there is a strong opinion that for a party to be a national party, the minimum vote threshold should increase from 3 percent to 5 percent of the total valid votes cast under the proportional category, says a UML leader. When it comes to the electoral system, the Congress leaders are not happy with the proportional electoral system.Since the first constituent assembly election in 2008, Nepal has been practising a mixed electoral system in which 60 percent of representatives are elected through direct election, whereas 40 percent are elected through proportional representation. “If we start amending the constitution, the process might not stop at changing the electoral system,” says former Chief Election Commissioner Nilkantha Uprety. He terms the proportional system as a big political achievement and says it should be continued.“We introduced this system to ensure proportional representation of all groups and communities in the country,” Uprety told the Post. “The system is still very relevant in the Nepali context.” Just changing the electoral system does not ensure political stability, Uprety said. “I hope our political parties give serious thought to the things that the country needs to change and the things it needs to keep constant,” he added. “We should avoid going back to a pre-2008 state when there was no proportional representation.”While the two party leaders are planning to amend the constitution to give the country a semblance of stability, a two-thirds majority in both the lower and upper house is needed to amend the charter. This means 184 seats in the 275-strong federal parliament. Not just that. In any matter related to any of the seven provinces, the provincial legislatures must also approve the amendments, again with two-thirds majority. Though the Congress and the UML, largest parties in Parliament with 88 and 78 seats, have joined hands to form the government, they will still need the support of 18 more lawmakers to achieve a two-thirds majority in the lower house. And in the 59-member upper house, the two parties will need the backing of every party except the CPN (Maoist Centre) to secure a two-thirds (40 votes) majority, to amend the constitution. “The constitution amendment will not happen in haste. It is a long process that the Congress-UML government will accomplish in time,” says Gyanendra Bahadur Karki, Congress leader.“If the two largest parties decide to amend the constitution, I believe we will be able to muster the numbers in both the Houses,” Karki told the Post.Meanwhile, the Maoist Centre has seen the agreement between the Congress and UML to amend the constitution with suspicion. A Maoist Centre meeting held at Baluwatar on Tuesday morning interpreted the amendment proposal as the two largest parties questioning the current political system in the name of seeking political stability.“Where will the constitutional amendment lead us?” the secretary of Maoist Centre, Devendra Paudel, asked. “If the constitutional amendment was that necessary, it could also have been done close to the next election cycle.”  \nNepal’s second international airport, inaugurated in the country’s south in May 2022, has seen no international flights for a year and a half now.Locals, businesses, and hoteliers had high hopes for the Gautam Buddha International Airport, the gateway to Lumbini, the birthplace of the Buddha, to transform the economic landscape of the province. With no flights coming in anytime soon, they have again appealed to the federal government to prepare a workable strategy to operate it.A government official at the National Statistics Office recently told the Post that Lumbini Province suffered a recession this year, with most shops shuttered due to low business activity.On Monday, the private sector representatives of Rupandehi, Kapilvastu, and Nawalparasi West appealed to the members of parliament to sketch a business plan to operate the airport and revive Lumbini's economy.Members of a subcommittee formed by the parliamentary Public Accounts Committee to probe the alleged irregularities while constructing the airport are inspecting it.At an interaction on Monday, local stakeholders and private sector representatives said that the airport inaugurated more than two years ago saw a few flights until the end of 2022 but no airline served it again.The participants said that with the airport, built at an investment of nearly Rs40 billion, remaining quiet, billions of private sector investment is at risk. For a long time, the private sector has clamoured for international flights. Industry entrepreneurs, traders, people’s representatives, and civil society leaders demanded the government do something about it.“The government should realise that there are areas outside Kathmandu also that need its attention,” said Thakur Kumar Shrestha, president of the Siddhartha Chamber of Commerce and Industry.He questioned the subcommittee’s intent.“If they [parliamentary members] have come here aiming to operate the airport, there is a need for a policy-level decision to make the new airport viable.”Yogesh Bhattarai, coordinator of the subcommittee, and eight members of the Public Accounts Committee reached the airport for inspection. During the discussion, the lawmakers admitted the government's lapses and lack of seriousness about operating the new airport, which has pushed private investments to the brink.“We have been in serious trouble,” Shrestha said.“The government has not even discussed the new airport with ambassadors from various countries. Besides, people have to visit Kathmandu to get labour permits. If all works are performed from the Capital, how can the new airport operate,” Shrestha said.Chandra Prakash Shrestha, president of the Siddhartha Hotel Association, said that the government has already spent more than Rs40 billion for the construction of the airport.The private sector has already invested Rs80 billion in hotels and restaurants, hoping that the airport's operation will increase the number of tourists.“The entrepreneurs who took loans from banks are in trouble. The situation is getting worse day by day,” Shrestha said. “Despite the pressure from the private sector for a long time, the government has done nothing.”Shrestha said that to start international flights, the Kathmandu-centric activities need to be decentralised. “We are pressuring it continuously, but the government does not listen.”Bishnu Paudel, former finance minister, said resuming international flights from Bhairahawa was missing from the government's agenda. “It is off the government’s working list to operate the airport. That is why there are no flights.”Paudel said the government has not invited international airlines to fly from the airport. “If the airport does not come into operation, it will feed a bad development narrative.”Paudel said the airport needs to be operated at full capacity in an organised way. Essential preparations should have started as soon as construction began, but it is already too late now.Bhattarai said that tourism entrepreneurs, industry entrepreneurs, and civil society feel that the airport needs to be operational without further delay. “We have collected the feedback, and the subcommittee will suggest that the government create a conducive environment for international flights.”“We are taking information regarding the investment, its need and design and construction, including the government’s investment and operation plan,” Bhattarai said.On Monday morning, the subcommittee discussed the matter with the chief of airport management, immigration, customs, and airport security agency.“We have asked the airport management many questions. Some have been answered, some have not,” said Bhattarai. \nThe COVAX facility, the United Nations-backed international vaccine-sharing scheme, has been supplying vaccine doses to Nepal for the last three days.Officials said that the vaccine is part of the 1.6 million doses the facility has committed to supply to the country in 2024.“We received 46,000 doses on the first day,” said Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the immunisation section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “Vaccine doses arrived yesterday and today too.”The COVAX-supplied vaccine doses are Pfizer-BioNTech monovalent vaccines, including the children’s vaccine. The monovalent or single component is designed for the Omicron variant XBB.1.5 of SARS-CoV-2.Officials said that the vaccine doses will be administered to the vulnerable groups, including pregnant women, those having compromised immunity, people suffering from chronic diseases and children having compromised immunity.Officials say around 100,000 vaccine doses will be administered to children between five and 11 having compromised immunity, including those suffering from cancer, HIV and other chronic diseases.They said that administration of vaccine doses is likely to start in the last week of July.Last month, Nepal confirmed the spread of the Covid sub-lineages KP.1, KP.2, KP.3, and KP.4 in the country. All the sub-variants are offshoots of the Omicron variant, which is considered responsible for the surge in new Covid cases in the last few months.Hospitals in Kathmandu had reported a surge in serious cases of Covid infection in April. Doctors attending to the infected patients had said that elderly people and those with underlying conditions were getting severe.The COVAX facility supplied millions of doses of various brands of the coronavirus vaccine which were used to inoculate the majority of the country's population.Earlier, the facility used to supply Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent vaccine doses that included a component of the original virus strain as well as a part of the Omicron variant to provide broad protection against Covid.The vaccine is called a bivalent Covid shot as it contains two components—the original virus strain, and Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 sub-variants.Over 12,000 people died and hundreds of thousands were infected in the first, second and third waves of the Covid pandemic in Nepal. \nThe Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML sealed a mid-night deal on Monday agreeing to form a new government ousting Pushpa Kamal Dahal as prime minister.According to the deal, KP Sharma Oli, the UML chairman, will lead the coalition for the first half of the three-and-a-half years until the next election. He will hand over the premiership to Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, who will oversee the elections. However, how soon Oli will move into Baluwatar from Balkot will depend on Dahal’s decision.The UML, the senior coalition partner in the Dahal government, hasn’t recalled its ministers from the Cabinet. Nor has it withdrawn its support to the prime minister. Its secretariat meeting on Tuesday asked Dahal to clear the way for a national consensus government by resigning.\"We will look at other constitutional options [quitting the government and withdrawing the support] only if the prime minister refuses to quit,\" said Rajendra Gautam, the UML's publicity department chief.Countdown of the CPN (Maoist Centre)-led government will begin the day the UML withdraws its support. Dahal will then be left with two options: resign or face Parliament. An office bearer meeting of the Maoist Centre decided that the prime minister will not quit but go for the floor test.Any party that proves the majority in the House of Representatives leads the government, said Devendra Paudel, the Maoist Centre secretary. “The prime minister will not resign,” Paudel said. “He will take the constitutional course [opt for the vote of trust].”Article 100 (2) of the constitution states that if the political party the prime minister represents is divided or a political party in the coalition withdraws its support, the prime minister shall table a motion in the House of Representatives for a vote of confidence within 30 days.Dahal will have a month at most, from the day the UML withdraws its support, to go for the trust vote. It will be Dahal’s fifth floor test since he formed the post-election government in December 2022. Last time he faced Parliament was on May 20 after the Upendra Yadav-led Janata Samajbadi Party withdrew its support.As it is certain that he will lose the vote of confidence without the UML and the Congress backing him, the President will call for the formation of a new government with a two- to three-day deadline.The provision at hand is Article 76, which deals with government formation. There are four provisions in the constitution for appointing the prime minister. As no party has a majority, the President can call for the coalition government as per Article 76 (2).The article states that in cases where no party has a clear majority, the President shall appoint as prime minister “a member of the House who can command a majority with the support of two or more parties”.The first and the second largest parties, the Congress and the UML, have a combined strength of 167, much above the majority mark of 138 in the 275-member House. While the UML has 78 members excluding the Speaker, the Congress has 79.Senior advocate Dinesh Tripathi said there are rumors that the President has to initiate government formation as per Article 76 (3)—a minority government—if Dahal, who was appointed under Article 76 (2), fails the floor test.“This argument is incorrect. The President can call the parties to form a coalition government as per Article 72 (2) after Dahal fails the vote of confidence,” he said. “Several verdicts by the Supreme Court have clearly said that every available option for government formation can be used.”In its recent verdict to retain the Hikmat Karki-led government in Koshi Province, the top court said the same constitutional provision can be cited for more than once. Advocate Raju Prasad Chapagain, former chairperson of the Constitutional Lawyers’ Forum, said the Constitutional Bench made a similar ruling while overturning the twin decisions of Oli to dissolve the House of Representatives in December 2020 and May 2021.“There is no bar for the President to trigger government formation based on Article 76 (2),” said Chapagain. “He can make a call for a minority government as per Article 76 (3) only if a coalition government cannot be installed.” \nWhat has happened in Nepali politics in the past 48 hours—as in by late night of Tuesday, when this paper went to print—cannot be explained simply on the basis of mainstream political theory. In the intervening midnight of Monday and Tuesday, when most Nepalis were asleep, septuagenarians Sher Bahadur Deuba of the Nepali Congress and KP Sharma Oli of the CPN-UML sealed a deal to form a new government. Such is the distrust among the new coalition partners that they could not wait until daybreak to meet in their sophisticated offices or even drawing rooms to do so, as they chose the house of a businessman to decide the country’s future course.That the top leaders of the country’s two biggest political parties had to be brought together to form a new coalition government by an outsider exposes the degenerate nature of our politics. For now, let’s come back to the point about political theory failing to explain the drama that gets performed on the Nepali political stage in the name of constitution and democracy. Perhaps in order to explain the actions of the top three players of Nepali politics—Deuba, Oli, and Pushpa Kamal Dahal— political theorists would want to draw a bit from game theory, whereby the actions of a player are dependent on the possible strategies of another player.Other things being the same, the Dahal-led government is all but gone thanks to the Deuba-Oli midnight rendezvous. Dahal will likely be replaced by Oli, who will then make way for Deuba after a year and a half—if they stick to their promise. Whether the new marriage of the ideological opposites will survive depends on the checkmates they use against each other on the moral, policy-level and financial corruption committed by each other. The Giri Bandhu tea estate scandal and the fake Bhutanese refugees scandal, in which the UML and the Congress bigshots, respectively, are allegedly involved, are a case in point.In fact, the foundation for the new coalition was prophetically—or even pathetically—laid over three months ago during Dahal’s floor test in Parliament. Oli, while offering his support to Dahal, had signaled to Deuba of his interest in forming a coalition, to which Deuba had responded with a nod and a smile. It was not difficult to understand that Oli was not very happy to have struck a deal with Dahal, who is well-known for his propensity to change partners in a jiffy; nor was it difficult to get Deuba’s hope amid despair that either Dahal or Oli could come back to him at any point to form yet another coalition. After all, for our old leaders, changing coalition partners is a matter of convenience rather than conviction.If we are still looking for some silver lining amid the black cloud of political uncertainty, it is this: Dahal’s reputation as a kingmaker-turned-king with just 32 seats in a 275-strong parliament has taken a big jolt. The coming together of the two biggest parties of Parliament is never a good sign for parliamentary democracy, for that leaves us without a strong opposition. But in bringing Dahal to the ground at last, the Deuba-Oli duo has given a message that an electoral pigmy can no longer play a permanent badshah in the game of thrones that is Nepali politics.  \nIn most oligarchies of the world, power-sharing arrangements are negotiated behind the curtain and inked in darkness. The supremo of CPN-UML, Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli, is a habitual night owl—even a foreign spook, Samanta Goel, had to schedule a meeting with him late in the evening. Perhaps an astrologer suggested the leader of the largest party in Pratinidhi Sabha and the Chair of the Nepali Congress (NC), Sher Bahadur Deuba, to sign a pact with the supremo of the second-largest party in Parliament after midnight. The deal is finally sealed, and the foremost democratic force of the country will be collaborating with the dominant communist party to entrench an ethnocratic regime.Maoist supremo Dahal has been jumping from the NC camp to the UML platform and the other way round with the regularity of a hawker and the dexterity of an acrobat. He had swiftly set up a meeting with Sharma Oli to placate his senior partner in the coalition and offered to quit in favour of the latter to maintain the status quo. The permanent establishment of Nepal (PEON) seems to have scuttled his plans.The PEON has been vouching for a rapprochement between the NC and the UML for quite a while. Since the restoration of parliamentary democracy in 1990, these two parties have joined hands or taken turns ruling the country for much of the duration. They have much more at stake in maintaining the ethnonational oligarchy than the Maoists. When the influence of the two dominant parties was reduced in the Constituent Assembly elections of 2008, they had worked assiduously to have it dissolved through a judicial intervention. No matter how hard Dahal tried to propitiate the high priests of Khas-Arya hegemony—ritualistically worship a buffalo, don the Daura-Suruwal ensemble or offer prescribed prayers at the temple of Mahakal in Ujjain—he failed to win their confidence. In the eyes of ethnonational zealots, Dahal had unleashed the forces of dignity politics—Dalit empowerment, Janjati awakening and Madheshi autonomy—that must be put back in their places through regressive changes in the electoral system.The proponents of Dalit empowerment are still too weak to challenge the existing sociopolitical order. The fragmented and resigned Janjati groups lack the will to resist the hegemonic designs of Khas-Arya ethnonationalists. The only community that could have countered the resurgence of ethnonational majoritarianism was that of Madheshis. Sadly, a craving for the crumbs from the high table has turned most politicos of Madhesh-dependent parties from committed activists to devoted conformists.Externalised MadheshisIt’s difficult to name a Madheshi politician who played an important role in the governance of Nepal in the pre-republican era. Ram Narayan Mishra, a cabinet minister in the short-lived BP Koirala government, stands out as an exception. Put behind bars after the royal-military coup, Mishra remained incarcerated and was freed only to die from a terminal disease. Justice Aniruddha Prasad Singh, Justice Bhagwati Prasad Singh and politician Chaturbhuj Prasad Singh—the ABC Singhs of Saptari—did rise to the highest posts, but they were merely royal loyalists at the beck and call of their master.The restoration of parliamentary democracy brought a new set of political players that shared their ethnonational beliefs with those of the ousted regime. Mahendra Narayan Nidhi was perhaps the best Prime Minister this country never had because of ethnic prejudices among the NC ranks. Gajendra Narayan Singh tried hard to establish amity between Pahadis and Madheshis based on political equality and social dignity through his Sadbhavana platform. He was repeatedly booed in public.Just as in the absolutist Shah era (1960-90), under the name of Panchayat, the highest ambition of an upwardly mobile Madheshi was to ape the dominant community in dress, language and mannerism, and become a mimic man of a “true Nepali”. The violent campaigns of Maoists and counter-violence of the state forces in the aughties were dreadful, but they did succeed in establishing the recognition of diversity in the manufactured uniformity of national unity. It’s the experience of the marginalised and externalised communities between 1990 and 2008 that makes the prospect of a political settlement between the NC and the UML terrifying.Useful toolsWhen the UML emerged as a powerful force of the post-1990 order, its leaders found, to their chagrin, that their presence in Madhesh was limited to the Pahadi community. They wanted Madheshi youths to build their organisation in a region that the NC had traditionally dominated. Ambitious Madheshis also discovered that they had little chance to rise fast in the NC, which was a party in the tight grip of the old guard. In addition to being ambitious, Upendra Yadav also possesses a sharp mind. He was already a foot soldier of the communist radicals, and when they constituted themselves into a parliamentary party as the UML, he became its low-level apparatchik.Yadav used his uncanny ability of sensing the direction of the wind and jumped on the Maoist bandwagon but remained carefully clear of direct armed confrontations. Contentions are often based on inferences, but the allegation that the non-party Madheshi Janadhikar Forum was constituted to counter the Madhesh Mukti Morcha of the Maoists with the covert support of the PEON doesn’t look too far-fetched. Barely active in anti-monarchy protests before 2006, Yadav became the public face of the Madhesh Uprising 2007, which challenged and beat the Maoists at their own game of violent propaganda. He then lost little time in making peace with his former enemies of the Gaur Massacre and became the messiah of sorts in Madhesh after the formation of the first Constituent Assembly in Nepal's history.In much of South Asia, people vote for their caste rather than casting their votes. Yadav prioritised caste solidarity over political affiliations and helped elect Ram Baran Yadav of the NC as the first President of the new republic. The PEON now had a new Yadav face to show in Madhesh and a pliant tool to control the polity and society. The political perseverance and tenacity of Upendra Yadav are admirable, but he seems resigned to his marginalisation after the overt entry of CK Raut into the electoral arena. The masters like to change their horses not just for utility but also for fun. The Yadavs remain the dominant caste in the entire Tarai-Madhesh and are the single largest group with 15.2 percent of the population in Madhesh province. However, an assertion of non-Yadav solidarity between what are colloquially termed the other backward classes (OBCs) and the extremely backward classes (EBCs) castes had necessitated the nurturing of a sufficiently rebellious but conveniently compliant face from the group to counter the possible consolidation of Muslim-Yadav (MY) alliance in Madhesh.Since its formation, the Loktantrik Samajbadi Party (LSP) has always been a loose coalition of predominantly upper-caste and primarily comfortable class of politicians in a patron-client relationship with their relatively reliable vote banks. They have little incentive to engage in combative politics.Perhaps it will take a while for Madheshi politicos to realise that conformity breeds contempt, and confrontation with the majoritarian ethnonationalists for political equality, economic justice and social dignity is the only way of making a mark on history.  \nWith the Copa América, the UEFA European Championship and the Olympic Games all taking place over a few months, summer 2024 is shaping up to be a celebration of sport.However, many modern sporting events have been held in countries with appalling human rights records, with little pushback from fans, broadcasters or governments. In a world where celebrities are held to high moral standards—and face consequences for falling short—this inconsistency is striking.My historical research focuses on this troubling issue, aiming to understand why sport often evades the scrutiny we so readily apply to other events and individuals.Qatar 2022For years before its first match began, the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar was marred by accusations of sportswashing, environmental damage, exorbitant costs and, most critically, severe human rights abuses—including the country’s treatment of women, the LGBTQ+ community and migrant workers.Among these widely reported allegations was one especially harrowing statistic: over 6,500 migrant workers from India, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh died while building hotels and stadiums in preparation for the 2022 World Cup. This means that each minute of football played at the tournament equated to the loss of one human life.While the Qatari government put the death toll far lower, at 47, these abuses were no secret in the run up to the event. Still, they had little impact on public opinion—in the weeks leading up to the tournament, fans were more concerned about how the winter timetable would affect the regular football season, or their ability to consume alcohol in a Muslim country.Calls for a boycott failed to catch on, and the event went on to garner high ratings, with one BBC poll even declaring it the best World Cup of the century.Greed and corruption are obvious explanations for how this was allowed to happen. There is substantial evidence of corruption within both FIFA and Qatar, particularly regarding the bidding process for the games.Reports also indicate that some fans were paid by the host to sing and chant on command, and celebrities were paid huge amounts to attend and endorse the event, thereby whitewashing Qatar’s human rights record.Such blatant displays of greed are not always met with apathy. In 2021, for example, the attempt to form the European Super League faced widespread, vehement criticism from fans, football players, managers, and politicians, and the multi-million dollar venture was swiftly axed as a result.The unique, irrational appealObjectively speaking, Qatar’s human rights abuses are unforgivable. However, humanity’s fascination with sport is emotional rather than rational, meaning it is extremely difficult to analyse or explain from an objective point of view.It is therefore worth considering how organisers addressed human rights concerns in the run up to the 2022 World Cup. Shortly before the its opening, FIFA President Gianni Infantino and Secretary General Fatma Samoura wrote the following in a letter to competing teams: “Please, let’s now focus on the football! We know football does not live in a vacuum and we are equally aware that there are many challenges and difficulties of a political nature all around the world. But please do not allow football to be dragged into every ideological or political battle that exists.”Such a statement may seem cynical and calculated, but it reflects a widespread perception that modern sports are pure, universal and autotelic—meaning an activity in and of itself, rather than a means to an end. This is often expressed in claims like “sport is art”, or that sports should be separate from politics.Sport’s appeal for both participants and spectators therefore lies in its immediacy, and its ability to unify people into an authentic experience of the here and now. The men and women on the field are much more than sweaty people wearing shorts and kicking a ball—to spectators they are heroes of pure beauty.This might help us understand the strikingly and paradoxically different responses to the 2022 World Cup and the Super League. The Super League aimed to usurp the traditional structure of football to benefit big clubs over small ones, but it was perceived as a greedy affront to the purity of sport. However, fans may have been able to accept the death toll of the Qatar World Cup as a necessary sacrifice to preserve the universal, binding power of modern sport.The 1936 ‘Nazi Olympics’The pivotal moment in shaping our modern sporting ethos was the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, also known as the Nazi Olympics. The controversial event ignited a widespread boycott movement, which argued that holding and respecting the games under a fascist and antisemitic regime would tarnish sport’s purity, and vindicate the Third Reich in front of a global audience.Nevertheless, the games went ahead, giving a powerful demonstration of sport’s ability to make the world overlook unspeakable crimes. Oppressive nations today are still following its example.Ethical sporting cultureNearly a hundred years later, Qatar is a candidate to host the 2036 Olympics. Given the death toll of the 2022 World Cup, it is likely that such an event will cost the lives of thousands more workers, and it should be met with firm resistance.However, history teaches us that protests should not be based solely on general terms like “sportswashing” or cynical perspectives that overlook the emotional and tangible meaning that sport holds in people’s lives.As seen in the case of the Super League, sports fans are capable of fighting for the purity of the games they love, but such a fight for the soul of modern sports should not begin only after enjoying the summer tournaments. Ultimately, as sports fans, we should know that ethics often begin in the here and now.-The Conversation \nA year and a half after the election of the House of Representatives, the thematic committees in the federal parliament still seem to be struggling to gain momentum in their works. In this tenure of the legislature, the committees have been unable to make any impact with regard to holding the executive accountable in governance and service delivery. As House committees work in a dedicated way on certain issues, the thematic panels are considered the parliament’s workshops. But the legislative units have thus far failed to create much enthusiasm.It took the House of Representatives over one and half months to sit for the first meeting after it was elected on November 20, 2022. The lower House formed 10 thematic committees on April 28, 2023—over three and half months after the first House meeting was convened on January 9. But the committees got their chairs only at the August-end. Until then, the panels were run on an ad-hoc basis and chaired by the oldest members of the respective committees. All in all, it took nine months for the mini-parliaments to get their full shape and function in a full-fledged manner.Besides the permanent committees, the parliament forms special panels for specific purposes. For instance, the lower house formed a special committee to probe embezzlements of hundreds of billions of rupees by cooperatives. The committee’s formation helped end the weeks-long parliament obstruction by the main opposition Nepali Congress, which was demanding a panel to investigate irregularities in the cooperatives. As the special committee led by lawmaker Surya Thapa of ruling party CPN-UML begins its work, officials at the parliament secretariat have said they lack even basic resources to carry out the panel’s work. Officials said that in order to analyse financial transactions of the cooperatives, they needed support of an expert team. But, according to them, the parliament secretariat lacks a budget to hire independent experts. Though they plan to seek the central bank’s help, it’s dangerous to make the parliament so weak that it cannot even carry out its routine tasks. The panel’s plan of seeking experts’ help to analyse the transactions in a professional way sounds rational as a decision based solely on the inquiry of lawmakers in the committee, none of whom have expert accounting knowledge, might later be questioned.Only a few weeks ago the State Affairs Committee was criticised for offering NGO-sponsored meals to its members and other participants at one of its meetings. The meeting had to be abandoned midway for the same reason. Our lawmakers are often criticised for going on field studies and on-site inspections on the funding of questionable organisations. Similarly, our parliament was in the past pilloried for involving international agencies in crucial tasks such as lawmaking and other affairs where outside involvement created direct conflict of interest. It has thus become imperative for the executive to allocate sufficient budget for the legislature in order to ward off undue influence, conflict of interest and make the legislature capable of doing its basic job.  \nThe weather across the country will be generally to mostly cloudy on Wednesday.Thunder and lightning are expected in multiple locations, along with mild to moderate rain. The meteorological forecasting division has warned of heavy rainfall in several places within Koshi Bagmati, Gandaki, Lumbini, and Sudur Pashchim provinces. Additionally, a few places in Karnali Province may experience heavy rainfall. Issuing a special bulletin, the Met Office has advised residents to be prepared for varying intensities of rainfall throughout the day, with chances of very heavy rainfall at one or two places in Bagmati Province, Gandaki Province, Lumbini Province, and Sudur Pashchim Province.Meanwhile, the weather will remain generally to mostly cloudy tonight. Light to moderate rain, accompanied by thunder and lightning, is forecast in a few areas. Heavy rainfall is expected in parts of Bagmati Province, Gandaki Province, and Sudur Pashchim Province. There is also a possibility of very heavy rainfall at isolated places in Bagmati Province and Gandaki Province. The maximum temperature on Tuesday was recorded at 34.6 degrees Celsius at Dipayal, while Jomsom’s lowest recorded temperature was 16.0 degrees Celsius. \nAt least 116 people, many of them women and children, were killed in a stampede at a Hindu religious gathering in northern India on Tuesday, authorities said, in one of the country's worst such tragedies in years.The stampede happened in a village in Hathras district in Utter Pradesh, about 200 km (125 miles) southeast of the national capital New Delhi, where authorities said thousands had gathered in sweltering late afternoon temperatures.The stampede occurred when a crowd of devotees started pushing towards the stage after the event to touch the preacher, who was coming down, said Yogi Adityanath, chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous state.While the cause was not immediately clear, Hathras district administrator Ashish Kumar suggested it may have been “due to overcrowding at the time when people were trying to leave the venue”.Another senior state official, Chaitra V., told broadcaster India Today that people may have lost their footing as they sought water in the heat.“There was wet mud at one place where people may have slipped. Also because of the heat, people may have made their way to the spot where water was kept and that could have caused the incident as well,” she said, adding that 18 were injured and in hospital.Police said they had launched an investigation and promised action against anyone found to be responsible, adding that the gathering may have been larger than had been permitted.“Lapses by authorities will also be investigated and action will be taken on the basis of the report which will be available within 24 hours,” state police chief Prashant Kumar said.Video clips recorded by news agency ANI, in which Reuters has a minority stake, showed bodies piled into the back of trucks and laid out in vehicles.Purses and bags covered in dust, were heaped up at the venue, with people sitting on their haunches sifting through them to identify their belongings.Mobile phones were similarly piled together, waiting to be claimed by their owners.A video on social media showed a large crowd packed into a tented area, standing and listening to devotional tunes as they waved their hands in the direction of the religious leader who sat on a stage.It also showed some women hanging on to the bamboo poles holding up the canopy to get a better view above the heads of the large crowd.Reuters could not immediately verify the social media images.“There must have been about 50,000 people...at the gate on the highway, some people were going left and some people were going right, the stampede was caused in that confusion,” Suresh Chandra, a witness who was at the gathering, told local media.Seema, a woman who travelled from a town almost 60 km away to attend the event, said she was leaving the venue when the stampede occurred. She was accompanied by three relatives, two of whom were killed.Stampedes and other accidents involving large crowds at religious gatherings and pilgrimage sites have happened in the past and are often blamed on poor crowd management.A stampede in central India in 2013 killed 115 people, while nearly 250 died in 2008 and more than 340 were killed during an annual pilgrimage in the western state of Maharashtra in 2005, according to local media reports.Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the federal government was assisting the state and announced a compensation of 200,000 rupees ($2,400) to the families of the dead and 50,000 rupees to those injured. \nThe 15th municipal meeting of Bharatpur Metropolitan City recently endorsed its policy and programme that aims to make the metropolis clean, green, safe and prosperous. Just after a week of the municipal meeting, the streets of Bharatpur are littered with heaps of garbage, posing health risks during the monsoon.Waste management has become a major problem in Bharatpur, especially for people living near the banks of the Narayani river, as the riverside serves as the only landfill site for the city of around 370,000 people. And the problem worsens every monsoon as the metropolis disposes of its waste on the banks of the river, which is just 400 metres from Nagarban settlement, making life difficult for all local residents.According to the data of the environment section of Bharatpur Metropolitan City Office, around 70 to 80 tonnes of garbage are being collected in the metropolis daily. Garbage, both renewable and non-renewable, is being deposited on the banks of the Narayani river as the metropolis does not have a well-managed landfill site.The metropolitan city, somehow, manages the solid waste during the dry season. But both the rain-swollen river and locals obstruct the municipal authority in managing garbage during the monsoon season. The garbage trucks cannot reach the designated place as the river banks get flooded in the rainy season. As a result, the sanitation workers are compelled to dump the garbage near human settlements that trigger stringent protests from the locals.“It has been more than 20 years since the metropolis dumped garbage on the riverbank in our ward,” said Bikash Thapa, chairman of ward 3 of Bharatpur metropolis. “During the dry season, the metropolis dumps the garbage a little further from the settlement, but during the monsoon, it dumps and buries the garbage near the settlement. There is no more space left in the area for dumping and burying garbage.”The locals of ward 3 have been obstructing the metropolis from dumping garbage on the riverbank. Garbage has been piled up in the streets since Thursday due to the protest of the local people.Bharatpur metropolis is now looking for an alternative place to dump the garbage after the locals’ disruption in ward 3. “Search is on to find a suitable place in ward 1 to manage the garbage,” said Suraj Paudel, chief at the sanitation management unit of Bharatpur Metropolitan City. According to him, the metropolis and two private companies have been collecting and managing the solid waste currently.The metropolis has been dumping its garbage on the banks of Narayani river for the past 15 years after the then Hetauda Appellate Court issued an order banning the disposal of waste at Jaldevi Community Forest, stating its biological importance. Since then, Bharatpur has been dumping its waste on the Narayani riverbanks, which is just 200-300 metres away from the city area.The federal government in the fiscal year 2011-12 had allotted 15 bigha of land in the Jaldevi Community Forest to the metropolitan city to build a well-managed landfill site. As compensation for the use of the forestland, the metropolis some five years ago had purchased another 15 bighas (10 hectares) of land in Madi to be used for reforestation. But the Division Forest Office in Bharatpur in 2023 refused to swap forest land with the land that the metropolis purchased in Madi as that land does not adjoin the national forest. As a result, the metropolitan city’s plan to construct a landfill site remains in limbo.“We have been seriously working on garbage management,” said Mayor Renu Dahal in a press meet organised to conclude the municipal meeting last week. “We are yet to get results despite working sincerely for the construction of a well managed landfill site.” The metropolis allocates a Rs50 million budget to manage garbage for the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25.Bharatpur, one of the country’s six metropolitan cities, is still struggling to find a location for the landfill site. In 2018, the metropolitan office signed an agreement with the Sudokwon Landfill Site Management Corporation of South Korea to come up with a master plan for a proper waste management system. The masterplan was to be prepared within 15 months from the date of the agreement.“The agreement was signed for the proper waste management of the city. We thought that the Korean company would come with the master plan,” said Dahal, assuring that an alternative landfill site will be sought soon to initiate construction work. “But the company did not work citing the Covid-19 pandemic. The metropolis is now working itself for the sustainable management of solid waste.” \nA stampede at a Hindu religious gathering in Uttar Pradesh, India, has claimed the lives of at least 87 people, with the death toll expected to rise.\nCPN-UML urges PM Dahal to resign for a new government formation with KP Sharma Oli as leader and Dahal resisting the request with plans for a trust vote.\nPresident Ramchandra Paudel appointed Suresh Adhikari from Sankhuwasabha as the Secretary of the House of Representatives on the recommendation of Speaker Devraj Ghimire.\nAstrological predictions for different zodiac signs, emphasizing the impact of emotions, relationships, and self-care, with warnings about potential conflicts and a need for self-awareness.\nPolitical interference has led to frequent and controversial ambassadorial appointments in Nepal, with half being political appointees and the other half chosen from career diplomats.\nOn March 15 last year, China reopened its borders for travel, ending a three-year closure during the Covid pandemic. As soon as the borders—land and air—opened, and the China-funded international airport in Pokhara was inaugurated, optimism was high. Before the pandemic, market insiders predicted a dramatic surge in Chinese tourists, who were Nepal’s second-largest source market after India before the Covid-19 pandemic. It didn’t happen. Nepal received 60,878 Chinese tourists in 2023, a recovery by a third from the pre-pandemic level when Chinese tourists boomed in Nepal.In the first five months (January–May) of this year, Nepal received 46,671 Chinese, with the highest arrival of 12,093 recorded in March. While Chinese arrivals slowed, Indian tourists boomed in Nepal, reaching an all-time high of 319,936 individuals, according to the Department of Immigration. Among Indians, only those who come by air are counted as tourists in Nepal. In the first five months, Nepal has received 148,861 Indian tourists, the highest number of 38,288 recorded in May. Before the pandemic, India and China were competing neck-to-neck. Now, there is a huge imbalance between the south and north.Will it change? On Monday, during the 16th round of the Nepal-China diplomatic consultation mechanism meeting held in Kathmandu, Beijing made a surprise announcement.It announced plans to promote Nepali tourism in China as part of celebrating 2025 as ‘Visit Nepal Year in China’, which Nepal’s top travel trade entrepreneurs say is a “big statement.” They say they had never before heard China favour any country with such soft power diplomacy.Will 2025 be the year for the potential great return of Chinese tourists then? “So far, I haven’t heard or seen Beijing promote any country’s tourism inside China. This is, in fact, a good gesture of neighbourliness,” said Kishore Raj Pandey, chairman of Saathi Nepal Travel and Tours, who was the first person to bring Chinese tourists to Nepal in 2001.“If it has been announced, Beijing indeed has some policy to encourage Chinese citizens to travel to Nepal.”Tourism is vital for Nepal’s economy. According to the recently released annual World Travel and Tourism Council research report, Nepal’s tourism sector generated Rs327.9 billion ($2.5 billion) in revenue and supported 1.19 million jobs directly and indirectly last year. The report forecasts that Nepal will generate 1.22 million jobs in 2024. Last year, the country received 1 million tourists.Some critics say it’s a lofty promise. Before Monday’s meeting, during the third Nepal Investment Summit held in Kathmandu on April 28, Luo Zhaohui, chairman of the China International Development Cooperation Agency, announced the waiver of visa fees for Nepalis.It was implemented on May 1. There was another announcement, too.“The Chinese government is making arrangements to start new flights from China to Nepal’s two new international airports—Pokhara and Lumbini,” Luo said while addressing the summit.Nepal’s $216 million international airport in Pokhara, the country’s tourism capital, opened in January last year. Beijing financed it.Similarly, Nepal’s second international airport in Bhairahawa, built by Chinese contractors, started operating in May 2022 after four years of construction delays. The objectives of both projects are to decentralise economic activities in the new federal setup, attract more tourists, and prevent Nepalis from going abroad.But only some international flights are operating in the two new shiny airports.“Under Beijing's renewed diplomacy, there is a possibility of the operation of these two new international airports,” said Basant Raj Mishra, a senior tourism entrepreneur. “Once flights from China come, it will create competition.”He said Beijing’s announcement represents a great opportunity for Nepal. “We should be prepared for joint marketing and promotional activities. With a proper policy, we can attract 1 million tourists from China alone in 2025. And for this, we need enhanced flight connectivity.”China is facing many economic obstacles, but Beijing remains optimistic about growth.Reports show that Chinese tourists hit the road in significant numbers during the recent five-day Labor holidays in May but kept a tight grip on their wallets, reflecting still-weak sentiment in the world’s second-largest economy.According to a statement from China’s Ministry of Culture and Tourism, travellers made 28.2 percent more trips, but spending only rose 13.5 percent from the 2019 break. “Of all the countries, China has the largest number of airlines connecting Nepal but brings the lowest number of tourists,” said Vijay Shrestha, vice president (Administration) at Himalaya Airlines, the Nepal-Tibet joint venture. There are five airlines currently connecting China. “The traffic is low,” said Shrestha. “It may be due to low consumer confidence.”Himalaya Airlines has suspended Kathmandu-Beijing flights, and Kathmandu-Shanghai flights are also irregular due to low passenger traffic. Besides, in the other three sectors, the average occupancy is 40 percent,” said Shrestha. “The announcement from Beijing to promote Nepal in China could change that.”Nepal and China established formal diplomatic relations in 1955, and Nepal-Tibet trade goes a long way back. In 1956, four cities of Tibet, namely Lhasa, Shigatse, Gyantse, and Yatung, were designated as major trading cities for Nepali traders.Between the founding of the People’s Republic of China in 1949 and 1982, few residents of China travelled to foreign destinations other than government officials, students, and a few businessmen. In 1983, China allowed citizens from Guangdong Province to travel to the British colony of Hong Kong on organised tours to visit family.Beginning in 1995, the Chinese National Tourism Administration formalised China’s Approved Destination Status (ADS) policy.The history of Chinese tourism in Nepal is not long either. Nepal first participated in the China International Travel Fair in 2000 to promote its tourism sector. Before 2000, the Chinese could only travel to Nepal on official visits.The Chinese government had permitted ADS for Chinese outbound travellers in November 2001. The two countries signed an initial memorandum of understanding on an implementation plan for outbound travel by Chinese people to Nepal on April 16, 2001, laying the groundwork for the ADS.Nepal was given the Approved Destination Status (ADS) by its northern neighbour in 2002, and in June of the same year, Chinese citizens began visiting Nepal officially for the first time as tourists. Nepal was the 18th nation to receive the status and first in South Asia. In 2002, Nepal got 8,715 Chinese tourists.Subsequently, the central banks of the two countries signed an agreement on bilateral cooperation that allowed the Chinese currency to be converted into Nepali rupees in a bid to boost bilateral trade, tourism, and economic cooperation.However, immediately after Nepal received the ADS, arrivals from China fell due to a violent conflict that intensified over 2002-2004, reaching Nepal’s main cities and tourist destinations. Nepal eventually started witnessing a constant growth in Chinese arrivals after June 2009.Chinese arrivals to Nepal crossed the 100,000 mark for the first time in 2013, mainly due to the improved air links between the two countries. According to the tourism ministry’s statistics, around 93 percent of Chinese tourists were first-time visitors to Nepal.In 2014, Nepal received 123,805 Chinese visitors.The 2015 earthquake and India's blockade led to arrivals from China dropping to a four-year low of 64,675 individuals in 2015, down 47.76 percent from 2014.The surface road at the Tatopani border point, where Nepal used to receive many Chinese tourists, was also blocked.On December 25, 2015, Nepal announced ‘free visa’ for Chinese tourists, giving them the same treatment accorded to South Asian visitors. In a bid to revive flagging arrivals, the scheme was implemented in January 2016.Thereon, tourist arrivals from China started rising steadily, and Nepal saw the strongest growth, 46.8 percent, in tourist arrivals from China, with the overall number reaching 153,633 visitors in 2018.In 2019, Nepal received a record 169,543 Chinese tourists.The number fell to 19,257 in 2020. In 2021 and 2022, there were 6,198 and 9,599 Chinese tourists in Nepal—mainly diplomats and those stranded in third countries—who came to Nepal when Beijing enforced never-ending lockdowns.When the Chinese economy started to boom again, Nepali investors pumped money into luxury hotels, which too have multiplied. \nLast month, a local from Sindhupalchowk district was brought to Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital to treat a snakebite. Along with the victim, relatives brought the live snake in a bottle to show the doctor as proof.“The snake was a king cobra,” said Dr Yuba Nidhi Basaula, director at the Hospital. “Fortunately, the venom had not penetrated deep into the victim’s body, and after three days of treatment, the victim was discharged. We called a snake handler and handed over the king cobra.”Sindhupalchowk is a mountain district where venomous snakes were thought of as non-existent. However, incidents of king cobra bites in mountain districts like Sindhupalchowk suggest that venomous snakes have started migrating towards hill and mountain districts, and rising temperatures caused by climate change are the main culprit, experts say.Nepal is among the world’s most vulnerable countries to the climate crisis and has witnessed multiple extreme weather events over the past decade and a half.Evidence suggests that maximum temperatures in Nepal are rising at a faster rate of 0.056 degrees Celsius a year, compared to the global average rise of 0.03 degrees Celsius a year. Compared to districts of the Tarai region, those in hills and mountains have been witnessing a more rapid increase in daytime maximum temperatures, which could have helped venomous snakes survive there, experts say.“Not only in Sindhupalchowk, but a king cobra bite was also spotted in Godawari of Lalitpur district last year,” said Basaula. “Snakebite cases have started rising alarmingly of late.”Of the 31 patients admitted to the hospital on Sunday, 16—more than 50 percent—were snakebite cases. Doctors at the hospital say eight to ten snakebite victims seek treatment there every day, and most victims seeking care at the hospital are from the districts of Kathmandu Valley or from those adjoining the Valley.Each year, around 2,700 people, mostly children and women from Nepal’s Tarai region, die of snakebites, according to a March 2022 report published in The Lancet, a leading international medical journal.However, snakebite cases are vastly underreported in the country. The Ministry of Health and Population said that only 14 deaths and 1,220 cases of snakebites had been reported in 11 months of the current fiscal year. Officials admit that venomous snakebite incidents are being reported from hill and mountain districts, and the demand for anti-snake venom is on the rise. They attribute this rise in snakebite incidents to rising temperatures. “Health facilities in some mountainous and hilly districts—like Darchula and Bajura—have asked for anti-snake venom,” said Dr Hemanta Chandra Ojha, an official at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Snakebite incidents have been on the rise,” said Dr Hemanta Chandra Ojha, an official at the division. “With the onset of the monsoon, people living in the risk areas should remain vigilant.”Every year, the Health Ministry purchases around 25,000 vials of anti-snake venom and distributes them to around 100 snakebite treatment centres in the country.Officials say as snakebite cases surge, so will the demand for additional treatment centres. “This year, we are planning to set up an additional 15 snakebite treatment centres,” said Ojha. Public health experts have urged authorities to launch an awareness drive about the risks. They say people living in thatched-roof houses are particularly vulnerable to snakebites, as snakes often enter such homes in search of rats. They say people should be asked to keep their homes and surroundings clean, prevent children from playing in bushy areas, avoid venturing out at night, and use torchlights while walking in the dark.Likewise, women and children who have to work in fields and go to the jungle are at the highest risk of snakebites. Small children are at risk of dying from snakebites, as they do not tell their parents about the bites on time due to fear of getting scolded for playing in the bushes, according to doctors.“We should make people aware so that they seek medical attention immediately after a snakebite, using whatever means of transport they get,” said Ojha. “The faster you reach the hospital, the greater your chances of survival.” \nThe duel between Kathmandu’s 34-year-old mayor Balendra Shaha (popularly called Balen), a structural engineer, reputed rapper and political novice, and 72-year-old Khagda Prasad Sharma Oli, a high school dropout, two-time prime minister, political veteran and chairperson of the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist) is a caricature of contemporary Nepali politics marred by the conflict between the old and the young. The duel has attracted numerous newspaper articles, set social media on fire and provided YouTubers a field day. What is Oli’s motive in mobilising his whole party to attack Balen, and what is Balen—a lone man with no political experience and political following—doing picking a fight with Oli? How will the duel impact Oli’s party and Balen’s aspirations going forward? The fightThe Balen-Oli fight began when the metropolitan city started to clear buildings built illegally on municipal land or business advertisements that did not comply with municipal regulations. The city would order the current occupants of the offending buildings or business owners to comply with the law and vacate the premises. In most cases, the occupants would ignore the order. Like in old times, they relied on their political connections to continue to subvert the law. However, that did not work with Balen. He sent municipal forces to demolish the encroachment and non-compliant adverts. The first property subjected to the mayor's action belonged to someone connected to the UML. Soon after the clearance, a Central Committee member of the UML, Mahesh Basnet, called upon his minions to physically harm Balen if he did not “mend his ways”.Balen’s attempt to clean up Kathmandu from squatters occupying public land, particularly river banks, intensified the conflict. Oli publicly mocked Balen for using bulldozers to demolish plastic shades built by “poor squatters.” Some “squatters” are believed to occupy multistory buildings constructed on public land and own businesses worth millions of rupees. The majority of them are UML voters, “UMLs’ vote bank”, observed a Balen supporter. The squatter problem is not new. All previous governments, including the one led by Oli, recognised it. The conflict became increasingly acrimonious when Balen opened the basement of Dharahara for car parking. The government objected, arguing that the reconstruction of Dharahara is still incomplete and the car park is unsafe to use. Balen retorted, “Dharahara was inaugurated as a completed project by Prime Minister Oli before the last election. How can it be incomplete?” The inauguration of the work-in-progress was one of Prime Minister Oli’s pre-election charades. The car park is safe and currently in use; the reconstruction continues. The recent New Road imbroglio added fuel to the fire. Balen started widening the footpath on New Road to comply with the standards set by the Nepal Department of Roads (NDR). A local ward chair, a UML member, objected and complained to the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport headed by Deputy Prime Minister Ragubhir Mahaseth, an Oli acolyte. The NDR, which reports to Mahaseth, issued a “stop work” order. Incensed, Balen asked Oli to expeditiously arrange repayment for those who cheated the so-called Giri Bandhu Tea Estate land plotting scandal. Oli’s apparatchiks compared Balen to “a puppy” (a good-for-nothing weakling) and chastised him for maligning “our respected Chairman”. Oli himself has described Balen as a “bubble” which will fizzle out in no time. The fightersOli is old, witty, foxy, prickly, intolerant of criticism and, like all other politicians, corrupt in the public eye. As enunciated during his premiership, his vision of economic development includes building view towers, providing Kathmandu households with piped gas within six months, and building facilities for maritime trade—the latter two unachievable pipe dreams or political ploys. Balen is young, angry, ambitious, audacious, brash, bold, impulsive, focussed and untainted by corruption. His vision for Kathmandu is to make it a clean, functioning, beautiful heritage city. In about two years since he became mayor, Kathmandu has become relatively cleaner and greener. Its roads are rid of perpetual potholes; its sidewalks are walkable; teaching standards in public schools have improved; private schools who were short-changing on paying taxes have been forced to pay their share; emergency ambulance service has become more dependable, and so on. All of the above, despite a lack of support from political parties and the government. Parties do not support him because his success will spotlight their past failures. Despite the odds, his accomplishments have made him hugely popular throughout the country. “If we have ten leaders like Balen, we can change the country,” an exuberant Kathmandu taxi driver told me. Even the international press has taken note of Balen’s leadership. The New York Times published a story on Balen last year. He was named one of the 100 upcoming leaders in 2023 by the internationally known Time Magazine, published in the US. Balen’s public support is so visceral that he gets away even with outrageous comments like “burning Singha Durbar’, Nepal’s central secretariat, the office of Nepal’s Ministries, and irrelevant dragging of Oli into the “Giri Bandhu Tea Estate” scandal, and other similar outbursts. Although the overwhelming support for such comments on social media is surprising, it is indicative of the intensity of public dislike of established politicians.The future Balen knows that he owes his popularity as much to his performance as his refusal to bow down to political pressure and to stay clean from corruption scandals. In the two years since he assumed office, he has given confidence to the city dwellers that with exemplary leadership, the city and the country can be changed. His future depends on whether he can continue to ignore political pressure and demonstrate his perseverance, will, guts and vision to turn chaotic Kathmandu into a livable metropolis. As for Oli, UML lost the last election in Kathmandu because its mayor, a UML member, was a dismal failure. The confrontation with Balen for political upmanship and ego inflation will unlikely win Kathmandu for him. Cooperation may work better than confrontation.    \nThe Rastriya Swatantra Party's General Secretary emphasizes collaboration with independent forces like Balen Shah and Gopi Hamal instead of established politicians due to differences in working styles and public dissatisfaction.\nMain events succinctly summarized, retaining key details.\nKey events unfold, shaping the course of events and impacting the lives of those involved.\nSri Lanka, despite financial struggles, showcases its diverse attractions, including ancient irrigation systems, and is experiencing a tourism resurgence.\nEducation in Every Home’s report titled ‘Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in Nepal’s Textbooks’ highlights the lack of diversity, inclusivity, and inaccuracies in these textbooks.  The findings include egregious mistakes in textbooks like the inclusion of a letter Abraham Lincloln supposedly wrote—dating to a time 17 years after his assassination, to assertions like Brazil has tigers, elephants and rhinos while Germany has tigers and monkeys. The books display a clear bias in favour of Brahmin Chhetri males, while women make up just 18 percent of all people profiled. While 80 percent of all bylines are male, the presence of marginalised communities, especially Dalits, is nearly non-existent.  \nIs the portrayal of a woman in a position of power inherently feminist? This question struck me when I visited the Siddhartha Art Gallery's latest exhibition featuring Kalighat paintings. I found myself amused and conflicted by one piece, ‘Babu and Bibi II,’ in which a bourgeois woman holds a leash attached to a dog with a man's head. In today's art world, feminism has become a buzzword—from discussions in my homeland of Cyprus to my university classrooms in the US and now here in Kathmandu. Yet, beyond the surface-level rhetoric of ‘feminism’ and ‘equality’, deeper conversations often reveal these concepts' ambiguity and diverse interpretations. Feminism means something different to everyone, even within the same progressive circles.Siddhartha Art Gallery’s exhibition places three story-telling art forms in conversation with one another: Patachitra, Bilampau, and Kalighat paintings. Patachitra is the original art form from which folk artists deviated to invent the Bilampau and Kalighat styles. This is one of the most unique aspects of the exhibition; by placing all three styles alongside one another, visitors can see the evolution of folk art as it travelled across South Asia. Bilampau paintings result from the Patachitra tradition of crossing from India into Nepal, and Kalighat is the product of the migration of Patachitra artists to Kolkata. All three art styles share certain narrative and symbolic attributes. When stepping into the gallery, the Kalighat paintings stand out the most as they differ quite from Patachitra and Bilampau in style and subject matter. Unlike the other two painting styles, these paintings depict a scene with only one or two characters and have no background details. Nepali Bilampau narrative scrolls differ from Patachitra in that they tell a story from left to right rather than vertically. Apart from the direction of the narrative, Bilampau and Patachitra paintings are largely similar in featured stories and style. Before stepping into the exhibition, I hadn’t encountered Kalighat paintings, but their depiction of women immediately captured my attention. These small-scale artworks defy conventional gender roles, blending humour with a sharp critique of their time's moral and social norms. What drew my interest was that the artists' intentions are almost completely left to the imagination.Diving into the context of Kalighat paintings sheds some light on their potentially intended messages and whether they can be dubbed as ‘feminist’ or not. These paintings trace directly back to the goddess Kali, often called the ‘mother Goddess’.Kali destroys evil to protect the innocent and is associated with power, change, deviance, and time—all traits that result in her depictions being strongly connected to feminism.The Kalighat art style was born around a temple dedicated to the Goddess Kali, the Kalighat temple, in 19th-century Kolkata (then Calcutta). Folk ‘patua’ artists migrated to the city, near the Kalighat temple, as it became a trade centre in colonial India.These artists were trained in Patachitra narrative scroll paintings, which were several feet long and contained some narrative scenes.Once the folk ‘patua’ artists moved to Kolkata, many saw an opportunity in the popularity of the Kalighat temple.Shifting away from their narrative scrolls, they began to use their artistic skills to produce portable depictions of the Goddess Kali and other deities for people to take home as religious souvenirs. It didn’t take long for these ‘Kalighat paintings’ to grow in popularity, and the art style emerged as a distinct art genre.These initial versions of Kalighat paintings can also be seen in the Siddhartha Art Gallery’s new exhibition, such as a beautiful piece depicting Krishna playing the flute for Radha and a piece named ‘Kalighat Kali’.The second phase of these paintings is where the scenes become more interesting and potentially controversial. In the mid-1900s, Kalighat artists moved away from solely religious characters and began using their paintings as an active means of subversion.Their paintings focused on the pretensions of the ‘Babu culture’—the Westernised, upper-class Bengali men who adopted European mannerisms and fashions.The influence of British colonialism on gender roles and Babus and Bibis in Bengal cannot be understated.As Western ideas and practices permeated Bengali society, traditional gender roles were challenged and reinterpreted. Kalighat artists navigated these shifts with astute observation and artistic flair, capturing the tension between tradition and Western modernity concepts.The Babus and Bibis featured in each painting are distinctive in their dress and jewellery, which are always lavish and influenced by European culture. What may be first noticed in Siddhartha’s current collection is that Babus also nearly always have a long, thin moustache, while Bibis are voluptuous and wear relatively revealing clothing.These caricatures entertained the public and served as cautionary tales, warning against the pitfalls of excess and moral decay caused by opulence.British colonial officers were also sometimes depicted in humorous anti-colonial scenes. Kalighat artists became widely known for their keen sense of humour and a sharp eye for social satire.Multiple artists or whole families often made these artworks, each member performing a specific task such as paper preparation, outlining, or shading. Most importantly, the artists never signed their works or gave their works titles, meaning that the exact origins and intended meanings of the depicted scenes are not specified for the viewers.In other words, each work that a visitor sees in the gallery’s exhibition, or any other collection, has been given a title by the curator rather than the artists behind the work.Therefore, even though the chosen expressions and positioning in each painting always tell a story, the artist's intended message is left up to interpretation, which can be wildly misleading in many cases.In some Kalighat artworks featured in the exhibition, we can see where the artist’s intended meaning and the later given title potentially drastically conflict. For example, a painting labelled ‘Bibi with her pets’ features Bibi sitting on a chair with a snake, tiger and bull at her feet.Since the bull and tiger are depicted drinking from the same dish, this scene could be referencing a Bengali saying, “baghe-gorute ek ghate jol khaowa,” which roughly translates to “a person/force so powerful, they can make a tiger and a cow drink water from the same source.”This image of a woman overlooking a cow and a tiger drinking together peacefully directly suggests that the woman is incredibly powerful and is possibly a loose reference to the Goddess Kali. Contradictorily, the painting’s later-assigned title subtly demeans the seated woman.By dubbing these animals as ‘pets’, the perception of the painting is transformed, and her position in the chair becomes one of leisure, aimlessness, and materialism.Another key example of the range of meaning that could be taken away from these paintings is ‘Babu and Bibi IV’. In this work, Babu is seen kneeling at Bibi’s feet while Bibi looks down on Babu, holds her hair and steps on his clothing.On the one hand, this scene could be interpreted as the normalisation of women being in positions of power in a relationship, conversely suggesting that men do not need to subscribe to hyper-masculine ideals.On the other hand, the scene could be mocking men who do not follow the patriarchy and demeaning them for allowing their wives to subordinate them. Depending on which interpretation you choose to take from each work featured in the exhibition or what title it is given, Kalighat paintings can result in contradictory narratives about feminism.‘Babu and Bibi IV’ is one of many paintings in the exhibition where women are depicted with agency and independence, challenging traditional patriarchal norms in both Indian and colonial societies.This subversion of gender norms within the paintings can be seen as a form of resistance against the influence of European culture on Bengali society. At the same time, considering that this art style originated from depictions of the Goddess Kali, one can see how the artists’ intentions may have been leaning towards women's empowerment rather than the satirising of men who did not follow masculine ideals.Despite the seemingly open-ended intentions of the Kalighat artists, they certainly used Kalighat paintings to produce visual commentaries on the evolving social landscape shaped by colonial pressures and indigenous responses.The exhibition offers an unmissable visual exploration of the evolution of the patachitra tradition in Bengali society. Through these artworks, viewers are given a glimpse into a time of cultural flux and social upheaval, where artists boldly challenge prevailing norms and ideologies through their works.As the world continues to evolve, Kalighat paintings resonate as a testament to the enduring power of art to provoke, inspire, and expose the human experience. \nThe parliamentary special committee investigating the embezzlement of depositors’ funds by various cooperatives on Tuesday decided to correspond with political parties with national status, seeking their suggestions on how to resolve the cooperative crisis.The panel made the decision after discussing issues related to the cooperative sector with officials from the National Cooperative Federation, the Savings and Credit Central Cooperative Association and the National Cooperative Bank Limited.Surya Thapa, the coordinator of the committee, said the meeting decided to correspond with political parties with national status in the House of Representatives, requesting written suggestions for resolving issues related to the misappropriation of funds and the return of savings to depositors.The meeting of the committee on Sunday decided to ask for documents from 20 cooperatives that were declared problematic by the government.Earlier, the committee, at its meeting on June 26, had decided to seek documents from cooperatives that transferred funds to Gorkha Media Network.Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai, the chairman of the media house, is accused of embezzling hundreds of millions of rupees in collusion with different cooperatives in Kaski, Chitwan, and Butwal. Rai is currently on the run.After weeks of negotiations between the ruling and opposition parties, a seven-member committee led by CPN-UML lawmaker Thapa was constituted on May 28 to investigate the embezzlement of deposits in dozens of cooperatives around the country.As per the committee’s jurisdiction as defined in its terms of reference, the committee will investigate the crisis-ridden cooperatives, their legal and institutional purposes, financial systems, regulatory arrangements, supervision and transparency, and make recommendations to the government.Another task is to recommend measures for the immediate return of savings to the depositors of the problematic cooperatives identified by the Department of Cooperatives and the Crisis-ridden Cooperatives Management Committee.The probe panel was formed after the main opposition Nepali Congress disrupted parliamentary proceedings for over two months demanding such a body be constituted to investigate cooperative scams.The issue got complicated as Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane, who is the chair of the Rastriya Swatantra Party, is also accused of misusing the money from various cooperatives. Lamichhane was managing director of Gorkha Media Network before joining politics. \nNepali Congress once again has reiterated that Nepal is not interested in loan funding of Belt and Road Initiatives (BRI) projects. Party spokesperson Parkash Saran Mahat said that after a meeting of the party's office bearers and former office bearers on Monday, the party concluded that Nepal should only accept grants, not loans for implementing BRI projects. “The debt burden is already high, so the party has decided that further debt should not be taken for implementing BRI projects,” he said. During the 16th round of the Nepal-China diplomatic consultation mechanism meeting, held on June 25 in Kathmandu, the two parties had planned to finalise the BRI implementation plan, but they could not agree on the modality for financing projects. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Nepal corresponded with the Prime Minister’s Office to seek approval for signing the implementation plan during the diplomatic consultation mechanism meeting attended by Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong, but it failed. The Congress, however, has been vocal in advocating for grants to implement BRI projects. During the Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi’s Nepal visit in March 2022, then Prime Minister Deuba had conveyed that Nepal would not implement BRI projects through loans. Congress leaders also said that President Sher Bahadur Deuba, during his meeting with CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli at the latter’s residence in Balkot on Saturday, discussed the funding modality of BRI. The Congress, which is the largest party in Parliament, held a gathering of its sitting and former office bearers on Monday following Saturday’s meeting between party chief Deuba and UML chair Oli. While the meeting between Deuba and Oli sparked speculations about the two parties potentially cooperating to form a government, the Congress leaders, after Monday’s meeting, dismissed such a possibility anytime soon. Congress spokesman Mahat categorically denied that the issue of Congress-UML collaboration on the government was discussed at Monday’s meeting. But he did not rule out the possibility of the two parties coming together in the future. Mahat outlined the conditions under which the two largest parties in the parliament could potentially collaborate: a stable and effective government, resolution of election-related challenges, and a clear path towards national stability and prosperity. “The Congress party believes that political issues should take precedence over the government’s role,” Mahat said. “On cooperation, our party is open to cooperating with all parties on pressing national issues.”He also said that the party is in discussion not just with the UML, but also with other parties for possible cooperation.However, a close ally of Deuba claimed that during the Saturday meeting, Deuba proposed Oli as the prime minister for the first round should the two parties cooperate to form a new government.  “As far as I know, Deuba is not in the mood to be prime minister at the moment,” the Congress leader who was present at the office bearer and former office bearer meeting on Monday told the Post. “In such circumstances, if two parties come together to form a government, Oli would lead it first.” A government of the two parties might be formed, but not in the next few days, said the Congress leader. Similarly, the Congress meeting on Monday also decided to extend the tenures of its sister organisation by six months. Their terms were expiring on July 4. “Today’s meeting decided to extend the terms of the sister organisations so that they can elect new office bearers within six months,” Jeevan Pariyar, the Deputy General Secretary of the party, told the Post. Meanwhile, Pariyar also said that the meeting decided to send the report of the party’s Mahasamiti meeting in February to the central committee for approval with amendments. During the Mahasamiti meeting, Vice-President Purna Bahadur Khadka had presented a policy document, General Secretary Gagan Thapa had proposed organisational reforms, General Secretary Bishwa Parkash Sharma had presented a document on contemporary political issues, and spokesperson Prakash Sharan Mahat a document on the economic situation, prospects and future direction. General Secretary Thapa's proposal drew controversy within the party. In it, he urged the party to contest the upcoming election on its own strength without forming any electoral alliance. Later, on March 4, the CPN (Maoist Centre) ditched its collaboration with the Congress and brought the UML into the government. The party pointed to Thapa’s proposal as a reason for a change in the ruling coalition.  \nCPN-UML leader K.P. Sharma Oli and Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba have agreed to form a new government with Oli as the prime minister for a year and a half, followed by Deuba, as part of a power-sharing arrangement that includes constitutional amendments and a review of the electoral system.\nKathmandu Metropolitan City intensifies dengue prevention efforts by destroying mosquito breeding grounds and raising awareness amidst rising cases in Nepal.\nKathmandu Metropolitan City provides mental health screening training to healthcare providers to enhance timely diagnosis and treatment for urban residents with mental health issues.\nKathmandu Mayor Balendra Shah and Deputy Mayor Sunita Dangol's harmonious relationship has been questioned after Dangol criticized Shah's behavior and remarks regarding road expansion plans, accusing him of undermining the institution's reputation and lacking respect for different perspectives.\nA police officer, Ajit Gole, was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound in the washroom of the federal parliament building in Kathmandu.\nPolice on Friday arrested two people from Thimi of Bhaktapur for allegedly mining cryptocurrency.The Central Investigation Bureau took 50-year-old Biswas Gurung and Rajendra Tahamata, 25, into custody in connection with the crime, said Hobindra Bogati, spokesperson for the bureau.The duo allegedly ran mining operations from the CTEVT’s information technology lab using a server and 64 desktops, on which blockchain applications were found during a preliminary investigation. Further investigation into the matter is underway. \nIn 2019-20, Nepal imported 236 units of passenger electric vehicles (EVs) from China worth some Rs674 million. In the past five years, imports of EVs from China jumped 35 times, suggesting EV adoption in Nepal is now outpacing that of conventional combustion vehicles which use engines that burn fossil fuels, such as petrol or diesel. The EVs have overtaken conventional combustion vehicles.The imports of fossil fuel-consuming passenger vehicles were 10,310 units worth Rs9.24 billion in 2019-20. After four years, in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, imports of conventional combustion vehicles were down to 3,537 units worth Rs4.21 billionHowever, overall vehicle imports have jumped from Rs65.02 billion in 2019-20 to Rs80 billion in the first 11 months of 2023-24.According to the Department of Customs, Nepal imported 11,466 units of EVs worth Rs29 billion in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, or by mid-June. The imports were 3,870 units worth Rs11.23 billion in the same period last fiscal year. Of the total EV imports, a third came from China. Customs data show that Nepal imported 7,931 units of EVs from China, accounting for 69 percent of the total EV imports in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year. This translates to Rs21 billion in value.After China, the majority of EVs were imported from India. In the review period, imports from India amounted to Rs6 billion, or 3,277 units. Until the last fiscal year, India was Nepal’s top EV supplier.The data show that Nepal imported 2,205 EVs worth Rs5.94 billion from India in the last fiscal year. In the same period, imports from China were 1,269 units worth Rs3.75 billion.Nepal’s imports of EVs jumped sharply by 158.23 percent in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year. Importers say BYD, a Chinese multinational, has taken over the Nepali market. The government collected revenue of Rs13.06 billion from the import of EVs in the review period.Akash Golchha, senior vice president of the Nepal Automobile Dealers Association, said the ongoing economic slowdown has not stopped Nepalis from buying EVs. However, petrol or diesel-run vehicle sales could have been better.EV sales and orders saw a dramatic surge before the budget was announced on May 28. Cimex Inc Pvt Ltd, the authorised distributor of BYD Auto Industry Co Ltd in Nepal, said it had achieved a milestone by delivering 50 cutting-edge BYD EVs in a single day on May 18. According to the company, all 50 units were sold from its service centre at Guheshwari, Kathmandu.According to Cimex, the company imported 4,000 EVs in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year. The import of Chinese EVs is high due to their larger production compared to India, said the company, which is among the top EV brands in Nepal.BYD’s Atto and Dolphin are the most preferred models among Nepali customers. With the recent hike in excise and customs duties, the company said the new price list of BYDs will be unveiled soon.“There was fear among buyers that the government may raise duty on EVs in the budget. As a result, the demand surged dramatically,” said Golchha. “The high import increased the stock of EVs.”Automobile dealers said that the government hiked the duty on EVs by 10 percent in the budget for the coming fiscal year 2024-25, which, however, may not impact the sales.Golchha said the government did not make drastic changes in the import duty of EVs in the budget, which may help EV sales boom in the coming days. “The EV demand will grow at a faster pace.”Auto dealers say the import boost for EVs is mainly due to banks’ easy financing. Banks lend up to 90 percent of the vehicle’s cost.Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun, in the annual budget for the upcoming fiscal year, revised the customs and excise duty rates on the import of EVs. The customs duty on EVs of up to 50 kW has been increased to 15 percent from 10 percent, while a 5 percent excise duty has been imposed on them.Likewise, the government increased the customs and excise duties on EVs of 50-100 kW by 5 percent. As per the revised tariffs, the customs duty has been increased to 20 percent from 15 percent, while the excise duty has been increased to 15 percent from 10 percent.The customs duty on 100-200 kW has been raised to 30 percent from 20 percent. Similarly, those in categories 200-300 kW and more than 300 KW will be subject to customs duty of 60 percent and 80 percent, respectively. In these vehicles, the indirect tax has been raised by 20 percent each.According to EV traders, the market is flooded with various EV models, features, and looks, and customers have options to select according to their needs. They said that EVs ranging from Rs4 million to Rs5.5 million have a large customer base, while high-priced EVs are also seeing good sales.EV traders said that despite the market slowdown, the EV sector has not been affected.“One interesting emerging trend is that people who already own conventional combustion vehicles are also buying EVs,” said Golchha. \nSeven Star International Travel and Tours has officially launched its website, www.esevenstar.com, an online travel platform featuring modern services for its customers. The website was launched on June 27, amidst a programme. The company said that the new modern travel platform has been launched using its decade-long experience in the field. Shiva Sharma Bastola, the company's managing director, said, “We have launched our very own OTA (Online Travel Agency). This is part of the company's effort to be linked to globalisation.” “With this launch, we now have access to the global market, and our goal is to reach customers all across the world.” The company said it would provide 24/7 services through the new platform. \nAs the monsoon gains traction, the price of vegetables has soared drastically in the Kathmandu valley, pushing up kitchen costs.Daily essentials like ginger, green chillies, tomatoes and potatoes are becoming prohibitively expensive for ordinary people.Traders say that production dropped due to low rainfall during the pre-monsoon (March-May) period. And with heavy rainfall in the last few weeks, floods and landslides have disrupted the supply chain. Before spring, the winter drought also reduced the output, vegetable traders say. Vegetable prices have gone up steadily in the past few months. According to the macroeconomic report of Nepal Rastra Bank, the country’s central bank, vegetable prices, as measured by the consumer price index, were up 23.11 percent in mid-May.Tomatoes, potatoes, onions, cauliflower, cowpeas, French beans, bitter gourd, smooth gourd, squash, okara, leafy vegetables, button mushrooms, broccoli, lime, chilli green, capsicum, and cucumbers became pricier within a month.Binay Shrestha, information officer at the Kalimati Fruits and Vegetable Market Development Board, the country’s largest vegetable trading centre, said supply of home-grown vegetables had dwindled right from the winter. The shortfall is met with imports, mainly from India.As soon as the monsoon started, flooding and landslides affected the supply system, sending prices high, he added.And there are no signs of the prices falling. “Naturally, vegetable prices rise during the monsoon as rainfall impacts output and supply.”Shrestha said the Kalimati fruits and vegetable market is receiving vegetables in smaller volumes these days. Before the monsoon the market received 700 tonnes of vegetables daily, but it has now dropped to 500 tonnes.The monsoon season in Nepal generally begins on June 13 and ends on October 2. This year, the phenomenon entered Nepal from the southwest on June 10, three days ahead of the usual onset date.The comparative supply figure shows that the daily vegetable arrival in the Kalimati fruits and vegetable market declined 7 percent within a month.Tomato, potato, and onion prices have seen a significant fluctuation.The average wholesale price of tomato big (Nepali) has increased by 36.36 percent to Rs75 per kg within a month. However, the price of small tomatoes produced in plastic tunnels has declined by 42.17 percent to Rs22.67.Shrestha said tomato prices in the summer fall due to increased production as tunnel farming is not affected by rains, and new farming systems have flourished.On June 18 last year, farmers threw around 90 tonnes of tomatoes on the road outside the Kalimati fruits and vegetable market to vent their anger at the low prices they were getting. The price of tomato big (Nepali) had plummeted to Rs35 per kg.Shrestha expected that the tomato price would not dip any lower.The wholesale price of potato (Indian) increased by 9.94 percent to Rs51.67 per kg.The price of Mude potato, produced in summer in high-altitude places like Mude of Sindhupalchok, increased by 4.08 percent to Rs51 per kg. The average wholesale price of onion (dry) increased by 47.09 percent to Rs97.67 per kg within a month. Vegetable traders said that onion prices have increased due to the Indian export tax policy.In May, India lifted the ban on onion export after nearly five months but imposed a minimum export price of $550 per tonne.The price of cauliflower also increased by 72.73 percent to Rs95 per kg during the review period. The price of cowpea (short) increased by 23.91 percent to Rs95 per kg, and the price of French bean (local) increased by 25 percent to Rs65 per kg.Bitter gourd now costs Rs45 per kg, rising by 28.57 percent within a month.Smooth gourd price sharply increased by 57.14 percent to Rs55 per kg.The price of squash round jumped 40 percent to Rs35 per kg within a month, while the price of okara shot up by 154.63 percent to Rs55 per kg.The price of mustard greens rose 106.22 percent to Rs55 per kg, and mustard leaf rose by 55.56 percent to Rs35 per kg.Button mushroom prices increased by 5.56 percent to Rs316.67 per kg.Even in its season, cucumber price has increased significantly. The price of cucumber (local) increased by 58.33 percent to Rs95 per kg while that of hybrid cucumber rose by 80 percent to Rs45 per kg.The price of capsicum increased by 2.27 percent to Rs45 per kg, while the cost of green chilli increased by 25 percent to Rs95 per kg. \nOn May 28, presenting the financial plan for the upcoming fiscal year, Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun said all the 77 districts of the country are now connected by the national road network.But the ground reality is different.Without a bridge over the Karnali river at Chuwa Khola of Kharpunath rural municipality, Simkot, the district headquarters of Humla, remains to be connected to the national road network. Villagers in the northwestern corner of Nepal bordering Tibet in China where the Humla Karnali crosses face hardships in the absence of one bridge.Though the track was opened to Simkot in mid-April, the construction of the bridge has yet to be completed. As a result, a 12 km section still needs to be completed to connect the district headquarters.Now, vehicles carrying goods along the Karnali Corridor can only reach Kharpu. From there, the goods have to be transported by helicopters and carried over the river using cables, resulting in additional costs. This method, however, is possible only when the water level is low. Due to the lack of a bridge, around ten vehicles bought for government offices and passenger service via Surkhet were taken across the river using ropes and a bulldozer. The cars are now operating on the Simkot side.In 2007-08, the government announced in the annual budget that it would connect Simkot to the national road network. However, even after a decade and a half, Simkot is not connected to the national road network.In September 2021, the joint venture of Swachchhanda, Mount, and Pumori was awarded the Rs110 million contract for the bridge. The construction companies were issued Rs11 million in advance, and the project completion deadline was fixed in March this year.However, the company did not start the construction work for a long time, and around a year ago, it was necessary to change the design.“The joint venture company was responsible for constructing a 55-metre-long motorable truss bridge. But when the contractor started to dig the foundation, a hot water spring was found,” said Bel Bahadur Nepali, chief of the Simikot-Hilsa Road Construction Project. “The assessment showed that the bridge will not be durable if it is constructed on the existing design. So, we made the new design, which got approved two weeks ago. We will start the bridge construction work in July.”Nepali said that with the change in design, the contractor has been given a new deadline to complete the project: August 2025.Binod Kumar Pokharel, chief district officer, said the locals have demanded a Bailey or portable bridge as it may take time to complete the project. “Due to the lack of a bridge, the travellers are facing hassles. The passenger and goods transport charges too are high.”Pokharel said the river's flow is high throughout the year, so vehicles must be towed across the river with the help of an earthmover to Simkot. “To solve the problem, the locals have demanded a Bailey bridge. We are assessing the need.”Until last year, vehicles were operated from Khulalu of Kalikot towards Mugu-Bajura-Sillisalla of Humla. Nepali said that the 39 km road track was opened this year. This year, a 39-kilometre stretch was added. The project opened 8 km of the total track, and the Nepal Army did the work on the remaining 9 km section. The road from Khulalu of Kalikot to the Chinese border is 268 km long. Of this, 95 km south of Simkot is served by transportation. However, as the vehicle flow is breached by the lack of a bridge, passengers from Simkot to Khapunath rural municipality must change the vehicle by crossing suspension bridges on foot.Dan Bahadur Shahi, a senior citizen, said since there is no bridge, vehicles are charging higher fares. Jeeps run on the 12km Simkot-Kharpu stretch. The vehicle operators charge Rs700 to Rs1,000 per person as fare for a special arrangement called “reserve”. In similar fashion, the jeep operated from Kharpu via Sillisalli to Surkhet charges Rs7,000 per person, he said.“We are compelled to change the vehicle as there is no bridge. While crossing the river using the suspension bridge, we need to pay wages to a porter,” Shahi said. “If there were a bridge, we would be able to reach Surkhet by a single vehicle, and the fare would be less.”The price of daily consumable goods in Simkot is sky high, too. “No goods-carriers operate here; small jeeps are permitted to carry passengers only. This means we have to transport goods using porters so the prices refuse to come down,” said Bhim Bahadur Rokaya, a trader at Simkot.“There is no chance of prices falling unless a bridge is constructed across the Kharpu river, allowing for goods to be ferried by trucks,” Rokaya said.Pokharel said that because route permits are issued only from Khulalu of Kalikot to Sillisalli, fares are not fixed. “We have directed the Transport Management Office, Jumla, to manage the route permit and fare. The decision will be taken soon by a meeting of the transportation management committee.” \nThe Epidemiology and Disease Control Division says it has been closely monitoring the outbreak of the Zika virus in India, as the spread of the deadly disease is a matter of serious concern in neighbouring Nepal due to multiple risk factors.Currently, Nepal is tackling a dengue outbreak, and the same vectors—Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus—that spread the dengue virus also spread the Zika virus.“Unrestricted cross-border movements of people from the two countries and the proximity and presence of virus-spreading vectors are the main risk factors,” said Dr Gokarna Dahal, chief of the Vector Control section at the Division. “Some hospitals and laboratories carry out other tests when they get negative reports of patients having dengue-like symptoms.”Zika causes microcephaly, a condition in which babies are born with underdeveloped head and brain damage. It is also linked to Guillain-Barre syndrome, a condition in which the immune system attacks the nerves causing muscle weakness and sometimes paralysis.Last week, India reported three cases of zike infection in Maharashtra state. Since 2016, India has witnessed Zika outbreaks every year except in 2019 and 2020.A risk assessment survey carried out in 2018 with the technical and financial support of the World Health Organisation showed that Nepal was a high-risk country for dengue and Zika outbreaks.Dengue-spreading mosquitoes—Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus—also transmit Zika and Chikungunya viruses, which means the vectors are present throughout the country.Doctors say all that is needed for an outbreak is a Zika-infected person, which could be anyone. Outbreaks of the disease in India every year and global movement of the people have increased the risk of an outbreak in our country too, according to them.The Ministry of Health and Population had carried out Zika surveillance in the past and tested samples of people having dengue-like symptoms, but the results came back negative, according to Dahal. The World Health Organisation Nepal had provided financial as well as technical support to acquire the technology to carry out the testing of the viruses, officials said.Doctors say Zika virus symptoms match those of the dengue virus—mild fever, rashes, muscle pain, headache, red eyes and a general feeling of discomfort in up to 80 percent of cases.Studies show that pregnant women and their foetuses are at high risk of Zika infection, as the virus causes microcephaly in the foetus.Zika virus was first identified in Uganda in 1947 in monkeys, according to the UN health agency. It was later detected in humans. Brazil saw the worst outbreak of the virus in 2015 and it has since then spread to 24 other countries. The WHO had declared Zika outbreak an international health emergency in 2016.Meanwhile, Nepal has recorded at least 1,268 dengue cases since January this year. Of the 72 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases: 141.Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. \nIn June last year, a measles outbreak was reported in Kathmandu’s Gokarneshwar Municipality. Along with Kathmandu of Bagmati Province, the outbreak of the deadly disease was reported in several districts of Lumbini, Karnali, Sudurpaschim, Koshi, and Madhesh provinces.And in less than a year of that outbreak, health authorities concerned have been gearing up to declare the entire Madhesh Province fully immunised.“We are all prepared to declare the Madhesh Province fully immunised,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “All the districts of Madhesh Province have been already declared fully covered, and we have decided to declare the province fully immunised.”To declare an area as fully immunised, all children under 15 months old residing there must be administered all vaccines of the routine immunisation programme.Child health experts doubt the claim that all eligible children of the Madhesh Province have been administered the routine vaccines. They say the decision to declare a fully immunised province could raise a sense of complacency in the public, which will ultimately backfire.“Most of the districts across the country have already been declared fully immunised, and the fact is outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases, including measles, keep getting reported,” said Dr Shyam Raj Upreti, former director general at the Department of Health Services. “Declaration of a fully immunised province could create a sense of complacency in the public. We also declared the entire country open-defecation-free years ago, but outbreaks of waterborne diseases, including diarrhoea and cholera, have not stopped.”Experts say many districts across the country have already been declared fully literate but it’s hard to believe that all the districts are indeed fully literate.“For the last four months, we have been launching extensive vaccination programmes to achieve the target of a fully immunised province,” said Dr Rajiv Jha, chief of the Provincial Health Directorate of Madhesh Province. “We have also carried out the survey and found 100 percent of children between 15 to 23 months are immunised.”Experts, however, say it is impossible to achieve fully immunised status, as babies are born every hour and every day. Coverage of most health programmes is low in Madhesh Province compared to districts of other provinces. People of certain communities go to maternal homes for child delivery and return months after, and the risk of missing the routine vaccination is high there, according to them.Vaccine coverage is low among people living along the Nepal-India border who keep travelling to India frequently. Most of them opt out of vaccine programmes run by both Nepal and India. Health experts say low vaccination coverage, internal migration, a lack of awareness of importance of vaccines, and government apathy are among the reasons for regular outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases.“Due to cross border movements, the trend to go to maternal homes for child delivery, lack of awareness about the importance of vaccination and hygiene and sanitation conditions, risk of children missing routine vaccines is high in Madhesh Province,” said Upreti. “More than the declaration of full immunisation, sustaining that status is very crucial. Childhood vaccination is a continuous process, which never ends, meaning that the target is never achieved.”The Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022, carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population, showed that at least four percent of children aged 12 to 23 months have received no vaccination.The number of children missing basic antigens in the routine immunisation programme in Madhesh Province was also staggering. According to the report, the immunisation coverage rate in Madhesh Province is only 68 percent, which means 32 percent of children in the province didn’t take all the vaccines. It is the lowest of all the seven provinces.The government provides 13 types of vaccines through the national immunisation programme. Gandaki Province has a 93 percent vaccine coverage rate, the highest in the country. The vaccine coverage in Sudurpaschim Province, which is considered less developed and less educated, is 89 percent.The vaccination coverage rate is 81 percent in Koshi, 83 percent in Bagmati, 85 percent in Lumbini, and 84 percent in Karnali Province.Immunisation is considered the most cost-effective and efficient way to control and eliminate vaccine-preventable diseases that contribute to childhood illnesses and deaths. \nAt least 1,072 people from across the country have been infected with A(H1N1), also known as the swine flu virus, since January, this year.Data provided by the National Public Health Laboratory shows that 373 others were infected with the influenza B virus, 75 with the A (H3) virus, also known as Hong Kong Flu, 13 with co-infection of swine flu and coronavirus, and two with co-infection of influenza B and coronavirus. What concerns public virologists and infectious disease experts in Nepal is that less than one-fifth of cases of influenza-like illnesses are diagnosed, and neither the doctors attending patients nor the authorities concerned bother to know the real cause of ailments. They say that of the swab samples of 8,739 people with an influenza-like illness, only 1,743 tested positive for various kinds of influenza. “The cause of ailments of the rest of people are not known, which should be a cause of serious concern to the researchers as well as policymakers,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “The criteria for collecting the swab samples for influenza test is that patients should have an influenza-like illness, but only less than one-fifth of samples are testing positive for influenza.”The laboratory only maintains a record of the positive cases but does not tell anything about fatalities due to infections. Experts say the number of people infected with influenza could be several times higher than the data provided by the laboratory, as many people suffering from influenza-like illness do not seek treatment. Even for those who do seek treatment, in most cases, the underlying cause of their ailments often remains undiagnosed. “The next pandemic could also be a pandemic of respiratory viruses,” said Pun. “We will not be able to lessen the risk of outbreaks in future if we continue ignoring the risks. Authorities must step up surveillance and investigate the underlying causes of these ailments.”A recent report by the Nepal Statistics Office also shows that cold and fever remain a significant concern, with an increase from 43.7 percent in 1995/96 to 51. 5 percent in 2022/23.Doctors say more people get infected with viruses during the seasonal changes, as most viruses—adenovirus, rhinovirus, influenza virus, and even coronavirus—become active during these times and winter.But this does not mean respiratory viruses do not spread at other times. “People are getting continuously infected with respiratory viruses in other seasons as well. Those with weak immunity could become more severely affected by the infection,” said Dr Raju Pangeni, a pulmonologist. “Besides urging people to take precautions against these risks, authorities must step up surveillance measures to know the real causes of influenza-like illnesses.”As very few people in Nepal receive flu shots. Experts say unvaccinated elderly people and those with compromised immunity are at risk of severe respiratory virus infections.Doctors say the influenza virus causes respiratory complications, which affect the lungs. It quickly spreads in communities. The diseases can cause fever, cough, body aches, occasional vomiting, diarrhoea and pneumonia.They say that early diagnosis is crucial for preventing infection. Patients recover quickly if treated on time. Both the severity of the disease and the number of deaths increase if seasonal influenza cases are not diagnosed on time, according to experts. \nNineteen-year-old Ekta suffers from excruciating pain during her periods. It is far beyond the usual pain and cannot be managed with medication–she’s tried that multiple times. Taking one dose of Meftal (a period pain medication) is never enough. The pain is debilitating most of the time.Despite several visits to gynaecologists, her complaints have been brushed aside as normal period pains. She strongly feels that her pain is abnormal, but feels powerless to address her issues.“The pain is so bad, but I cannot do anything about it,” she says. “I can’t count the number of times that I’ve been told that my debilitating pain is normal,” bemoans Ekta, whose name has been changed to protect her privacy.The normalisation of period pains means serious reproductive conditions like endometriosis often go untreated. People with endometriosis experience severe pelvic pain because tissues like that found outside the uterus grow inside it. Other symptoms of the condition include heavy bleeding during and between periods and fatigue. There is no known cure for this condition, and symptoms can start from the first period onwards.A major challenge experienced by women with endometriosis is the disregard of their symptoms by the public and medical professionals alike. Due to lack of awareness about the debilitating pain typical to endometriosis, both the person suffering from the condition, and their doctors often underestimate their severity.Severe pelvic pain is a key indicator for diagnosing endometriosis, says Dr Reena Shrestha, a gynaecologist at Madhyapur Hospital. When patients seek consultation regarding the kind of severe pain that significantly disrupts their lives, they may undergo two types of tests: transvaginal ultrasound and diagnostic laparoscopy. These procedures are used to determine the presence of endometriosis. Endometriosis is a complex condition, says Dr Hema Pradhan, a consultant gynaecologist at Everest Hospital. Amongst all the patients she meets at her consultations, many frequently turn out to have endometriosis. But, she’s noticed that often patients often delay seeking treatment because period pains are often normalised.“Women who come to me with their symptoms often delay seeking treatment, because, regardless of the severity of their pain, they believe all period pains to be normal,” says Pradhan.Eighteen-year-old Rima (name change) has been struggling with excessive pain before and during periods for years. She also experiences pain while urinating during her periods. Rima has also been diagnosed with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS). The co-occurence of PCOS and endometriosis is not unheard of, although research on them has been minimal.“I can barely walk when I’m on my periods, but I’ve always been told that I should just learn to live with it,” she says.Despite knowing about PCOS, she discovered the possibility of having endometriosis quite later in life. She shares this because period pain, even excessive ones, have been normalised for far too long.The general lack of awareness of endometriosis, and widespread normalisation of period pains, often results in late diagnosis and treatment of the condition.Although there may be no cure to the condition, there are ways to manage its most severe symptoms. Furthermore, receiving a diagnosis can greatly help patients to understand the severity of their condition, according to doctors. “I’m incapable of doing anything during my periods. One time I had to leave the examination in the middle of my exams because of the pain,” says Ekta. “I can’t study, can’t work, all I can do is stay in bed and cry,” she adds.Dr Pradhan reveals another challenging aspect of diagnosing endometriosis. Sometimes the condition may not appear on ultrasound scans initially. Endometrial deposits may appear differently in women due to hormonal changes. Furthermore, symptoms may vary, with some being asymptomatic altogether. According to Dr Shrestha, once a gynaecologist confirms that the patient has endometriosis, they will certainly recommend methods to manage the pain. These include analgesics for pain relief, and home remedies like hot water bag massage.However, the main problem remains. Due to lack of awareness, most patients may only find out about their condition later in life.In some cases women only discover they have endometriosis when they face infertility. Endometriosis is associated with infertility, and 30-50% of people with endometriosis may experience infertility. This also exposes another troubling aspect associated with endometriosis. Ekta shares that her relatives often express concerns about her potential infertility.“They just make me feel bad that I might never get pregnant. And it makes me feel worse,” Ekta adds.Worldwide, endometriosis has been known as a scientifically under-researched condition. It has even been called the ‘missed disease’ because of inconsistencies in its diagnosis and treatment. Endometriosis has also been widely ignored by policy makers.Treatment for endometriosis depends on the individual, says Dr Pradhan. Some are treated with hormonal medication, and others require surgical procedures. The main way to combat endometriosis is timely diagnosis, and timely treatment, she adds.“Raising awareness, timely diagnosis, and treatment are very important,” Dr Pradhan says. \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra, a Nepali chef in New York, established \"The Sewing Tin\" to promote Nepali cuisine, blending traditional flavors with modern techniques and addressing challenges faced by outsiders while highlighting the importance of culinary passion and storytelling.\nCeleus Baral, an environmental science student and baker, runs an online baking shop (Bakeleus) while promoting sustainability and sharing baking expertise through recipes and her zero-waste policy.\nPotatoes, a widely consumed staple in Nepal, provide numerous nutrients, and are cultivated in diverse climates and imported for various products, including popular snacks like chips and fries, offering health benefits but requiring moderation for those with diabetes.\nIn a challenging and transformational journey from film production to an Everest trek, the author grapples with life's uncertainties, embraces nature's lessons, and discovers resilience and meaning while striving for a summit.\nA group of journalists experienced Sri Lanka's natural beauty, heritage sites, and economic recovery (including its tourism sector) during a six-day tour covering 1,000 kilometers.\nNepal offers diverse destinations for exploration, including new cultural treks like Mundhum and the ancient Janaki Mandir, along with picturesque trekking in Kuri Village, Annapurna Base Camp, and wildlife experiences in Bardiya and Khaptad National Parks.\nThe author reminisces about his homecoming to Phidim, a transformed town that faces a worrying trend of outmigration due to a lack of prospects.\nBara Imambara, a historical monument in Lucknow (the \"City of Nawabs\") built in 1784, features the magnificent Asafi Mosque, the vast pillarless Asafi Hall with the tomb of Asaf-ud-Daula, the labyrinthine Bhool Bhulaiyaa, and the underground Shahi Baoli with a unique CCTV-like design.\nUruguay emerged as Group C winners at Copa America, eliminating host nation the United States despite a heated matchup marked by physical altercations, injuries, and questionable refereeing.\nPanama beat Bolivia 3-1 to qualify for the Copa America quarter-finals, eliminating hosts USA, while Uruguay won the group with nine points.\n“Time beat him. Time takes everybody out. It’s undefeated,” said Rocky Balboa in the film “Creed” and those words could easily be applied to Portugal’s Cristiano Ronaldo who struggled to impose himself on their Euro 2024 last-16 game with Slovenia on Monday.A tearful Ronaldo being embraced and comforted by team mates after missing a penalty in extra time that could have helped Portugal secure a spot in the quarter-finals before a shootout win is a cathartic image that stunned fans around the world.Portugal won 3-0 on penalties minutes later, with Ronaldo converting the first spot kick and apologising to fans in the stands immediately after scoring before breaking down in tears following the game and being unable to finish an interview.His tears showed more than just the sorrow or guilt of a player feeling the weight of responsibility from almost letting his country down. They were the tears of a frustrated player who expects greatness but was not the difference-maker he once was.During the 2022 World Cup Ronaldo said: “The best timing is my timing” as he arrived in Qatar with his career in turmoil, about to leave Manchester United to play in Saudi Arabia.Ronaldo, a five-times Ballon D’Or winner, had arrived with a mission to prove he could still make a difference on the world stage. But he ended the tournament on the bench and had no impact as a substitute in the 1-0 quarter-final loss to Morocco.After that defeat, the shocking image of Ronaldo running to the tunnel in tears as desolate as the football world had ever seen him was something Portugal fans were not used to.But with long-time Portugal manager Fernando Santos gone and newcomer Roberto Martinez trusting him with the captaincy and a leadership role in a young and talented squad, Ronaldo was given another shot at glory in Euro 2024.Despite being a model of longevity for more than two decades in an outstanding career, breaking numerous records and playing for some of the biggest clubs in the world, Ronaldo has been a shadow of his old self over the last two weeks in Germany.Lacking the speed, explosion and agility that were his trademarks while pouncing on balls like a tiger to plunder goals in various ways that only he was able to, the 2024 version of Ronaldo has yet to score at this Euros after four games.Against Slovenia, just as in the previous three games, his shooting was off-kilter and his headers failed to trouble keeper Jan Oblak while his team mates seemed to be forcing the ball to him, disrupting Portugal’s tempo and slowing them down.At 39, Ronaldo would have become the oldest player to score in a European Championship if he had netted his extra-time penalty but he failed to beat the excellent Oblak and instead of relief came desperation.Martinez still trusted him to take the first penalty in the shootout and Ronaldo duly delivered to help Portugal stay alive at the Euros, with several records that he is still seeking.They will face France in the quarter-finals with the world questioning whether Ronaldo’s brilliant international career is nearing an end. There could still be a happy ending for one of the world’s greatest ever players - only time will tell. \nGoalkeeper Diogo Costa saved all three penalties as Portugal won 3-0 in a shootout against a brave Slovenia side who had held them to a 0-0 draw after Cristiano Ronaldo’s extra-time miss from the spot in a dramatic Euro 2024 last-16 clash on Monday.Portugal had the lion’s share of the chances but also their brilliant goalkeeper to thank for a one-on-one save from Slovenia striker Benjamin Sesko as they stumbled into a quarter-final meeting with France in Hamburg on Friday.Costa also saved from Josip Ilicic, Jure Balkovec and Benjamin Verbic in the shootout - the first keeper to save three penalties in a Euros shootout - to send his side through despite a team performance that lacked spark for the most part.“This is probably the best game of my life,” Costa said. “I focused on doing what I had to do. I went with my gut feeling. Of course we had analysed the penalty takers, but players change how they shoot. I'm very happy and very excited to have helped the team.”Ronaldo in particular will come under the spotlight as he wasted several opportunities to go with a penalty miss in extra-time that left him in a flood of tears and needing to be consoled by team mates.Portugal were awarded the penalty late in the first half of extra time when Diogo Jota’s storming run into the box was illegally stopped by defender Vanja Drkusic, who had already been booked and was lucky not to receive a second yellow card.They have a reliable penalty taker in their team in Bruno Fernandes but captain Ronaldo elected to take it and his effort was superbly saved to his left by Slovenia’s Jan Oblak, who pushed the ball onto the post.“Even the strongest people have their (bad) days. I was at rock bottom ... when the team needed me the most,” Ronaldo said in a post-match interview before bursting into tears again.“Sadness at the start is joy at the end. That’s what football is. Moments, inexplicable moments,” he said. \nAn 85th-minute deflected shot by Randal Kolo Muani, listed as a Jan Vertonghen own goal, gave France a nervy 1-0 win over a disappointing Belgium on Monday and sent them into the quarter-finals despite another poor show by their misfiring forwards.France made most of the running in a cagey game but were reckless with their finishing, until a nice combination of passes, finished off by N’Golo Kante, finally created space for substitute Kolo Muani to turn and bundle a mishit shot in off the leg of Vertonghen and leave goalkeeper Koen Casteels wrong-footed.France will now meet the winner of Monday’s match Portugal in the quarter-finals in Hamburg on Friday.It was a fittingly scruffy decider for an underwhelming game and means that France still have yet to score in open play at the tournament, recording two own goals and a Kylian Mbappe penalty across their four games.Various combinations have been tried up front, while midfielders and defenders also caught the bug on Monday with some wild attempts, but coach Didier Deschamps, unsurprisingly, preferred to focus on the positives.Belgium clearly had a plan to take any speed out of the game, playing at less than walking pace at times, with Kevin de Bruyne often operating just in front of his back four.The only decent chance of the first half came for France after 34 minutes when Jules Kounde whipped in a curling cross that recalled striker Marcus Thuram headed wide.Aurelien Tchouameni forced Koen Casteels into his first save of the day soon after the break, while ever-lively Mbappe miskicked a decent chance as France began to put some passes together.A rare Belgian thrust was cut short by a brilliant Theo Hernandez tackle just as Yannick Carrasco was about to pull the trigger and Romelu Lukaku and De Bruyne then brought good saves from Mike Maignan.France were in the ascendancy but the poor finishing that has dogged their campaign continued with William Saliba and Mbappe both blazing wildly over before Kolo Muani's decisive intervention.It was a meeting between officially the second (France) and third (Belgium) best teams in the world, but after both edged into the knockout stage managing only two goals apiece from their three games, both looked extremely cautious in attack for most of it.For Belgium, another dispiritingly tame exit adds to their appalling record in the European championship since losing in the final in \nHeavy rain continued to trigger flood and landslides in India’s north and north-east, killing at least 11 people and affecting hundreds of thousands, officials from two affected states said on Tuesday.In India’s most populous state of Uttar Pradesh, which has been hit by torrential rain, nine people died in rain-related incidents in the last 24 hours, an official bulletin said.Two people died on Monday in the north-eastern state of Assam, which has been hit by a second wave of flooding since June 16, affecting more than 600,000 people in 19 districts, and displacing more than 8,000, a state disaster management statement said.Kaziranga National Park in Assam - home to nearly 2,200 one-horned rhinos, or two-thirds of their world population - is also under water, with more than half of its 233 camps flooded, drowning four hog deer, officials said.“The flood water has now entered my house. The water has damaged my paddy and crops. I have a family of five and I have to take shelter here. If the situation worsens, I will lose my house,” Faizul Islam, a local resident told news agency ANI, in which Reuters has a minority stake.Visuals from ANI showed inundated fields and roads across Assam, as people moved precious belongings and furniture from their water-filled homes.In the northeastern region of neighbouring Bangladesh, the flood situation was worsening rapidly due to continuous rain and upstream water flow from India, leaving tens of thousands of people marooned, officials said on Tuesday.Authorities used loudspeakers in the south-eastern region of Chittagong to alert residents about the high risk of landslides, triggered by heavy rains, and offer help in evacuations, government official Abul Bashar Mohammed Fakruzzaman said.India’s north-east and Bangladesh have been ravaged by floods in the last two months, leaving millions stranded, with weather authorities predicting that the situation could worsen.In Assam’s neighbouring state of Arunachal Pradesh, which also borders China, incessant rains have forced the closure of schools in its capital Itanagar, till the end of this week, local officials said.More rain is predicted for the region over the next three days, according to the country’s weather office.India’s weather department issued warnings on Tuesday for heavy to extremely heavy rainfall across western, northern and north-eastern states for the rest of this week. \nRussian missiles struck Starokostiantyniv Air Base as Ukraine prepares to receive US F-16 fighter jets, potentially disrupting Russia's efforts to ground them.\nIndia replaces colonial-era criminal laws with new legislation aimed at enhancing justice but facing criticism from the opposition for potential disruption to the criminal justice system.\nUnauthorised translations of popular books have flooded the Nepali market, disregarding copyright laws and damaging the industry, despite the presence of the Copyright Act.\nIn villages formerly Maoist strongholds, youth fleeing poverty have lost millions via \"tallo bato\" (backdoor route) to America, with eight deported and losing an average of Rs6 million each.\nPrivate hospitals in Pokhara, Chitwan, Biratnagar, and Butwal are ignoring a government mandate to provide free treatment to the poor, despite regulations requiring them to set aside 10% of their beds for the underprivileged.\nIt has been 20 years since the 2005 Hong Kong Ministerial Meeting recognised that developing and, mainly, least developed countries (LDCs) cannot meaningfully participate in the global trading system as envisaged while establishing the World Trade Organization (WTO) without “some kind of support” to enhance their trade capacity. This gave birth to the idea of Aid for Trade (AfT). The WTO claims that AfT is particularly helpful to the LDCs, which “face a range of supply-side and trade-related infrastructure obstacles which constrain their ability to engage in international trade.” In theory, it mobilises resources to address the trade-related constraints identified by these countries.According to WTO data, $556 billion in AfT was disbursed between 2006 and 2020. AfP’s priority and focus naturally shift with the tide of time. Initially, it focused more on improving trade logistics and enabling small businesses to trade their generally uncompetitive products, wishfully, in developed countries. Now, the weight of the discourse seems to be inclined to climate change issues arising in every knot of the supply chain, the scope of gender equity in sharing trade benefits, and the digital divide as an additional constraint to LDCs when the global trade in both goods and services is being rapidly digitised.Key questionsHas the AfT really helped developing and least-developed countries build their trade capacities and provided the much-needed market share for their goods (and services) in developed countries? The WTO leadership claims that trade (solely?) lifted 1.5 billion people out of abject poverty. It appears as if the global population’s poverty reduction is only because of increased cross-border trade and all the official development assistance received by any poverty-stricken country meant only for trade. Nevertheless, the amount in aggregate disbursement under AfT looks impressive. When it comes to the annual average, it is less than $40 billion a year; when divided among the 137 developing out of 217 economies, the dole out is mere symbolism and not enough to undertake even a single medium-sized project. Forty-five countries are still categorised as LDCs, and 32 are small, landlocked economies like Nepal. When viewed through the challenges faced in accessing trade passage through another sovereign territory, the correlation between their LDC status and landlockedness can’t just be coincidental.For instance, according to the Creditor Reporting System of OECD, Nepal received over $300 million as AfT until 2019. The Enhanced Integrated Framework under the WTO supported the development of the Nepal Trade Integration Strategy (NTIS) to identify the goods with import potential and to conduct several studies like the e-readiness of the businesses. Nepal has developed three versions of the NTIS in the last 15 years—in 2010, 2016 and 2023. The country has increased the list of products and services from 19 to thirty-six. But export trade has only nose-dived over this period, not only in terms of export-import ratio but also in nominal value.Why have we failed in our trade capacity building so badly, and why couldn't all the financial aid flow in support to this end? More importantly, have these international frameworks and support helped developing and least-developed countries excel in balancing their trade in their favour? More often than not, the answer, sadly, is in the negative. Why are LDCs left behind?The 9th Aid for Trade review took place at the WTO headquarters in Geneva in the last week of June. Sessions like “Trade for All” and “Realizing LDCs’ Trade Potential” were also part of the rituals. The reasons for LDCs’ failures may be aplenty, including their inability to set production and trade priorities, bad governance and political instability. However, in the true sense, they are not supported throughout this process. Instead, these voiceless countries are incessantly derided for not doing enough, being reactive, making negativity a survival tactic, and being angry and critical of the Western developed countries for no reason. The reality is different. These essentially neo-colonial narratives are created to cover up the developed countries’ intentions to extend their trade protectionism. They lecture on the developing and poor countries on the perils of climate change while failing to change their own lifestyle and renunciating their luxuries, even partially. Such annual rituals, even publications, highlight achievements that hardly reflect ground reality in the countries concerned; instead, feigned diplomatic niceties rule the roost.Contentious issues like the possibility of the supply chain being destroyed by the Russia-Ukraine war, the trade wars between the major trade partners in the world, like the US and China and India and China, and their gross violations of global trade rules, are hardly discussed in detail. The discussion on peripheral issues chosen by “experienced” consultants makes it easy to evade truly excruciating issues. Underdeveloped and developing countries are instructed to transform into a green economy. But the governments and citizens of developed countries who are using air conditioners, refrigerators and fossil fuel vehicles on a mammoth scale are not ready to give up their lifestyles. The underdeveloped world, which consumes only a very small part of it, is held guilty. The developed countries have no intention of reducing major carbon emissions, and it looks impossible given their consumption patterns. Seventy percent of the electricity consumed by developed countries comes from coal, diesel and petrol plants. Air travel and cargo shipment are unlikely to be replaced by green energy for the next several decades.There is nothing for least-developed countries to sell in the competitive global trade. They cannot be expected to produce and sell high-quality, refined and high-value-low volume goods. They can sell either agricultural products or primary or secondary raw materials. It can never be a profitable and sustainable trade. Lately, organic products have suddenly become the import priority of developed countries. But have chemical fertilisers and pesticides been explored and diffused by developing countries? The production system of the developing world became dependent on harmful fertilisers and pesticides produced and aggressively traded by the developed countries. How, then, will these agriculture-based economies trade with new phyto-sanitation and other rules?Worst of all, the West has monopolised the knowledge products, knowledge systems and discourses related to the trade vulnerability of the LDCs. This has created a significant barrier even for a dispassionate debate on it. The LDCs are once again at the receiving end of the so-called global system—trade. \nSummer has had its time, and monsoon mayhem will make headlines for the next few months. This has continued for ages, and with a changing climate, it is likely to increase. We can’t stop monsoons from entering our territory, nor do we want to; they are the lifeline of Nepal’s agriculture, food security, biodiversity, water recharge and many more. We can’t modify its onset, spread and intensity. However, we would be keenly interested in knowing about its arrival, its impacts, its impact area, and its victims. The progress in hydromet science allows us to forecast rainy days, hot days, cold days and many other hydromet phenomena with reasonable spatial and temporal accuracy. When combined or overlaid with exposure and vulnerabilities (poverty, house structures, settlement locations, etc.), forecasts can tell us who will be affected the most, where and when. This is possible through “impact-based forecast” (IBF). So, why not use this knowledge and gear ourselves up to act whenever we have such information? Well, things have already begun, and it’s time to mainstream this approach to managing disaster risks. The “anticipation or anticipatory action” approach entails acting ahead of predicted hazards to prevent or reduce acute humanitarian impacts before they fully unfold. Anticipatory action, as such, is an integral part of disaster risk management, and it systematically links forecast information to actions that can help reduce disaster impacts and protect lives and livelihoods. When you have credible information about a hazard with its occurrence (time and location) reasonably known, there cannot be any excuse for inaction. Since there are now reasonably accurate forecasts of many natural hazards, it is a matter of using forecast science and information in decision-making. Anticipatory action (AA) is yet to be fully integrated into risk management policies and practices in many countries. However, the intention is to make it an integral part of Disaster Risk Management (DRM) thinking and practice. Some operational challenges and “perceived” difficulties are associated with its integration. Here, I discuss some of those challenges in Nepal’s context. First and foremost is the complexity of the narrative itself. Therefore, the first step is to simply demystify the narrative of anticipation—what it means and doesn’t. In Nepal, anticipatory action was first introduced as “forecast-based financing” (in 2015-16), where rainfall forecasts from the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology were used to inform and prepare organisations to respond better and quicker to looming floods. Somewhere during 2016-17, some of the Disaster Preparedness and Response Plans (DPRPs) and the national DRR Strategic Plan of Action also tried to incorporate anticipation. Nevertheless, those initiatives remained ephemeral as they were marred with classical problems of being supply-driven and top-down and needing more compelling evidence. Furthermore, there was little investment in clarifying the approach, follow-up and communication, as well as strengthening capacities and building systems. Second, to a larger extent, AA has been siloed within non-state actors (mainly with the I/NGOs, UN and donors) and has been limited to small-scale “pilots”. Though the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority (NDRRMA) is now taking it up, it has not yet been systematically integrated into the government's disaster risk management thinking and practice. Nepal needs a government-led process that brings actors together to agree on an operational framework, harmonise the approach, charter a pathway and milestones, and reinforce mutual accountability. NDRRMA should encourage actors to get out of their “minuscule pilots” and facilitate bigger and scalable impacts. In the meantime, the actors/stakeholders should join hands to support the government in developing and implementing plans for anticipation at scale for different hazards. The obsession with quick wins and tangible results is another classical problem facing many donor-funded initiatives; AA is no exception. While such pursuits are soothing and pleasing, they do not always produce durable and sustainable solutions. Therefore, the donors must emphasise “building/strengthening systems” for anticipatory action through what they call the “build money”. The government needs to strengthen the systems, capacity and infrastructure for the governments to use weather forecasts as decision-support information. Meanwhile, the donor priority for anticipatory action mustn't crowd out funding for long-term preparedness, risk reduction and resilience building. Anticipatory action can be implemented at scale only through a robust disaster risk management system. Sustainable funding for implementing anticipatory action should ideally come from the local and provincial governments. While the federal government, donors and non-state actors can support strengthening systems and capacities, the “fuel money” should come from the local governments, allowing for the implementation of anticipatory actions for imminent threats. The policy and legislative interventions/reforms should empower governments to earmark a portion of their coffer to act ex-ante and release funds for anticipatory actions based on the imminent threat of a hazard. This is not technical and administrative but rather political; it requires bold decisions, innovation and accountability.  \nDuring my recent visit to Bajura District, I explored olive farming and witnessed its current state in the region. My interaction with Janesh Bhandari, a local civic campaigner, revealed the unfortunate stagnation of a once-promising project. Funded by the Italian government with approximately 1.4 million Euros allocated for Kathmandu, Dolpa and Bajura, this project saw half of the funds directed to Bajura alone. Preliminary research identified that out of 28 species planted, 24 bore fruit, and 10 were recommended for Nepal.Following the success of the pilot study, the Government of Nepal (GoN) has designated Bajura, encompassing the municipalities of Jagannath, Himali, Swamikartik and Budhinanda, as an olive zone. In 2016, an Olive Zone Implementation Unit was established under the Prime Minister Agriculture Modernisation (2015-25) Project. The main goal of this unit is to promote commercial olive farming and enhance the management and utilisation of natural olive forests to increase farmers’ incomes. Despite such significant investment in research, commercial olive farming remains unfruitful, owing to several challenges.ProspectsEmpirical evidence suggests that olive farming in Bajura could serve as a nature-based solution to diversify the local production system. Investing in both wild and domesticated olives could boost household incomes and generate employment in the region. Given the environmental, social and economic benefits, olive cultivation could enhance the resilience and well-being of smallholding farmers. Research also highlights olive as a crop with a high potential for income, employment opportunities and improvement in economic status.Olive oil is a common product in Nepal, but olive wood handicrafts are globally popular. Handicraft items from olive wood fetch high prices, including wooden bowls and plates, which sell at a range of $20-70. Olive oil is also used in producing soaps, scents, skincare and other cosmetics. Nepal imported olive products worth $616,217 in 2022, which shows a year-on-year value growth of 70.38 percent. With olive oil prices in the Nepali market ranging from Rs2,000 to 3,000 per litre, the market potential for olive oil and its diversified products is substantial, making systematic cultivation a promising avenue for import substitution. The Prime Minister's Agriculture Modernisation Project has initiated a programme to construct infrastructure for olive farming and provide relief of Rs427,000 for 2,386 farmers in Bajura.ChallengesDespite Bajura being designated as an olive production zone, several challenges hinder the commercial farming of olives. One major issue is the underutilisation of wild olives due to the lack of collection and processing centres. In addition to these, another challenge was the lack of a three-phase electricity line essential for the production centre's operation, rendering the plant dysfunctional at the moment.Additionally, there is a significant mindset barrier among farmers and local people. Olive trees take five years to bear fruit, and most farmers attracted to faster-yielding crops like apples are reluctant to invest in olive cultivation. The farmers’ economic status exacerbates this reluctance, as they cannot afford to wait for such a long harvest period.Another challenge is the lack of a technically skilled workforce. Some farmers have fallen short of the necessary knowledge about olive cultivation and its benefits, and others have shifted to high-value crops, abandoning traditional farming practices in the region. Educating them about the economic and health benefits of olive farming could prove beneficial. Policy measuresNepal can draw inspiration from Rajasthan, India, where the government actively promoted olive cultivation by introducing Israeli technology and operational models. The Government of India included olives under the national mission on oilseeds and oil palm. After eight years of nurturing olive saplings, this led to the successful launch of Rajasthan's first indigenous olive oil brand. Similarly, Pakistan has seen impressive success in olive farming. In 2022, the country exported virgin and extra virgin olive oil worth $1.9 million. This achievement was enabled by a project launched in 2012 by the Pakistani government, in cooperation with the Italian government, called \"Promotion of Olive Cultivation for Economic Development and Poverty Alleviation\". This project, run through the Pakistan Agriculture Research Council (PARC), has provided Pakistani farmers with training on pruning techniques and technological support. As a result, Italy and Pakistan now enjoy an annual trade relationship worth €2 billion.With the government initiating an olive zone, it is now crucial for local authorities to take ownership of the project and explore the commercial viability of olive oil extraction. Currently, only a few informed individuals at the policy level are aware of the prospects. Disseminating information to local farmers and communities is imperative, as olive is not a part of Nepal's traditional lifestyle and food habits. The government should implement policy measures such as incorporating olive farming into the curriculum of universities and schools. Agricultural universities should encourage students to intern in olive farming regions for practical experience.Once commercial farming is established, Nepal should register with the International Olive Council to gain wider recognition. Agricultural documents should highlight olives as prospective crops, and proper national records should be maintained on the status of wild and commercially farmed olives. Additionally, it is essential to have trained technicians and experts to oversee olive cultivation and farming. With coordinated action from the government, local officials, farmers and other key stakeholders, olive cultivation could become a lucrative endeavour in Nepal. This could help diversify the country's agriculture sector and foster economic development. \nNepal is nominally a federal country being ruled by political leaders and bureaucrats who are still wedded to their old unitary habits. The centre tightly controls and shapes the political structures of provinces. When there is a political ruction in Kathmandu, its tremors shake all seven provinces. This would not have been the case had the provinces been allowed to operate with a high level of autonomy as envisioned by the new constitution. Right now, the provinces cannot even undertake the basic duty of maintenance of law and order. Schedule 6 of the constitution outlines 21 exclusive authorities of the provincial governments, with maintenance of law and order being at the top of the list. Yet the provinces are yet to get their own police forces, which is in contravention of Article 268 (2) of the national charter. The legislation for the adjustment of the Nepal Police personnel was passed way back in 2019. But the actual process has never gotten underway. The reluctant federalists at the centre—including the top leaders of most political parties—are to be blamed for this. Yet they are not alone in being hesitant on the much-needed change. There is disquiet even among police personnel about the new legislation. The Police Personnel Adjustment Act, for instance, authorises the federal government to assign a deputy inspector general of Nepal Police to serve as province police chief. Such officers can be transferred to other provinces or departments of Nepal Police. But in the case of other lower-ranking officers deputed to the provinces, they can then be transferred only within the police units of the respective province. The police force—already rocked by a drastic decline in the interest of youngsters to fill its vacancies—worries that permanently posting certain officials to certain provinces will jeopardise their career prospects. As such, the interest in joining the force would further wane. The police headquarters has intimated to national leaders and lawmakers that there should be more incentives to lure capable personnel into provinces. If that is what it takes to meet one of the core objectives of the federal system, what is stopping the federal government and the national legislature, both of which are constitutionally bound to implement federalism, from pushing for such a change? The representatives of provincial governments are fed up with the lack of the centre’s interest and are again threatening to hit the streets. The internal affairs ministers of all seven provinces plan to meet Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal to build pressure. This protracted saga of police adjustment is just one reminder of how hard it is to implement federalism so long as the country’s political leadership remains reluctant to empower the provinces and local bodies. Had there been any willingness to do so, the nitty-gritty of the relevant legislation could have been worked out. Most police personnel are not refusing to be posted in provinces. They are only asking for the right incentives. In order to make the federal system work, ways must be found to bridge the troubling mismatch between the expectations of employees of vital institutions and the incentives on offer.  \nThe famed “iron gate” called the Secondary Education Examinations has closed for 242,313 students, as 52.14 percent of the examinees failed to secure any grades, being categorised as non-graded. The National Examinations Board on Thursday published the results of the SEE held from March 28 to April 9. Of the 464,785 students who took the 10th-grade final examination, 222,472 (47.86) percent have qualified for further studies. ­­­Those who have been non-graded for up to two subjects will get a chance to reappear for the exams a month later, and the percentage of students entering higher education is expected to go up.The dismal results have once again brought to light the fact that it is high time we changed the teaching-learning system in the country. This year, the students had written their exams on the new syllabus, but the results have not improved. In fact, the results are as bad as the days of the School Leaving Certificate (SLC), the original “iron gate” we had set out to change. Nepal introduced the grading system in 2016 with the hope of reforming the examination system and improving the student pass percentage. However, after eight years of experimenting with the grading system, it is clear that the changes were cosmetic. What we needed was a complete overhaul of the teaching-learning system. Hoping to see changes in the SEE results without changing the fundamentals was immature, as the results over the years have clearly shown.Even today, students in rural government schools, who make up the bulk of the student population, do not get their course books on time; there are no teachers in their schools; and they faced the brunt of the digital divide during the Covid-19 pandemic when urban schools transitioned to online education while their ill-equipped schools shut down completely. Having to take the same exams as the students from elite, urban schools that offer better labs, teachers and access to the English language, and the students from rural and public schools are systematically conditioned to mess up the exams. And in failing hundreds of thousands of students each year, the education system of the country too fails. We are already late in making school education a programme of learning and growth rather than competitive exams. The very idea of a national exam for a country with Nepal’s level of linguistic, ethnic, regional and economic diversities, among others, is flawed. Despite decades of professing affirmative action, we continue to force students to compete in subjects, say Nepali and English, in which they have advantage or disadvantage. Moreover, we are nearing a decade of implementing federalism, which mandates local levels to manage secondary-level education. A one-size-fits-all teaching and examination system does not meet the requirements of a well-rounded education anymore. Many of the students who face the humiliation of being “non-graded” today might excel in technical and vocational education. It is only by recognising and addressing these differences that we can change our school education system for the better. \nAfter a 14-year-long ordeal, involving a seven-year asylum in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and a five-year incarceration in the high-security Belmarsh Prison, Julian Assange, who earned global fame for releasing classified American documents, is finally a free man. Assange, now 51, stepped into freedom outside of an American court in the US Pacific island territory of Saipan on Wednesday after pleading guilty to a criminal count of conspiring to obtain and disclose classified defence documents. As he was sentenced to time he had already served in prison, he was allowed to head home to Australia.Assange’s freedom has come as a relief to his supporters across the globe, especially so for those who value the disclosures made by the company he founded, WikiLeaks. In November 2010, WikiLeaks had released over 250,000 US diplomatic cables with the help of Chelsea Manning, a former US army soldier who was convicted under the US Espionage Act and had her sentence commuted by President Barack Obama. The WikiLeaks exposed, among other things, the fact that the US forces in Baghdad had killed 11 people in a 2007 helicopter attack; criticism of the UK’s military operation in Afghanistan by US commanders and the Afghan president; and thousands of US diplomatic cables that revealed how the US used its embassies for espionage. In 2016, WikiLeaks again came to prominence after exposing thousands of hacked emails of the Democratic National Committee, causing a possible setback for the US Democratic Party presidential candidate Hilary Clinton. WikiLeaks was then accused of collaborating with the Russian government to influence the US presidential elections, which Donald Trump, Clinton’s opponent, won.Shaken by the incriminating revelations on their modus operandi, Western nations, led by the US, launched an all-out war against Assange and WikiLeaks. Assange’s global legitimacy took a hit after Sweden’s abortive attempt to prosecute him for sexual allegations and the Ecuadorian Embassy’s allegation of rude behaviour while staying with them as a refugee-guest. Beyond the questions of his personal conduct, though, Assange continued to be considered a victim of the Western world’s crusade against the free press. Assange found his champions, among other global intellectuals, in Noam Chomsky and Arundhati Roy, both of whom condemned the US government’s anti-democratic attempts at silencing a journalist-crusader. In a strange turn of events, Roy, Indian writer known for speaking on behalf of the freedom of the country’s impoverished Adivasis and Dalits, now faces sedition charges in her home country for a speech she made in 2010. The hounding of Roy is a clear case of the Indian government, led by the right-wing strongman Narendra Modi, silencing dissenting voices. In Nepal, Kailash Sirohiya, the publisher of The Kathmandu Post, spent nine days in jail last month and continues to face prosecution for an alleged forgery of citizenship certificates while in reality, he is being hounded for his publication’s consistent coverage of the corruption allegations against Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane. The abuse of authority to silence journalists, intellectuals and dissenters is a global phenomenon today. Julian Assange’s ordeal is a reality check of the price one must pay for speaking truth to power.  \nIn the Secondary Education Examinations (SEE) conducted this year, over 52 percent of students failed to graduate to grade 11. The National Examination Board had enforced the ‘non-graded’ category from this year. The underperformance of the majority of school students has stirred a fresh debate about the test system. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with former National Planning Commission member Usha Jha, who led the committee that recommended the government to adopt the letter grading system.How do you analyse the SEE results published on Thursday?People have reacted to it with shock, not me. In fact, on the basis of the teaching system that is being practised in our schools, I think the results are good. We get the results based on what and how we teach students. Over 52 percent of students have been categorised as non-graded. We need to identify and address the causes behind the bad results. I have heard some people blame the letter grading system. This is wrong. A form of letter grading system was already there. We only suggested an upgraded form of the system. If we start blaming the system, we won’t find the real cause of the problem. What may be the real causes that you are hinting at?The first is the poor quality of teachers in our country. A form of letter grading system was there even before. But it had two loopholes. First, the government took an approach whereby all students would pass. That gave an impression to the students that they don’t need to study hard. That degraded the quality of their education. Second, there was a system of giving marks based on the students’ performances in theoretical and practical exams. Of the total 100 marks, the practical exams made up 35 marks. Most students were given maximum marks in the practical exams. That helped them get higher grades even if they didn’t do well in theoretical exams. This system encouraged students to neglect theoretical studies. That has caused huge damage to our education system. The letter grade system introduced this year has closed those loopholes. But the letter grading system requires a learning environment. The system was introduced without adequate preparation for its effective implementation. Also, the Covid pandemic disturbed preparatory works at the time. We should have drastically improved classroom teaching practices, and trained teachers across the country because their teaching methods are outdated. They weren’t trained on the grading system. They give lectures and encourage students to memorise while the letter grading system requires a thorough process and encourages result-oriented learning. It doesn’t prioritise marks. Our teachers and schools lacked the capacity to implement the new system. Teachers weren’t trained and prepared. Even now, most teachers don’t know what the letter grading system is. The system is necessary to make our students compete in global markets.While we upgraded the system, we didn’t upgrade the schools and teachers. Our teachers engage only in routine and formal responsibilities such as completing textbook courses before the examinations. This system should be properly internalised not only by teachers and students but also school management, palikas [local units] and parents of the students. Only then can it be effectively implemented. These are the major reasons behind the poor results. How is the students’ performance evaluated in the letter grading system?First, teachers should study a lot. They take reference of the subject matter from the textbook and teach students giving a broader perspective of the matter. They have to engage the students practically on the issue. The students should be regularly evaluated based on their participation and response in study and activities. The teachers should teach them and constantly monitor whether they are learning and making progress. The marking should be based on that. So, in this system, the examination starts from day 1 and everyday activities contribute to their marks. It also takes other activities such as behaviour, understanding, presentation into consideration. Therefore, it is called a regular assessment system based on a thorough process, unlike the traditional three-hour-long yearly examination method. If the teachers aren’t competent to carry out these activities, this idea can’t yield good results. They badly need capacity enhancement. The pedagogy should be remodelled.What was the rationale behind the decision to implement this system?One reason was to upgrade our education’s standard on par with the international standards and make our students fit for global markets. In the course of formulating this policy, we undertook a comprehensive research of international practices. Based on that evidence-based research, we submitted a report to then education minister Giriraj Mani Pokharel. The government studied and endorsed it. Basically, this system was introduced with an objective of upgrading our education system in the changed context. But we lacked preparations to implement this idea.We will make a mistake if we change this system. I heard that the education minister [Sumana Shrestha] decided to make some changes in the policy and allow all non-graded students to sit for chance examinations, whereas the system says only those students who secured non-grades in two subjects can retake exams for the same subjects. There is no point in changing the method to favour even the students who have failed in all the subjects. She should have made it clear what factors made her change the criteria overnight. I cannot understand why the minister made the decision in a haste without considering its impact.In fact, our next step should have been capacity enhancement of teachers. The minister took some right decisions such as separating teachers from political parties. But an incumbent minister changing a system that was implemented by a previous minister would cause a problem. She could have formed a panel to conduct a study to find if the letter grading system is the main cause behind the students’ underperformance. But changing a policy through an order didn’t look good.Results show our students are very poor in mathematics, science and English. What could be the reasons?This is unfortunate. We saw similar trends in previous years as well. Mathematics and science are becoming more challenging. One reason is the lack of sufficient teachers for these subjects. Also, some teachers are under-utilised. Some teachers don’t go to the schools. So special measures need to be taken to manage teachers mainly for these subjects. Otherwise, we will have similar results in the coming years.The committee under your leadership recommended that those getting a GPA below 1.6 have to choose technical courses and those willing to study Grade 11 must score above 1.6 GPA. What was the idea behind that recommendation?The idea was to end the situation of halting students’ study and activities because of their lower grades. We have a government body in the form of the Council for Technical Education and Vocational Training (CTEVT) which has been offering dozens of vocational training based on the needs and interests of people. So our youths can join a suitable CTEVT course. We need more people in vocational fields. Skilled people aren’t available in the country. A large number of people working in technical fields in Nepal are from India. We included the provision in consultation with CTEVT officials. Minister Giriraj Mani Pokharel had also prepared a broad plan to implement the letter grading system and integrate the vocational part in our education system. The present government should improve the education system by enhancing teachers’ capacity and encouraging youths to join vocational training to fill the gaps in the employment market. Are the infrastructure and resources available in our education system sufficient to implement the grading system?Some schools lack even essential resources while in some we find misuse or underuse of resources. So, our education ministry should carry out a comprehensive mapping and find where teachers are required, where they are underutilised and where they are idle. Then, the government can make optimum use of the teachers and make additional investment on need-basis. Such an approach will yield better results. In general, our academic institutions lack resources as there is a trend of allocating insufficient budgets for the education sector. Yes, the letter grading system needs more investment. We have to work on teachers’ capacity enhancement and to provide learning materials to students. When you make an activity participatory, you certainly need resources and investments.Do we need to review our teacher recruitment process and our pedagogy in the universities that produce teachers?The government can consider new requirements while recruiting teachers and train them accordingly. Also, we need to update our curriculum and pedagogy for courses such as BEd and MEd to produce quality teachers. I have doubts about the quality of our graduates, post-graduates and even PhD holders due to the poor teaching and learning environment of our academic institutions. There is a need for more coordination and collaboration between the government and universities to address such issues.In the end, I want to stress that the government should adopt a clear and consistent policy and avoid ad-hoc decisions. The letter grading system is the best and we should push for that despite the challenges in its implementation. Just that it should have been enforced after enhancing teachers’ capacity. The problems we have now are due to lack of preparation. \nThe government’s recent decision to recall ambassadors, particularly Nepal’s envoy to India, just ahead of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s visit to New Delhi, courted widespread controversy. What are the takeaways of the prime minister’s Delhi visit? What is the progress in implementing the trade and transit agreement signed with China and with the BRI projects? Thira Lal Bhusal of the Post sat down with Rupak Sapkota, foreign affairs advisor to the prime minister, for some insights.The government’s decision to recall ambassadors from 11 countries at once has come under heavy criticism. Why did the government take such a decision?In general, it has become a practice of sorts to recall incumbent ambassadors and appoint new ones after changes in the government or in the ruling coalition. This has both merits and demerits. The country’s foreign policy doesn’t change with a change in government. But every government and coalition has its specific policies, programmes and priorities. Therefore, even other countries make changes in political appointments as per the government’s priorities. Our case is a bit different. Ruling coalitions are frequently changed, and so are ambassadors. As there is a high chance of our politics being governed by coalitions given our electoral system, it has become necessary to establish a rational system on ambassadorial appointment. Either the political appointees themselves should voluntarily quit the job and return home just like vice-chair and members of the National Planning Commission do. Or there should be a consensus among major political forces to allow our ambassadors to serve out the full term.The second option of allowing ambassadors to serve out their term sounds better, doesn’t it?Definitely. Some initiatives have been taken with the objective of making our diplomatic appointments more prestigious, merit-based and better-managed. The government in 2019 introduced some criteria on ambassadorial appointments. We have to put more effort into ensuring that our ambassadorial appointees have the capacity to effectively carry out diplomatic duties. Once we establish a system of appointing envoys based on merit and not out of political biases, we can create a situation of allowing them to serve for the full term. Then, a change of coalition wouldn’t affect their continuity. We need to develop such a political consensus, given our geopolitical sensitivity.But the ambassadors appointed in recent years and their activities in host countries have lowered the bar of our diplomacy.We have seen rapid and huge changes in power equations in the world. In view of that, we can see some countries have appointed former ministers and even prime ministers as envoys to the countries with whom they have vital relations. They also appoint such personalities as envoys for a special mission. So, we have to think about ambassadorial appointments from different perspectives based on the changed context. It is high time that all the political forces and leaders agree on a basic point that those who have in-depth understanding and expertise of the field and can work for the best interest of the country will be appointed the country’s ambassadors. If the individual is competent, the person’s affiliation to a political party may not be a problem. But whether the person can work in the best interest of the country must be considered before appointment.But the government itself doesn’t seem serious about maintaining diplomatic decorum. For instance, the June 6 Cabinet meeting decided to recall the ambassador from India just days ahead of the prime minister’s New Delhi visit. There were also reports that the prime minister made the decision reluctantly due to pressure from coalition partners. What is the real story?It is nothing more than a coincidence. There were discussions about making changes in the ambassadorial positions in line with the March 4 changes in the ruling coalition. But it was deferred as the government needed to accomplish some important tasks and convene events such as the investment summit. When the government decided to change our ambassadors, it just happened to coincide with the prime minister’s visit to New Delhi to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It was a coincidence. Despite the decision, the ambassador had sufficient time to properly conclude all his engagements and duties there. The way he facilitated the process during the prime minister’s visit doesn’t reflect any misgivings about the government’s decision. So, it should be taken as a course that is in keeping with our tradition. In recent decades, other countries have given top priority to economic diplomacy, but the selection of our envoys and their activities doesn’t reflect that. Why aren’t we thinking in that direction?Yes, diplomacy in the past used to be one-dimensional, or it was conducted mainly by one particular ministry—the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. These days, many other ministries are engaged with international agencies. Economic diplomacy, labour diplomacy, climate diplomacy and security affairs have become crucial. We have to increase coordination, cooperation and collaboration among relevant agencies to make our international relations more fruitful and in line with the policies and goals set by our government.We have seen profound changes in terms of approaches, perspectives and dynamics of diplomacy in recent decades. All countries have started to give more importance to the competence of diplomats also in view of the increased geopolitical competition and rivalry seen between world powers. Rapid innovation in science and technology has not only eased our lives but also added challenges. We have to handle so many diplomatic engagements. Similarly, the number of international forums where we have to engage are increasing. These days, multilateral diplomacy and engagements have become as important. Even minilateral forums have started to play vital roles in international relations as the world powers have adopted multiple strategies to create their spheres of influence. In the meantime, the role of public diplomacy has become influential. So, a diplomat today must be dynamic and efficient enough to grasp the international situation, understand the sensitivity of the host country, articulate our country’s views efficiently and work in national interest. Therefore, it has become vital to be extra careful while selecting ambassadors.You talked about better coordination but we don’t see any correction in the practice of bypassing the foreign ministry while working with international agencies.Definitely, the foreign ministry is our focal point for all international relations conducted by a ministry or agency of our country. There should be no dispute about that. We need to make the foreign ministry more resourceful. Then, the ministry will have more capacity and efficiency to handle issues related to security, finance, labour and climate.Why have we failed to maintain reciprocity in terms of diplomats’ relations with the leaders of host countries? For example, our ambassadors in some capitals don’t get to meet the host leaders for years while the foreign envoys in Kathmandu can meet our prime minister and foreign minister directly and instantly.We have to see it from two perspectives. One is the power structure. In international relations, we can see the reflection of the asymmetric power relations between the big powers and other countries. The more developed and resourceful country’s influence in a host country can be seen and felt. Second, despite being an envoy from an underdeveloped or a small country, one can have diplomatic relations based on the principle of sovereign equality. It depends on the individual diplomat as well.In Kathmandu, we often err when dealing with foreign envoys. We have to decide what level of importance to give them. Therefore, some initiatives have been taken to correct and maintain consistency by implementing a diplomatic code of conduct that aims to integrate all activities through the foreign ministry. Foreign envoys will follow the system if we implement it consistently, irrespective of changes in the government. For that, there should be a political understanding at the national level.Let’s move to Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s recent India visit. Though it was mainly to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Indian Prime Minister Modi, he held some important political meetings. What are the takeaways from the visit?The visit was important from bilateral, regional and international perspectives. Traditionally, foreign affairs was described as an extended form of domestic affairs. But these days, international affairs have influence over domestic affairs as well. So such meetings and dialogues at the prime minister’s level are important. They exchanged views in a very cordial atmosphere. Of late, we have maintained bilateral dialogues at the political level on a regular basis and that has helped remove misunderstandings. Our prime minister’s emphasis is to hold bilateral dialogues both at the political as well as diplomatic levels in order to settle differences. India has taken this spirit positively.Second, the two prime ministers discussed how to expedite the implementation of the agreements reached between Nepal and India during Prime Minister Dahal’s official visit a year ago. The issue was discussed during the meeting between Prime Minister Dahal and Indian External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar as well. They also expressed satisfaction over progress in the implementation of bilateral agreements mainly in energy trade, connectivity and investment. In recent years, we have seen progress in investment, economic and trade sectors. Yet we still have some differences on border issues. That is an important and positive development in Nepal-India relations in recent years. In the past, when we had some differences on political, border or other issues, that used to badly affect other aspects of our relations. But now, both the countries agree to resolve outstanding issues through dialogue and our trade and all other affairs are moving ahead smoothly. This is the encouraging part of our relations. But border disputes can sour our relations anytime, right? Is there a sense of urgency to resolve it once and for all?The prime minister is for activating the concerned bilateral mechanisms to resolve such issues. He has also invited Indian Prime Minister Modi to visit Nepal. We can expect the Indian prime minister’s Nepal visit in near future. We can make some progress in resolving some outstanding matters such as border issues during the high level visit. I believe we will move ahead in this direction.Any progress on submitting the report of the Eminent Persons’ Group?During the meetings, the prime minister raised overall bilateral issues that include the matter related to the EPG report. I think once the mechanisms are activated and start working, that will create a situation for the report’s submission.Nepal and Bangladesh are completing homework for greater energy trade. India’s facilitation is a must for that. Is there any progress on securing the southern neighbour’s support for that?Progress in energy cooperation is a major achievement of this tenure of the prime minister. The progress is not limited to the bilateral level but goes to the regional level. A Cabinet committee of the Bangladesh government earlier this month approved a proposal to import 40 megawatts of electricity from Nepal. At present, we will use India’s infrastructure to export energy to Bangladesh. But for the long term there is a plan to build a dedicated transmission line for that. This shows it is not only Nepal that is interested in exporting its energy but other countries in this region are also interested in importing Nepal’s electricity. We have also signed an agreement to build a cross border transmission line with China. The doors are being opened for regional trade of our energy. This development will make India more open to importing energy from Nepal.Why are we failing to expedite projects under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) of China?The economic cooperation between Nepal and China has substantially increased after we joined the BRI framework. So, Nepal has been benefitting from the BRI. We see some concern about the lack of progress on certain infrastructure projects to be built under the BRI framework. In fact, we are in a better position to implement the projects because now we can decide what kind of BRI projects are good for us based on the experience of project development and implementation under the BRI in other countries.We are working to finalise the BRI implementation agreement. Nepal wants to move ahead by signing the implementation agreement and developing the projects. Nepal joined the BRI framework based on its need to diversify trade and connect to the world market. The reality is the same now. So, we need to sign the implementation plan and move ahead as soon as possible. When I attended the Boao Forum a few months ago, I found the Chinese authorities and other stakeholders holding debates to build quality and resilient infrastructure. They also have plans to support the capacity enhancement of human resources and transfer technology in the BRI member countries.People mainly link the BRI with big infrastructure projects such as railway, road and transmission connectivity but there is no significant progress on these fronts. What are the roadblocks?In Nepal, no big infrastructure project has been completed on time, be it the Melamchi drinking project, airports, hydropower or road projects. We haven’t developed the capacity to build big projects, and we don’t envision any plan to operate after building it. So, not only with China but also with other countries and agencies, we have to seek support for small and medium-size projects that we can efficiently build and operate. Also, the third version of the BRI action plan has included building not only big but small and smart projects under the framework. We have to push for that. As we build our capacity, we can gradually take up big projects. For instance, now we can build big hydro projects on our own. It wasn’t the case until some years ago. We developed expertise in hydropower by building many small projects in the past few decades and gradually enhanced our capacity. We have already faced problems in operating the Pokhara and Bhairahawa airports. Is there any progress in taking Chinese support to operate the airports?We have to see both aspects—domestic as well as international use—of the airports. The two airports have helped us upgrade the quality of our domestic air travel as the passengers have benefited due to the upgraded infrastructure. The number of domestic passengers in these airports has increased significantly.It is true that there is no progress in terms of operating them as international airports. The government is studying all possibilities of their use based on their unique features. We are exploring various options in international markets to attract adventure tourists to Pokhara. Chinese stakeholders are also holding some promotional activities in Pokhara. Chinese authorities have told us that they are consulting with their provincial bodies and exploring possibilities to run regular flights to Pokhara. Similarly, the government is mobilising our embassies and other stakeholders in certain countries having a large number of Buddhist tourists to operate flights to Bhairahawa, and we have received some positive responses. I believe we will be able to operate regular international flights from these two airports soon.It’s been eight years since we signed the trade and transit agreement with China, which was touted as a historic deal between the two countries. Why haven’t we been able to implement it?Some symbolic steps have been taken in this period. For instance, a shipment was received from a third country [Vietnam] using a Chinese port in September last year. Similar other initiatives have been taken but these are limited to symbolic gestures. We have to prepare infrastructure and some legal basis to implement the agreements in a more result-oriented way. A bilateral meeting is being held this week. The meeting is likely to discuss how to bring the trade and transit protocol in an effective way. This meeting will discuss various issues faced so far and will also pave the way forward. We have also proposed to form a ministerial-level mechanism to oversee overall bilateral issues. The upcoming meeting will sort out various issues.The Chinese side was conducting a feasibility study of the Keirung-Kathmandu cross-border railway project. What is the progress?There is progress in various projects that we are carrying out with Chinese support. The cross-border railway feasibility study is in the final stage. Likewise, the study on the Chhahare-Tokha tunnel project is ongoing. A Chinese team is arriving to conduct a feasibility study of the Hilsa-Simkot road. A process to award a contract to build a friendly bridge at Hilsa with Chinese grants has begun. A foundation stone will be laid there soon. Also, a study to build the Chilime-Rashuwagadhi-Keirung 220kV cross-border transmission line is beginning soon. \nThe mandatory use of National ID cards for government services has ignited controversy, with concerns about delayed card distribution while the government emphasizes its benefits in streamlining data, combating fraud, and enhancing security.\nDespite adopting a federal system in 2015, Nepal faces challenges in implementing the system effectively due to centralized practices, lack of clarity, and political instability, as per Prithvi Subba Gurung, former Gandaki chief minister.\nA parliamentary committee was formed to investigate a cooperative scam, with a task force led by Jiban Pariyar finalizing its terms of reference after extensive negotiations, despite resistance from the ruling parties to include Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane's name in the investigation's scope.\nRain with thunder and lightning is anticipated Tuesday, with heavy rainfall in several Bagmati, Gandaki, Lumbini, Karnali, and Sudur Pashchim provinces, while one or two locations in Gandaki and Lumbini may experience very heavy rainfall.\nExpect cloudy weather with light to moderate rain, thunderstorms, and potential heavy rainfall in Koshi, Bagmati, Gandaki, and Sudur Pashchim Provinces, with warnings issued for very heavy rainfall in some areas.\nMostly cloudy weather with light to moderate rain and potential for heavy rainfall in parts of Koshi, Bagmati, Gandaki, and Sudurpashchim provinces; temperatures range from 15.5°C to 37.4°C.\nCloudy weather, light to moderate rain, and heavy rainfall in some provinces of Nepal are expected today and tonight, with temperatures ranging from 16.3°C (Jumla) to 38.6°C (Nepalgunj).\n\nBe elaborative as possible.
