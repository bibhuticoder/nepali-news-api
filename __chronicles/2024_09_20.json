Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nAmid opposition from two lawmakers, the Parliamentary Hearing Committee endorsed 16 of the 17 ambassadorial nominees on Thursday.Lawmakers from the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal (JSP-Nepal) and the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) registered their differing views over four nominees—Kapil Shrestha, Netra Prasad Timilsina, Dhan Prasad Pandit, and Shankar Prasad Sharma, ambassadorial nominees for South Africa, Malaysia, Israel, and India, respectively, but the committee endorsed them through a majority vote.Twelve nominees were unanimously endorsed.In his written opposition to the nominations, Dol Prasad Aryal of the RSP mentioned that all four nominees, who faced various allegations during the hearings, should not be appointed as they do not hold the high moral standards set by the constitution.On Shrestha, Aryal pointed to Article 248 (8) of the constitution, which bars former chairpersons and commissioners of the National Human Rights Commission from being appointed to other government positions.Shrestha lacks the high moral ground, said Aryal in his differing opinion registered in the House committee. He argued that such decisions will pave the way for appointing individuals with questionable morality in the future as well.In Pandit’s case, Aryal claimed that he was fined Rs15,000 by a court after Pandit was found hiding information, therefore he should not be appointed as ambassador. Aryal said considering persons of questionable moral conduct for such high-profile appointments would be a violation of the constitution. Similarly, Aryal raised concerns about Timilsina, the ambassadorial nominee for Malaysia, who has an ongoing court case against the government.A complaint was filed against Timilsina in the House committee where he was accused of misusing the letter head of the Nepal Red Cross Society when he was the chairman. But Aryal did not express any reservations about Sharma, who is proposed for India. Lawmakers from both the ruling and opposition parties were divided over the nominations, but consensus could not be reached as Aryal and Adhikari were firm in their opposition.The government had recommended Naresh Bikram Dhakal (Saudi Arabia), Prof Dr Kapilman Shrestha (South Africa), Prof Dhana Prasad Pandit (Israel), Ram Krishna Bhattarai (Sri Lanka), Sanil Nepal (Spain), and Dr Shail Rupakheti (Germany) for ambassadorial positions.Initially, Kanta Rijal was nominated for Australia, but later replaced by Chitra Lekha Yadav. Incumbent Foreign Secretary Sewa Lamsal has been recommended for the European Union and Brussels, but these nominations have yet to be sent to the Parliamentary Hearing Special Committee.Other nominees include Lok Darshan Regmi (USA), Chandra Kumar Ghimire (UK), Shiva Maya Tumbahangphe (South Korea), Junga Bahadur Chauhan (Russia), Ramesh Chandra Poudel (Qatar), Prof Dr Krishna Prasad Oli (China), Dr Sumnima Tuladhar (Denmark), Dr Netra Prasad Timilsina (Malaysia), Prakash Mani Pokhrel (Portugal) and Rita Dhital (Pakistan). Taking exception to the nominations, the hearing committee on September 9 summoned Foreign Minister Arzu Rana and questioned why the government failed to make the appointments inclusive.On July 29, the government had nominated 17 ambassadors and recalled several others. But the nominations were criticised for failing to honour the spirit of inclusiveness.Meanwhile, Prakash Adhikari of the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal (JSP-Nepal) has registered a written objection against Sharma, Timilsina, Shrestha and Pandit stating that Article 282(2) requires ambassadorial appointment to be inclusive. He said current nominations have not accommodated Madhesi, Dalit, Tharu, Muslim and other clusters.On Sharma, Adhikari said that his appointment violates the spirit of the ambassadorial appointment directive of 2075 BS. Aryal of the RSP and Adhikari of the JSP shared similar concerns about three other nominees.The committee postponed the endorsement of Ramkrishna Bhattarai, the proposed ambassador to Sri Lanka, citing unavailability of his bachelor’s degree certificate.“We have instructed him [Bhattarai] to submit the required documents,” said Ishawri Neupane, the chairman of the hearing committee.The government’s nominations have drawn widespread criticism for allegedly neglecting inclusivity and established criteria for such positions. Kanta Rijal, who had been proposed as ambassador to Australia, was recalled due to performance concerns during her previous term in Israel. Subsequently, the government nominated former lawmaker Chitra Lekha Yadav in her place.Ambassadors nominated by the government are appointed by the President after they are endorsed by the parliamentary hearing committee.The nominations were approved with the support of the opposition party, CPN (Maoist Centre). While the Maoist Centre lawmakers on the hearing committee did not object to any of the nominations, they did raise a few questions during the discussions. \nParwati, a bright and social 15-year-old from Lalitpur, enjoyed connecting with friends and meeting new people through social media. But from last year, Parwati, who the Post is identifying with a pseudonym, hasn’t been the same as a result of online grooming and sexual abuse.“Our bubbly girl is no longer so,” said Parwati’s mother. “Although she is taking counselling, she is still soulless.”When she was 14, Parwati got a message from someone posing as a popular teen influencer. He complimented her on her photos and suggested she join an exclusive online group for aspiring models. Flattered by the attention, Parwati began talking to him daily.He gradually coaxed her into sharing private photos, promising that they would stay between them and assuring her that she was special.Slowly, Parwati became withdrawn, spending long hours on her phone and becoming unusually secretive. Her parents dismissed it as typical mood swings that teenagers go through.“If only we hadn’t noticed sooner, things wouldn’t have turned out this way,” says Parwati’s mother.Parwati, too scared to tell them, kept everything to herself, believing she could manage it on her own.It wasn’t until an explicit image of Parwati was leaked online in her school group that her parents finally understood the gravity of the situation. By then, the damage had been done—Parwati had been a victim of grooming and blackmail for nearly a year.Parwati’s experience shows how vulnerable online spaces are for children, who the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child defines as a person below the age of 18.Parwati’s case is not isolated.A research conducted by Voice of Children and KNH Germany in 2023 involving 514 children, families and child protection and juvenile justice stakeholders in Koshi and Bagmati provinces revealed concerning forms of OCSA (Online Child Sexual Abuse).Among the girls in the study, 38.6 percent reported receiving sexual calls and messages, 34.1 percent received inappropriate photos, 13.7 percent encountered indecent links, videos, or images, 6.8 percent were unaware of such occurrences, and 6.8 percent faced other forms of online harassment and exploitation.Among boys, 32.3 percent reported receiving sexual calls and messages, 29.2 percent were sent indecent photos, 15.4 percent received inappropriate links, 16.9 percent were unaware, and 6.2 percent experienced other forms of abuse and exploitation online.The growing incidents of various forms of online child sexual abuse and exploitation is further buttressed by data from the Cyber Bureau.In just under two months of the fiscal year 2024-25, the bureau has recorded 68 cases of cybercrimes involving children, including online sexual abuse.In fiscal year 2023-24, the bureau recorded 635 cases of cyber violence involving children, up from 176 cases in fiscal year 2022-23—for a 260.8 percent rise.Experts say while Nepal has made efforts to address online child sexual abuse, existing laws and frameworks are not being enforced due to limited resources, lack of awareness, and inadequate training.Moreover, parents, caregivers, and children are often unaware of the risks of online abuse, making the current legal framework insufficient to fully address the issue.The recent rise in cybercrime cases involving children can be traced back to the Covid lockdown, when digital platforms became essential for children’s daily education.However, according to Roshani Poudyal, an assistant professor of law at Tribhuvan University and researcher in digital safety, the real issue was lack of proper monitoring of children’s online activities, leaving them exposed to various dangers.“Parents and teachers haven’t done enough on addressing risks online,” Poudyal says.Cyber violence against children is not specific to Nepal—it’s a global problem.At the 28th session of the Human Rights Council in 2015, a report highlighted how new technologies, while offering opportunities, also increase children’s vulnerability to online sexual exploitation.Contrary to the general narrative, while it may seem that only girls are affected by OCSA, boys too are vulnerable, says Poudyal.A 2019 study conducted in the Philippines found that all children, regardless of gender, are at risk online; “boys seeking sexual identity support or accessing pornography are especially vulnerable,” the report said.The huge gap in reporting of online abuse is a problem, as per the research of Voice of Children. Parents hesitate to report such cases due to social stigma, and children often don’t realise they’re being abused. “For example, if someone comments on their picture saying, ‘You’re so beautiful’ or ‘You’re so sexy,’ children might take it as a compliment, unaware of its inappropriate nature, especially if a predator is involved,” Poudyal says.Even if they recognise the abuse, children hesitate to tell their parents. This fear of blame or dismissal usually keeps children silent.The cases of OCSA often being dismissed and unreported adds to the gravity of the issue as, in such cases, there is a higher chance of the impact of OCSA on children going unaddressed, as happened with Parwati who faced continuous abuse for a year.Parwati is still struggling from PTSD and depression, showing how the psychological toll of OCSA can be as severe as offline abuse. The victims often experience self-blame, depression, nightmares, suicidal thoughts and anxiety.Raju Ghimire, deputy director of Voice of the Children, points out that while Nepal has several relevant policies, they are fragmented and lack a dedicated focus on OCSA prevention.The Electronic Transaction Act, 2008 prohibits the dissemination of illicit content online but is insufficient to address online child sexual abuse. These include time limits for filing complaints (35 days), privacy concerns, fair trial issues, and inadequate child protection measures.Even the Act Relating to Children, 2018 fails to define key terms such as child pornography, grooming, sextortion, or cyberstalking, contributing to poor understanding among stakeholders.“The Act is also silent on how to handle cases where the abusers are parents or guardians, and it lacks provisions for alternative shelters for minor victims when family members are perpetrators,” Ghimire says.Not only is there a paucity of special protections for vulnerable groups like children with disabilities or those in the LGBTQIA+ community, the existing act related to children does not address cross-border online child sexual abuse which needs to be covered either by the Act Relating to Children or the Telecommunication Act, 1997.Ghimire says there should be a comprehensive umbrella act with specific provisions addressing OCSA. “This act should define and incorporate various issues related to OCSA,” he says. “There should be a consultative process to amend the Act Relating to Children, 2018 to better cover OCSA.”Ghimire also recommends including a child psychologist in the complaint registration and hearings process to ensure proper support.“The digital world is complex,” Poudyal says. “It is vital for parents, children, and everyone to be sensitised about online sexual abuse and cyberbullying.”She adds that prevention should be prioritised over legal protection after the abuse. She calls for a specific legal framework to improve reporting, response, and investigation mechanisms. “We need better monitoring and regulation of ISPs, clear definitions of various forms of online child abuse, and enhanced digital literacy for children, parents, teachers, and the general public,” she said.“Many people are unaware of what constitutes online sexual abuse or how to address it legally. Awareness programmes in schools and homes are a must. After all, these places are where children spend most of their time.” \nThe government on Thursday organised a concert on the occasion of the ninth Constitutional Day with the stated goal of connecting with the youth.The KP Sharma Oli-led coalition government of the CPN-UML and the Nepali Congress facilitated the National Day Concert for National Unity at Durbar Marg, in front of Narayanhiti Palace at the heart of Kathmandu.Government officials, however, claimed that the concert was mainly organised and run by the public.The government organised the main Constitution Day ceremony at the Army Ground at Khulamanch earlier in the morning.Though the Tundikhel function was the day’s main event, the concert was organised to connect the public, especially youth, with the constitution, according to an official at the prime minister’s secretariat.The official at the prime minister’s secretariat said that coordination with artists was done at the citizen’s level while the government also facilitated the event.At a press conference on September 16, Krishna Hari Pushkar, a secretary at the Prime Minister’s Office, speaking about the function, said, “This time, we are organising a public concert to mark the Constitution Day from the people’s level.”Pushkar added that the concert would make Nepal’s historic journey towards democracy and constitution-making memorable. While officials portrayed the concern as an event organised by the citizens, people looked annoyed by the presence of thousands of security personnel at and around the venue.Officials defended the deployment as a security measure. Thousands of youths participated in the concert carrying the national flag.Prime Minister Oli, in blue jeans and a shiny jacket, attended the event along with his wife, Radhika Shakya, and some ministers including Finance Minister Bishnu Paudel, Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak and Minister for Industry, Commerce and Supply Damodar Bhandari. The concert featured popular artists including Ananda Karki, Kunti Moktan, Devika Bandana, Sugam Pokharel, Deepak Limbu, Pramod Kharel, Subani Moktan, Swapna Suman and renowned bands Kutumba and Elements.In preparation for the concert, vehicles were restricted from Wednesday, causing traffic disruptions at and around Durbar Marg, Putalisadak, Lazimpat, Naxal and other thoroughfares at the city centre. \nThe livestock sector was hit hard by rising feed prices and the contraction of meat consumption last Dashain.This year too, an economic depression and growing joblessness have resulted in a fall in urban household incomes, subduing meat demand. This has affected rural farmers. Lately, however, traders are optimistic about Dashain as they see signs of an economic revival. The 10-day festival begins on October 3.The Kathmandu valley is estimated to have consumed 50,000 to 55,000 goats last Dashain. They estimate the demand in the Valley to surpass 70,000 heads this year, equal to the pre-Covid period.“Nearly 45,000 live goats will be brought by traders at the Kalanki goat market this year,” said Janak Kumar Khadka, president of the Kalanki Khasi Bazaar, one of the oldest livestock markets in Kathmandu.Farmers from different districts also supply goats to Kathmandu, which are estimated to be around 25,000 heads.“We will put extra stalls for farmers who come to sell goats on their own in the market,” said Khadka.The financial situation of farmers has worsened because of an increase in expenditure resulting from a rise in operating costs. Another factor is the slump in the consumption of meat and dairy products. Dairy farmers have not been paid by private and state-owned dairies for months.Economists say consumption has slowed down because people's real incomes have dwindled while urban households' finances are tightened due to growing unemployment, a decrease in real estate and stock prices, and rising cases of fraud in the cooperatives sector.The economic slowdown dampened the festival spirit last year, but traders are quite optimistic this year.While there is no official data on festival spending, economic activity in Nepal peaks during September-November.Some economists estimate that 40 to 70 percent of market activities occur around the three key festivals of Dashain, Tihar and Chhath.It is estimated that many people save throughout the year to spend during these festivals.Business house, bank, and government workers receive bonuses for festivals, and suppliers are keen to capitalise on the increased demand.Last Dashain, the cash crunch forced consumers to cut back on purchases. But this year, banks have sufficient liquidity, and traders are optimistic about sales growth.Traders say that the price of goats, which has already shot up due to the cost of production, will remain stable this Dashain.Animal sacrifices and feast mark the festival, with tens of thousands of animals and birds slaughtered during the country’s biggest festival.Khadka said that as domestic production would be sufficient to meet the Valley's requirements, there would be no imports. “Due to the normal supply trend, prices may remain unchanged at the current market rate.”Live goat prices range from Rs660 to Rs670 per kg in the market.Last Dashain, the price of live goats weighing 20-25 kg was Rs560 per kg, while goats weighing above 25 kg sold for Rs570 a kg. Every Dashain, the Food Management and Trading Company sells goats and mountain goats to check prices that tend to go up on the pretext of festivals.This year, it plans to bring in 1,800 goats and mountain goats.“We have allocated around Rs40 million to buy goats,” said Sharmila Neupane Subedi, information officer at the Food Management and Trading Company. “The budget has been managed from internal sources.”According to the company, goats and mountain goats will arrive at the company’s office on October 3, the day of Ghatasthapana. Goats are mainly supplied from Hetauda and Dang, and mountain goats from Mustang. The animals will be sold from four company outlets in the Valley. The state-run company will also fix the price of goats on Ghatasthapana.“Even though market prices fluctuate, we will set it based on the buying rate,” Subedi said. “But observing the market, I do not think the price will increase.”The company plans to reduce the number of animals, as some died last year for the lack of proper management.Last year, the company supplied 1,659 goats and 542 mountain goats for Dashain. Subedi said around 42 goats died as the livestock was kept in unfavourable weather conditions for long.Most of the goat and mountain goat sales happen on the seventh, eighth and ninth days of Dashain.This year, as the ninth day of Dashain overlaps the eighth, traders said sales will pick up from the seventh day. \nThe Ruby Khan-led Mahila Adhikar Manch—literally, women’s rights forum—has filed a complaint against Banke police and the district attorney at the National Human Rights Commission for their reluctance to lodge cases against Nepali Congress leader Badshah Kurmi.Forteeen protesters have been staging a sit-in at Maitighar in Kathmandu since August 9, demanding Badshah be sacked as a minister from the Lumbini provincial government and lodging a case against him in Banke district court. Though he stepped down as a minister last week following the protest, no cases have been filed against him.Badshah, a Nepali Congress leader and Lumbini provincial assembly member, is the prime accused in Nirmala Kurmi’s disappearance and capture of her property. Nirmala, a resident of Banke district, disappeared mysteriously in 2010 and remains missing.“The chief of Banke police and the district attorney have been creating obstacles for justice by not filing a court case in Nirmala Kurmi's case,” reads the complaint filed by the Manch, urging the commission to take action against them.Banke-based human rights activists have been staging protests regularly for 42 days, demanding to proceed to legal action against the Congress leader. “Badshah had to resign following our protest,” Khan said. “We will not give up unless the case against him reaches the court.”The protesters walk barefoot every day from Kalanki to Maitighar before commencing their indefinite sit-in at Maitighar and walking back. The government has made no overtures for dialogue yet.This is the fourth time they have been in the federal capital demanding justice for Nirmala.The protesters have been claiming that by refusing to implement past deals, successive governments have proved that they are not accountable to the people and not bothered about upholding the rule of law.They first started their protests in October 2021 as a group of 14 people, including 11 women, who arrived in Kathmandu from Nepalgunj, covering over 500 kilometres on foot in the quest for justice for two women victims of murder and disappearances. They had to march to Kathmandu after the local administration paid no attention to their protest.After 12 days of sit-ins and a hunger strike in 2021, the government had agreed to investigate the case of Nirmala, who disappeared mysteriously in 2010. Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba was the prime minister at the time.Badshah is the prime accused in Nirmala’s disappearance and capture of her property. Ignoring the agreement it had signed with Ruby Khan, the Congress fielded Badshah in the provincial assembly elections in November 2023. He won.One and a half years later, on July 23, the country’s biggest party made him a minister in the province. But he had to resign in less than two months.After around three weeks of protest, the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government had reached a five-point deal with Khan in the last week of June. This included completing the investigation of Nirmala’s disappearance without delay.Based on the agreement in October 2021, the government had formed a committee led by Hira Lal Regmi, then a joint-secretary at the home ministry.The committee, in its report submitted to erstwhile minister for home affairs Bal Krishna Khand, had recommended the arrest of, and investigation into, eight people for their alleged involvement in Nirmala’s disappearance.The police arrested seven, who were later released, but they never arrested the Congress leader. Badshah was also a Constituent Assembly member and an influential Congress leader in Banke.With the government’s reluctance to implement the Regmi panel’s recommendations, Khan, accompanied by 15 others, walked to Kathmandu on foot from Banke and started the sit-in in the Capital on November 25, 2021. They withdrew their protest on the 42nd day, after the government agreed to get the Central Investigation Bureau of Nepal Police to investigate Nirmala’s disappearance, implement the home ministry’s probe report and provide security to the protesters.Nirmala, 52, had gone missing in January 2010 from Janaki Rural Municipality in Banke. Her disappearance came to light two years after her two teenage sons were murdered in the span of a week.The constitutional human rights watchdog had in June directed the government to present a progress report on the agreements. The government has ignored the directive by refusing to report to the commission. \nDefending champions and leaders Armed Police Force Club demolished Koshi Province 8-0 to maintain their unbeaten record in the ANFA Women’s League on a crazy high-scoring day that also saw second-placed Tribhuvan Army Club crush Chandrapur 10-0 at the ANFA Complex in Lalitpur on Friday.Rashmi Ghishing was the star of the show for APF with five goals, while Anita KC and Anita Basnet were also on target. The victory also helped the reigning champions preserve their three-point lead at the summit. APF have 19 points from seven games with six victories and a draw. Later in the afternoon, Army pulled off the second biggest victory of the season so far after Chandra Bhandari and Amisha Karki netted hat-tricks against Chandrapur. Dipa Shahi scored a double, while their goalkeeper Anjana Rana Magar also got to the scoresheet scoring a penalty kick. Army also boast the record for the biggest victory of the season so far. They had beaten Sudurpaschim 14-1.At Satdobato, a rampant APF opened the scoring in the 5th minute through KC who tapped in a cross from Ghising.Basnet doubled APF’s lead in the 19th minute scoring a freekick.APF stayed quiet throughout the first half but Ghising had something else in mind and furthered the lead in the 56th minute heading in a cross from Basnet.Basnet added the team’s fourth in the 81st scoring another freekick.Ghising then found the net three times in the space of four minutes late in the game to pull off a huge victory for APF.Ghising now leads the goal scoring chart with nine goals. Waling Municipality’s Jackline Nassali is second in the race with seven goals.Army are bidding to win their first trophy of the women’s league and showed APF they are the true contenders by mauling sixth-placed Chandrapur.Army showed no mercy and took the lead early in the 2nd minute after Hima Chaudhary pounced on a defensive mistake from Sarita Kumari Nath and set up Bhandari to tap into an empty net.It opened the floodgates as Karki added Army’s second in the 28th clinically finishing a pass from Bimala Chaudhary.Dipa Shahi added more salt to Chandarapur wounds in the 32nd minute after goalkeeper Usha Thapa failed to get her hands on a cross from Bimala.Bhandari extended Army’s lead in the 40th taking advantage of a mistake from goalkeeper Thapa. Thapa needlessly deserted her post to unsuccessfully clear a through pass from Karki allowing a confident Bhandari to dribble past her, another chasing defender and slam into the back of the net.Karki then put Army 5-0 in front before the break, beautifully chipping over Chandrapur goalie Thapa.Chandrapur replaced goalkeeper Thapa with Sujata Jhari Magar after the break but it could not stop Army from scoring more.Shahi added Army’s sixth from the penalty seven minutes after the restart after Jhari Magar brought down Bhandari inside the box.Chandrapur conceded another penalty midway into the second half after their captain Saloni Rana Magar handled the ball inside the area. Army goalkeeper Rana Magar took the opportunity to refresh herself after sitting unemployed most of the time at the other end.Karki completed her hat-trick a minute later with a mesmerising finish after good work from Bhandari.Bhandari then added her third and team’s ninth in the 84th minute with a solo effort before Sharmila Thapa completed the statement win two minutes later.The victory gives Army 16 points from seven games.The top five teams at the end of the single-round robin league will progress to the Super League, which will be played in a double round robin format. The top four teams from the Super League will then proceed to the Qualifiers, Eliminator, and Final.Nepal Police Club and Waling Municipality—both on 12 points—will battle for the third spot when they lock horns against each other on Saturday.  \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli left for New York leading Nepal’s delegation to the 79th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) on Friday.The prime minister is accompanied by his spouse Radhika Shakya; Minister for Foreign Affairs Arzu Rana Deuba; Chief Adviser to the prime minister Bishnu Prasad Rimal; Foreign Secretary Sewa Lamsal; and other senior government officials.According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Prime Minister Oli is scheduled to address the General Assembly on September 26. This year’s general debate theme is “Leaving no one behind: Acting together for the advancement of peace, sustainable development, and human dignity for present and future generations.”Oli will also attend the opening session of the general debate on September 24 and a reception hosted by US President Joe Biden on September 25.During his visit, the prime minister will address the Summit of the Future as chair of the Global Coordination Bureau of Least Developed Countries (LDCs). Oli will also participate in the high-level plenary meeting on addressing the existential threats posed by sea-level rise and the high-level meeting on Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR), among other events. In addition to attending the UNGA activities, he is scheduled to deliver a keynote address on “Nepal’s journey to democracy and economic prosperity” at Columbia University on September 23 and speak at the John F Kennedy Jr Forum at Harvard University on “Nepal’s perspective: From transitional justice to climate justice” on September 27.He is scheduled to meet United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres and hold various bilateral meetings on the sidelines of the UNGA.Prime Minister Oli is scheduled to return home on September 30.Meanwhile, President Ramchanda Paudel has entrusted Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Urban Development Prakash Man Singh with the responsibility of overseeing the daily administrative works to be done by the prime minister in the latter’s absence.The President assigned Deputy prime Minister Singh the duty as per the prime minister’s recommendation, the Office of the President said in a statement issued by Shailaja Regmi Bhattarai, spokesperson of the office. \nAs the Nepali Congress chief whip in Parliament, Ramesh Lekhak was among the most vocal advocates for the formation of a parliamentary committee to look into the irregularities in the cooperatives sector, with a particular focus on Gorkha Media Network. This was less than three months ago when the Congress was the main opposition. There had at the time been widespread media reporting on how the network chairman, GB Rai, and Managing Director, Rabi Lamichhane, had been involved in embezzling money from cooperatives and pumping it into the network’s Galaxy 4K television. The matter was urgent as Lamichhane was the serving deputy prime minister and home minister. Credible evidence had surfaced of the home minister trying to suppress police investigation into his personal involvement in the scam. Partly as a result of the relentless pressure from the likes of Lekhak and his party, such a committee indeed came into being on May 28. The same committee has now presented reams of evidence showing how Lamichhane misused money illegally brought into the network from various cooperatives. Lekhak, who has replaced Lamichhane as home minister, now has the chance to walk the talk and implement the recommendations of the parliamentary probe committee he so earnestly championed. Lamichhane and his Rastriya Swatantra Party colleagues rather curiously claim that the party chair has been given a ‘clean cheat’ by the probe committee. Far from it. It has instead held him responsible for the gross misuse of his office of the Gorkha Media Network’s Managing Director. Additionally, the committee has presented clear evidence of how Lamichhane used forged documents to undertake various financial deals while serving as the network’s MD. This is also an untenable premise considering that people in similar positions have been prosecuted. For instance, Gita Basnet, a parliamentarian from the Rastriya Prajatantra Party, is on the run after the police filed a case against her. Basnet was held responsible for misusing the money of Nawalpur-based Chhipchhipe Cooperative, the money which had been invested in a resort she was operating. Interestingly, she was held responsible even though it was not her but her brother-in-law who had brought the money into the organisation. By comparison, the case against Lamichhane is more straightforward. Besides evidence of funds misuse, there is also paper evidence of millions of rupees being deposited into his personal bank account from the account of a cooperative. Legal experts say there is enough evidence to book Lamichhane for cooperative fraud under Cooperative Act, fraud and duping under the National Penal Code, organised crime under the Organised Crime Prevention Act and money laundering under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.This is not a question of exacting revenge against a political opponent, as some RSP leaders have tried to paint the case against Lamichhane. For Home Minister Lekhak and the administration, it is rather a matter of applying the law fairly. The government is already pursuing action against the other individuals who had been accused alongside Lamichhane in the same case. While a diffusion notice has been issued against GB Rai, others are in judicial custody. Lamichhane has thus far been let off the hook because of his political manoeuvrings. Now that the Cabinet has given Lekhakh the green signal to press ahead, he should diligently pursue the case to its end. How he pursues the culprits flagged by the parliamentary committee in the cooperatives scam, including Lamichhane, will define his success or failure as home minister.  \nAristotle emphasized democracy while Socrates criticized sophistry, highlighting the dangers of deceptive rhetoric in democratic systems; modern-day sophistry, known as \"post-truth\" politics, manipulates and controls the political landscape, enabling established parties to maintain power despite corruption and moral transgressions.\nE-commerce giant Amazon has built a reputation as a global company that “delivers at the fastest speeds”. In 2023, it claimed to deliver 7 billion items the same or next day. This record was possible because of thousands of men like Momtaj Mansur from Nepal. In 2021, Mansur was recruited by a labour supply firm to work for Amazon in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. He thought this would be his dream job.What he encountered over the next two years not only shattered that dream but made his life miserable, suffering “harsh (working) conditions at Amazon’s warehouses”. Mansur’s story, which was part of a media investigation, revealed how “major American corporations profit, directly or indirectly, from employment practices that may amount to labour trafficking, which is defined as using force, coercion or fraud to induce someone to work or provide service”.People from Nepal, Bangladesh, India and Myanmar continue to be trafficked to Middle Eastern countries as cheap labour, revealing in many cases that trafficking is marked by either abduction or recruitment from the source countries from where they are transferred through transit regions and end up as victims of exploitation in destination countries.This scenario is one aspect Popular understandings of slavery might recall images of the trans-Atlantic slave trade, which was abolished in the 19th century. However, slavery continues today in new forms that include debt bondage, domestic servitude, forced prostitution, forced labour, forced marriage and human trafficking.In 1999, there were an estimated 27 million people living in modern slavery globally. According to the International Labor Organisation and the Walk Free Foundation, that number rose to 40 million in 2018, and the latest estimate under the Global Slavery Index puts it at 50 million. The people who comprise these figures are hiding in plain sight, often as workers in the informal economy across a wide range of economic sectors.The UN Special Rapporteur on Contemporary Forms of Slavery has listed domestic servitude as one form of modern-day slavery. Domestic or home care work is reported to be the least regulated sector in all regions of the world. Non- or underpayment of wages, long working hours, exploitative working conditions, lack of or limited access to social protection, inability to change employers and tied sponsorship system such as the Kafala system make women, children and migrant workers particularly at risk of domestic servitude.Kafala systemIntroduced in the 1950s, the Kafala system regulates incoming migrant workers in most of the Arab Gulf states. It allows citizens or companies to sponsor a migrant to come and work for them. It ties the migrant workers’ immigration status to their sponsor. They are not allowed to change employers, leave the country or even travel locally without the permission of the sponsor.A sponsor can transfer his sponsorship to another national who is willing to purchase it. This purposeful disenfranchisement of the migrant worker has given rise to modern-day slavery. Workers are denied the right to freedom of association and banned from union membership. Women who leave their employers without “permission” are deemed illegal and face detention or deportation. Such policies dehumanise labour and undermine human rights and fundamental freedoms of migrants.Take the case of Indian national Mythili Ezhumalai, who was found unconscious in her Kuwaiti employer’s house in December 2023. She was allegedly forced to work more than 18 hours a day, which caused immobility to her left arm. Later, she suffered a heart attack.While trafficking continues to negatively impact millions of South Asians, especially those from India, Nepal and Bangladesh, there have been reports of egregious forms of human rights violations in the Gulf countries as thousands of women from these countries are allegedly sold every year in slave markets in the Middle East.In 2015, media reports revealed that New Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata were “transit points for these sex traffickers” and that the perpetrators included airlines and immigration officials. Two years later, the Uttarakhand police exposed a trafficking case involving six Nepalese women who were to be taken to the Gulf to work as domestic helpers. In June 2017, the police rescued rescued 16 Nepalese women at the India-Nepal border while they were being trafficked to India.The human rights violations that these women experience in destination countries remain invisible, as their servitude is confined within the private space of their employers’ homes. Domestic workers are not protected by labour laws in any of these countries. As a result, they can become trapped in modern-day slavery and face multiple barriers to accessing justice.Online slave marketsThere is a new dimension to this transnational problem.In 2019, a BBC undercover investigation revealed the prevalence of online markets where migrant domestic workers would be bought and sold on various social media apps. A huge number of photographs of such unfortunate women—along with their racial profiles—were displayed. Hashtagged posts would accompany sales settled through private messages.The sellers advised confiscating the women’s passports, confining them to the house, denying them any time off and giving them little or no access to a phone. This transaction was seen as a means to make profit by the employers. They could buy a maid for 600 Kuwaiti dirham (approx $US1,970) and sell her for 1,000 dirham ($US3,280). This online sale bypassed the recruitment agencies and created an unregulated black market, which made women more vulnerable to abuse and exploitation.Despite assurances from Facebook, Google and Apple that the offending hashtags would be removed and they would work with app developers to prevent illegal activity, the Centre for International Policy’s data on Global Social Media Harms published in 2023 again uncovered slave markets on social media.While UN Sustainable Development Goal 8.7 aims to do away with modern-day slavery, practical policy and practice measures, rather than ideological confrontation, will ensure better outcomes. Most Gulf countries have not taken easily to demands for abolishing the Kafala system, while some have signed bilateral agreements with provider countries.Saudi Arabia and the Philippines signed a bilateral agreement in 2013 that contained specific joint regulation of private employment agencies. India signed a mobility agreement with Saudi Arabia in 2014, and Kuwait in 2018 started recruitment of Indian domestic workers through government agencies. Such agreements could give some degree of protection to migrant domestic workers if they lay down provisions pertaining to minimum working age, working hours, transfer of salaries through designated bank accounts, holidays, right to association and bringing domestic work under labour laws.Eliminating online slave markets should be top priority for not only Gulf countries but also provider states. The app companies should be held liable if national regulation was to hold them accountable. Legislation ought to be designed to regulate social media companies. Banning migration of unskilled women under the age of 30 to 18 countries identified with history of labour exploitation and abuses merely pushes them to grey channels, depriving them of protective measures.The main way for provider countries to protect female domestic workers is simply to ban their mobility. However, a 2023 report shows that international migration leads to an enormous jump in income. So, instead of depriving South Asian women of this opportunity, states could draft policies of protection and empowerment.—360info \nNepal's ninth Constitution Day is marked with celebrations and protests, as Madhesh-based parties express grievances and demand amendments.\nNepal Army team participated in Sagarmatha Friendship exercise with China, while Pacific Angel exercise with the United States concluded, enhancing disaster management capabilities.\nParliamentary Hearing Committee seeks public complaints against proposed Chief Justice and two ambassadorial nominees in line with constitutional requirement.\nIsraeli warplanes carried out late on Thursday their most intense strikes on southern Lebanon in nearly a year of war, heightening the conflict between Israel and Lebanese armed group Hezbollah amid calls for restraint.The White House said a diplomatic solution was achievable and urgent, and Britain called for an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. The US is “afraid and concerned about potential escalation,” White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre told a briefing. The intense barrage followed attacks earlier in the week attributed by Lebanon and Hezbollah to Israel that blew up Hezbollah radios and pagers, killing 37 people and wounding about 3,000 in Lebanon. In Thursday's late operation, Israel's military said its jets over two hours struck hundreds of multiple-rocket-launcher barrels in southern Lebanon that were set to be fired immediately toward Israel. The bombardment included more than 52 strikes across southern Lebanon after 9 p.m. (1800 GMT), Lebanon's state news agency NNA said. Three Lebanese security sources said these were the heaviest aerial strikes since the conflict began in October. There were no immediate reports of casualties. Israel's military vowed to continue to attack Hezbollah and said its strikes throughout Thursday hit about 100 rocket launchers plus other targets in southern Lebanon. In a TV address on Thursday, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said the device explosions on Tuesday and Wednesday “crossed all red lines.” “The enemy went beyond all controls, laws and morals,” he said, adding the attacks “could be considered war crimes or a declaration of war.” Israel has not directly commented on the pager and radio detonations, which security sources say were probably carried out by its Mossad spy agency, which has a long history of carrying out sophisticated attacks on foreign soil. The Lebanese mission to the U.N. said in a letter to the Security Council on Thursday that Israel was responsible for detonating the devices via electronic messages and explosives implanted in them before they arrived in Lebanon, in line with theories that have circulated since the explosions. The 15-member Security Council is due to meet on Friday over the blasts. Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati called on the Security Council to take a firm stand to stop Israel's “aggression” and “technological war.” ISRAEL VOWS HEZBOLLAH TO PAY ‘INCREASING PRICE’ As Nasrallah's broadcast aired, deafening sonic booms from Israeli warplanes shook Beirut, a sound that has become common in recent months but has taken on greater significance as the threat of all-out war has ramped up. Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said late on Thursday that Israel will keep up military action against Hezbollah. “In the new phase of the war there are significant opportunities but also significant risks. Hezbollah feels that it is being persecuted and the sequence of military actions will continue,” Gallant said in a statement. “Our goal is to ensure the safe return of Israel's northern communities to their homes. As time goes by, Hezbollah will pay an increasing price,” Gallant said. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened his close circle of ministers for consultations, Israel's Channel 13 News reported. Two Israeli soldiers were killed in combat on Thursday in Israel's north, the Israeli military said. ‘BIG HARSH BLOW’ Hezbollah fired missiles at Israel the day after the Oct. 7 cross-border attack by the Palestinian militant group Hamas which triggered the Gaza war. Since then, constant exchanges of fire have occurred. Although neither side has allowed this to escalate into full-scale war, it has led to the evacuation of tens of thousands of people from the border area on both sides. Nasrallah said Hezbollah hoped Israeli troops would enter southern Lebanon because that would create a “historic opportunity” for the Iran-backed group. No military escalation, killing, assassinations or all-out war would return Israeli residents to the border area, he added. Israel will face “a crushing response from the axis of resistance,” Iran's Revolutionary Guards Commander Hossein Salami told Nasrallah on Thursday, according to state media, referring to a coalition of Iran-aligned militant groups including Hezbollah, Yemen's Houthis, Hamas and armed groups in Iraq and Syria. Speaking in Paris, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged restraint, adding he did not want to see escalatory actions by any party that make a Gaza ceasefire deal more difficult. The attacks on Hezbollah communications equipment sowed fear across Lebanon, with people abandoning electronic devices for fear of carrying bombs in their pockets. Nasrallah said thousands of pagers had been targeted simultaneously, with some of the explosions happening in hospitals, pharmacies, markets, shops, and streets busy with civilians, women, and children. Israel says its conflict with Hezbollah, like its war in Gaza against Hamas, is part of a wider regional confrontation with Iran, which sponsors both groups as well as armed movements in Syria, Yemen, and Iraq. Israel has been accused of assassinations including a blast in Tehran that killed the leader of Hamas and another in a Beirut suburb that killed a senior Hezbollah commander within hours of each other in July.   \nScarred by a decades-long civil war and struggling to survive in Sri Lanka’s crippled economy, ethnic minority Tamils in the island nation say they have little hope that Saturday's presidential election will improve their lot by much.Tamils form 12% of the country’s 22 million population but have long been electorally sidelined, as most candidates belong to the majority Sinhala population and many Tamils say they have no hope of a better future from those candidates.A 26-year civil war between Tamil insurgents, who wanted a separate Tamil nation in the north and east of the country, and government forces ended in 2009. Rights groups accuse both sides of abuses during the conflict in which 40,000 people died, according to UN estimates.“After we recovered from the losses that we faced during the war, we faced the Coronavirus pandemic and the economic crisis ... I don’t have any hope,” Paramasamy Thanabalasingam, a 62-year-old fisherman in Jaffna, capital of the Northern Province, told Reuters.Sri Lanka voted on Saturday to elect a new president for a five-year term, the first election since a severe shortfall of dollar reserves pushed the South Asian island into its worst financial freefall in decades.Traditionally, Tamils have voted for Tamil parties which are active in northern Sri Lanka, but Thanabalasingam says their vote is now split among many factions which claim to represent the minority’s concerns.“As of now, only a Sinhala candidate can be a president, there is a Tamil candidate as well but our Tamil politicians are split in several ways,” he said.“The decision (of who will be president) will be made by the majority Sinhala people, that is why I feel there won’t be any change,” he said.President Ranil Wickremesinghe, a Sinhalese standing for the first time as an independent candidate, is among the 38 candidates contesting Sri Lanka’s presidential election on Saturday. The election is shaping to be a close race between Wickremesinghe, opposition leader Sajith Premadasa, and Marxist-leaning politician Anura Kumara Dissanayake.Thanabalasingam says he and his family were displaced during the civil war, and the COVID-19 pandemic coupled with Sri Lanka's economic crisis has worsened their condition.Muththu Sivamohan, 66, secretary of a farmers’ union in Iranaimadhu, also in the Northern Province, said most Tamil farmers are slowly recovering from the 2022 economic collapse but are deep in debt due to expenses incurred during the crisis.“There has been no economic development in recent years,” he said. “We are of the view that there has to be a change in the government to put an end to the corruption culture.”“At the same time, we cannot compromise on our rights for the sake of development. That’s why we decided to support the Tamil candidate as our first choice,” he said. \nStriking junior doctors in India’s West Bengal state agreed to resume essential services, in a partial resumption of medical facilities, but they will continue their strike over the rape and murder of a colleague over a month ago.The rape and murder of the 31-year-old female doctor in West Bengal in August set off a wave of protests by doctors demanding greater workplace safety for women and justice for their slain colleague, prompting India’s Supreme Court to create a hospital safety task force.The junior doctors will resume essential duties from Saturday, the West Bengal Junior Doctors’ Front, which represents about 7,000 physicians in the state, said in a statement on Thursday.“The movement for “justice” will continue in each state-run hospital but we have decided to resume essential services in hospitals due to the flood situation in parts of the state,” Aniket Mahato of the West Bengal Junior Doctors’ Front said.Doctors are demanding better security, included additional CCTV coverage, deployment of female security personnel, adequate lighting, toilets, and resting spaces.A police volunteer has been arrested in connection the doctor”s rape and death in the R.G. Kar Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata city, the former principal of the college has been arrested over accusations of evidence tampering and graft, and the police chief of capital Kolkata has been replaced.Although tougher laws were introduced after the 2012 gruesome gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old student in national capital New Delhi, activists say the Kolkata case shows how women in the country continue to suffer from sexual violence. \nThe mpox outbreak in Africa is still not under control, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) warned on Thursday, adding that cases were still increasing in several countries.The World Health Organization declared the recent outbreak of the disease a public health emergency of international concern after the new variant was identified.Countries in the continent are struggling to respond to another major outbreak coming at the heels of the COVID-19 pandemic that exposed weak health systems that were unprepared to deal with a major public health crisis.The number of mpox cases in Africa has surged 177%, and deaths have increased 38.5% compared with the same period a year ago, data from the Africa CDC showed.“We can say today that mpox is not under control in Africa. We still have this increase of cases that is worrying for all of us,” Jean Kaseya, director general of Africa CDC, told a weekly briefing on the outbreak.In one week 2,912 new cases were reported compared with the previous week including a new country, Morocco, where a case was reported, confirming the spread of the disease in all four regions of the continent.So far, 15 of the 55 member states of the African Union have reported cases, Africa CDC said.“We still have people dying from mpox in Africa. In one week, we lost 14 people,” Kaseya added.He added in some countries, such as Cameroon and the Democratic Republic of Congo, two strains of the disease were in circulation, but because surveillance and testing systems were not robust enough, it was impossible to tell if that was the case in other countries.Kaseya said Rwanda had started its vaccination campaign, while the Democratic Republic of Congo, the epicentre of the outbreak, is set to start vaccinations in early October. \nToday the weather is forecast to be partly to generally cloudy throughout the country.Koshi, Bagmati and Karnali Province and a few places in Gandaki Province and one or two places of the rest of the country are likely to experience light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning.Tonight the weather will be partly to generally cloudy throughout the country. Light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is likely to occur at some places of the hilly region of Bagmati and Gandaki Province and at one or two parts of the hilly regions of the rest of the province.On Thursday Janakpur recorded the highest temperature at 38.8°C, and Jomsom recorded the lowest at 10.5°C.  \nJackline Nassali scored a hat-trick as Waling Municipality thumped Bagmati Youth Club 4-0 to climb to the fourth position in the ANFA Women’s League on Thursday.Cissy Nantongo also netted for Waling at the ANFA Complex as the victory moved them level with third-placed Nepal Police Club. Both Waling and Police have 12 points but Police sit third due to superior goal difference.For Bagmati, it has proved a false dawn after opening the women’s league with a 5-1 thrashing of Sudurpaschim Province. It remains Bagmati’s only victory of the season. They have lost four and drawn one since and sit miserably in the eighth position with four points.Waling lost their opening match against Koshi Province 4-0 but have remarkably revived their season with four victories, thanks to their Ugandan signings Nassali, Nantongo and Viola Namuddu.Their Ugandan players have now scored 12 of their 15 goals this season.It was Nassali’s second hat-trick for Waling after also finding the net three times against Karnali Province.To her name, Namaddu also has a hat-trick, which came against Sudurpaschim.Nantongo, who also scored a goal in Waling’s 2-1 loss against defending champions Armed Police Force Club, opened the scoring in the 22nd minute, beautifully placing a rebound after her freekick hit the bar first.It was all Nassali after that.Nassali doubled Waling’s lead in the 41st minute with a powerful shot. Sukriya Miya was the creator of the opportunity as her shot hit the upright and returned back. The lazy Bagmati defenders failed to clear the rebound, allowing Nassali to slam home a left-footed strike.Nassali furthered Waling’s lead in the 54th minute tapping in a rebound after Bagmati goalkeeper Sujata Tamang failed to grab her header.Nassali then completed a comfortable victory from close range in the 83rd minute converting a pass from Sushma Tamang. \nDrinking water used by Kathmandu and Lalitpur metropolitan city residents for drinking has been found contaminated with deadly microbes.According to officials at the Lalitpur Metropolitan City, 180 of 540 water samples collected from wards 7, 8, 9, 15, and 17 of the metropolis were found contaminated with faecal coliform.Similarly, of 506 samples of drinking water collected from wards 11, 12, and 13 of Kathmandu Metropolitan City, 98 were contaminated with faecal coliform.The presence of faecal coliform, a microscopic organism that thrives in the intestines of warm-blooded animals or their faeces, indicates sewage contamination in the drinking water, according to doctors.Officials at the Health Office Lalitpur have reported the presence of deadly microbes in all water samples, including those from the water utility and well water of the areas that saw cholera outbreaks this year.“Faecal coliform has been detected in all water samples from the cholera-hit areas,” said Shree Bhadra Sharma, a lab technician at the Health Office Lalitpur. In July, officials had confirmed a cholera outbreak in Thaiba area in Godawari Municipality of Lalitpur.“Water samples collected from other areas too have been found problematic,” Sharma said.Of 81 people who tested positive for cholera in various districts nationwide in the ongoing monsoon season, 53 were from Lalitpur districts. Health authorities say they had launched an awareness campaign and chlorinated the drinking water to tackle the contamination.Kathmandu reported 12 cases of cholera infection during the period.Cholera is a highly infectious disease that causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting, which in turn results in dehydration and can lead to death within a few hours if left untreated. The World Health Organisation says cholera is a global threat to public health and an indicator of inequality and a lack of social development.Health officials said that the Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool sample of an infected patient. They say even jar water, widely considered safer than water from other sources, has been contaminated with faecal coliform.Doctors say this is not the first time that the water used by people in the Valley was found contaminated with potentially deadly microbes. What concerns them more is that water quality has not improved significantly.“Consumption of water contaminated with human faeces causes diarrheal infections,” said Dr Arjun Sapkota, chief of the Health Office, Kathmandu. “We have launched an awareness drive in the areas where cholera cases were detected, and water samples were found to be contaminated with deadly microbes.”Doctors say consumption of contaminated water not only causes diarrheal infections and cholera but also increases the chances of contracting dysentery, typhoid, and hepatitis A and E.Initiating awareness drives and ensuring safe drinking water are the only ways to save people from water-borne diseases, according to them. A combination of careful surveys, provision of safe drinking water, good sanitation and hygiene standards, social mobilisation and treatment are required to contain the spread of infection, they say. \n\nOn September 1, on the final day of the Nepali Congress Central Working Committee meeting, General Secretary Bishwa Prakash Sharma explicitly urged Sher Bahadur Deuba, the party president, to give up his aspirations to be the prime minister yet again.As per the seven-point agreement between the Congress and the CPN-UML on July 1, UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli, the incumbent prime minister, will lead the government for the first two years. Then Congress chief Deuba will lead the government until the elections in November-December 2027. Sharma urged Deuba to leave the prime minister’s post for another senior Congress leader. Deuba reportedly rejected the proposal outright.“I will not give up the position just because someone so desires,” Deuba reportedly said in response.Sharma, one of the two general secretaries of the country’s oldest political party, had proposed an exit policy in his contemporary political proposal tabled at the Mahasamiti meeting in February for the leaders holding state positions such as president, prime minister, ministers.Besides Sharma's proposal, the Mahasamiti also endorsed the papers submitted by Vice-president Purna Bahadur Khadka and General Secretary Gagan Thapa. However, it also gave room for the central committee to modify the proposal. When the central committee approved Khadka’s policy proposal and Thapa’s organisational proposal with minor changes, Sharma’s paper was pushed back to be considered while amending the national constitution.Sharma proposed one term for the [country’s] President, two terms for the prime minister, three terms for ministers, and four terms for lawmakers. Sharma’s proposal on term limits on persons serving as the country’s president or the prime minister is a national rather than the party’s issue, so it has been deferred, according to party leaders. Most of the Congress central leaders who spoke at the meeting, which lasted almost a month with gaps in between, claimed that fixing a time limit for the leadership was contrary to the democratic principle that the party champions.UML chief whip Mahesh Bartaula also says that since politics is a voluntary job, the politicians should be able to contribute to the society for as long as they want. “Nonetheless, the exit policy proposal is thought-provoking,” Bartaula told the Post. As a new generation of leaders is yet to be fully developed, the public still trusts the older crop of leaders, he argues. “Those vying for top positions are yet to gain the public’s credibility.”For Krishna Pokharel, a professor of political science, it would be unnatural to amend the constitution to address Sharma’s demand. “In countries where people directly elect their prime minister, amending the constitution to limit the executive head’s term could be reasonable” Pokharel told the Post. “However, in a country like Nepal where the parties choose the prime minister, exit policy should rather be mentioned in the party’s statute.” Had Nepali leaders internalised the spirit of the parliamentary system, their entry and exit points need not have been discussed. “The parliamentary system in Nepal has been vulgarised,” Pokharel added. According to political experts, despite the Congress leaders criticising the exit policy at the central committee, the proposal’s public appeal is growing. They see no alternative to its implementation, sooner or later. One reason for growing public disenchantment with political parties is that the same old faces have continued in leadership positions for a long time. If there were a term limit for a leader in a governmental or party position, people’s dissatisfaction would somehow be addressed.Experts say the recent political upheaval in Bangladesh and the political crisis of Sri Lanka two years ago were due to the continuous rule by a single person or a single family.One reason some democracies struggle is their political leaders’ unlimited hunger for power, Uddab Pyakurel, a political analyst, told the Post. “In Nordic countries, there is no need to set term limits for leaders as there is already a strong democratic culture there.” Despite having leaders like Donald Trump, American democracy still works, partly because of the term limits, Pyakurel reasoned. “If Nepal is to strengthen its democratic system, it must implement the exit policy for political leaders,” he said. Some political experts see problems even after introducing a term limit.Arguing that limiting the tenure for top positions alone is not enough to put curbs on autocratic tendencies, Khagendra Prasai, another political analyst, said: “The major issue is developing political mannerism and culture.”Calls for the top party leadership making way for a new generation are growing not just in the Congress. Even during the CPN (Maoist Centre) standing committee meeting last month, Deputy General Secretary Janardan Sharma questioned Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s uninterrupted leadership for nearly 35 years. Sharma even urged Dahal to resign the position. Experts say leaders with limited terms realise they must get a lot done within the given time at the top. There is no slow cooldown period. The current set of top party leaders—Deuba, Oli and Dahal in particular—have been in power for two or three decades, repeatedly assuming the country’s top executive position. Article 216 (7) of the Constitution of Nepal says a person elected mayor for two terms will not be eligible to be a candidate in future municipal elections. Article 215 (7) has a similar provision for chairpersons of rural municipalities.The constitution also has a two-term limit for President.While all other top governing posts come with fixed terms, there are limits on how many times the prime minister, chief ministers, ministers, and lawmakers can serve. This allows politicians to occupy office for as long as they choose, preventing the leadership handover to the next generation. In the view of Mighendra Bahadur Karki, executive director of the Centre for Nepal and Asia Studies (CNAS) at Tribhuvan University: “Leaders who know that their peers, even junior colleagues, may someday be their supervisors may be more thoughtful of their behaviour. Poor behaviour and status anxiety might be reduced, increasing the room for collaboration.” If senior leaders know that they need to bow out of the government or the party after a particular time, they are more likely to train and promote junior leaders to take their place, Karki told the Post. “This in turn will cultivate a healthy political culture.”But he warned that the question of term limit is not straightforward. “The exit policy, if it is to be implemented, should be system-centric rather than targeting particular leaders.” \nEven in the era of the meteoric rise of ultra-right politics globally, Nepal is among a few countries whose politics is dominated by socialists of different shades. From democratic socialists to moderate Leftists to Marxists and Bolsheviks to Bolivarans, all dream of establishing a classless society under a single-party dictatorship. Not being a socialist in this country is a political sacrilege and, ostensibly, becoming anti-development, if not outrightly anti-national. Nevertheless, almost all of these pipe dreamers have accepted the “mainstream” adult franchise-based parliamentary democracy.Not being socialist also (perhaps) goes against the Constitution. This is because, in at least three instances, The Constitution of Nepal 2015 categorically mentions the term “socialism” while defining the nature of the Nepali state. The preamble states that the constitution was issued as its formulator, the Constituent Assembly, was “committed to socialism”. Article 4(1) defines the State of Nepal as “an independent, indivisible, sovereign, secular, inclusive, democratic, socialism-oriented, federal democratic republican state”. Under the Directive Principles (Article 50, Clause 3), the objective of the State is “to develop a socialism-oriented independent and prosperous economy.” Tragically, the constitution has skipped the definition of the term “socialism”, making it a paradise for the interpretation of convenience.Political stunts often resurface to save socialism from falling from grace. When Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the chairman of the CPN (Maoist Centre), was prime minister, he formed a socialist front last January, including three other left parties—Janata Samajbadi Party, CPN (Unified Socialist) and CPN (Biplov). Now out of power, Dahal is trying to bring other fringe parties into the fold for a more organised opposition to the current government. There have been several efforts in history to unite the so-called socialists. But in practice, opportunism has homogenised Nepal’s every political outfit into a power-hungry brute force without principle, let alone ideology. The travesty, however, is that the fundamental allegation to demean one party by the other, mainly among the communist parties, is “the blatant abandonment of the principles of socialism.”Outdated narrativesSocialism takes refuge in utterly outdated socioeconomics and ecopolitical narratives for its survival. The overarching prescription is that the state must not only provide free health and education but also reduce the private sector’s role in the economy. The constitution includes free education up to the secondary level, free basic health care and gainful employment as fundamental rights. The socialists see all economic and political ills as the outcome of engulfing trends of liberalisation and globalisation. They still advocate for land reform that ensures entitlement of the “land to the tiller”. However, in reality, the younger generation is unwilling to own farms as they are moving away from agriculture to modern sectors of employment and entrepreneurship. Huge amounts of fertile land are increasingly being left uncultivated for want of people opting for farming. Besides, the unplanned drive of land fragmentation has converted entire farmlands into unfeasible patches for commercial-scale production of agricultural products. Failed land use planning and haphazard urbanisation have further eroded the prospects of the land used for agriculture.The pro-socialist crusade may not have appeared vocal to stop the privatisation of highly loss-making state-owned enterprises, stall private sector economic reforms and discontinue the centralised planning process, but they have crept into every aspect of economic policy-making. As a result, the economy is persistently left without a development model, and growth has stagnated beyond endurance. Nepal’s market integration with even the regional market is very limited, and the economy, seemingly irreversibly, becomes import-dependent, draining out capital and young brains.RamificationsThe discourse itself is anachronistic. The political parties are not competing to be forward-looking and pro-reform but to prove themselves purer socialists than others. This is rapidly disconnecting the political parties from the political system the country has adopted at a great opportunity cost and from the economic system that must generate output to increase public well-being.Philosophically, socialism with intended control of the state is the opposite pole to federalism, which seeks to devolve political and economic power closer to the masses. But most of Nepal’s political parties are playing devout socialists and ardent federalists. So, it is no surprise that federalism has been able to produce only suboptimal results during the last seven years of its implementation. The subnational political and administrative units created akin to the federal setup for all practical purposes remain subservient to the power concentrated at the centre. The concept of the controlling “central” government is finding it hard to convert into a coordinating “federal” government.The socialist idea of every facility being financed by the state certainly looks benign on the surface. This simply means the state treasury has to be adequately filled and continuously replenished to fulfil all existing public demands for services and facilities and be enough to meet future aspirations for improved quality of life. Without a reliable revenue source, the state can neither finance better public delivery nor develop infrastructure for the future. Nepal is now exactly in this trap.The real paradox of the socialist model of state-managed economy lies exactly here. Revenue on a convincing scale can only be generated if private sector investment substantially increases productivity, profit, employment and personal income. The state financing everything, even if it becomes a basic right included in the constitution, is impossible without making the market economy sizable, vibrant and capable of paying taxes. Such a market is impossible to imagine without unhindered private sector investment. Foreign investment is the new paradigm in the economies with comparative advantage. However, the very idea of a state-controlled socialist economy is perhaps enough to turn the heads of foreign investors away from the economy in question.Even Karl Marx’s Das Kapital advocated for the highest level of capital growth for extreme exploitation to explode into revolution. However, Nepali socialists didn't even recognise the importance of the inevitable expansion of capital for a state. The state apparatus has evolved since Marx to prevent extreme exploitation. Also, capitalists need not be exterminated by violence but can be constructively made liable to duly paying tax to the state.   \nMaya, a 36-year-old single mother from Babarmahal, Kathmandu never imagined that a polite rejection on Facebook two months ago would spiral into a living nightmare.Maya (her real name has been changed to protect her identity) became the target of an online stalker after she rejected a man’s advances. What started as a few friendly messages on social media quickly took a dark turn when the man demanded nude photos of her, which she refused to send.Unfazed, he started sending her unsolicited explicit images of himself. He then began tracking her online activity, leaving threatening messages, and eventually, he found her home address. “I would receive messages saying he was watching me, that he knew where my son went to school,” Maya told the Post. Despite blocking him multiple times, the stalker always found a way to reappear, using different accounts to harass her. Fearing for her nine-year-old son’s safety, she finally mustered the courage to file a complaint with the Cyber Bureau of Nepal Police 15 days ago.Since informing the stalker that she had taken legal action, he has not contacted her again, but the experience has left her feeling paranoid and anxious. She now fears leaving her home and hesitates to go online. “I just want to feel safe again, but I’m not sure if that’s possible anymore,” Maya says.Maya’s ordeal speaks volumes about how violence against women is no longer confined to physical spaces but has increasingly infiltrated the digital world in the form of online abuse, from revenge porn and bullying to sexual harassment, trolling, fraud, and blackmail.The severity of this issue becomes even clearer with data from the Cyber Bureau. In just under two months of the fiscal year 2024-25, the bureau has already recorded 882 cases of cybercrimes involving women. Looking back at previous years, the figures paint a troubling picture. In the fiscal year 2022-23, there were 9,013 reported cybercrime cases, with 4,590 filed by women. The period also saw 130 cases involving minor girls. The following year, 2023-24, witnessed a dramatic rise in the number of cases involving women to 8,745 and those involving minors to 382. This represents an increase of approximately 90.52 percent in cyber violence cases reported by women from 2022-23 to 2023-24.As the country entered a new fiscal year, the trend of online violence continues, with the bureau already reporting 35 cases involving minor girls and 882 cases involving adult women. However, these numbers alone do not capture the full extent of women’s and girls’ vulnerability in the digital space. Traditional beliefs, discrimination, and the normalisation of such behaviour, along with the fear that exposing abuse will shame them and their families, often lead to many cases going unreported.Rita, a 27-year-old woman, from Sunsari whom the Post is identifying with a pseudonym, is one such victim. She never imagined that a relationship she once cherished would end up destroying her life. After a difficult breakup, her ex-partner with whom she had a live-in relationship, sought revenge by sharing intimate videos and photos of her online with her family, friends, and relatives in 2022.For the next six months, her ex continued to sexually harass her through social media. The abuse only ceased after she attempted suicide, which resulted in a three-week hospitalisation.“Even after all this happened, my family refused to help me file a complaint. My relatives even mocked me, saying that I had already done intimate things during the live-in relationship. They said he wasn’t physically hurting or abusing me, so I should just get over it”, says Rita.According to a UN report based on studies in 10 countries, an estimated 95 percent of aggressive behaviour, harassment, abusive language, and degrading images online are directed at women, and they often come from partners or ex-partners.A year has passed for Rita, but the emotional scars remain, and she continues to struggle with depression.Many in Nepal, like Rita’s relatives, downplay the impact of online harassment, dismissing it as “just virtual, not physical.” However, a UN report titled ‘Combating Online Violence Against Women & Girls: A Worldwide Wake-Up Call,’ published by the UN Broadband Commission in 2015, tells a different story. It argues that ‘cyber touch’ can be as damaging as physical touch, suggesting that online abuse can be as bad as domestic violence or sexual assault.Now, as women across Nepal are celebrating Teej, many find themselves facing online violence. They are subjected to a barrage of hate speech simply for enjoying themselves.In recent years, the sight of women dancing, singing, drinking, and celebrating during Teej has sparked outrage among certain segments of society, particularly men who see these activities as a challenge to traditional gender roles. Social media trolls have seized on the opportunity to attack and criticise what they consider ‘inappropriate behaviour, clothing, and dance.’“Every year, it’s the same story,” says Ankita Chapagain, a 40-year-old from Kathmandu. “As soon as videos of women enjoying Teej and dancing go online, the hate comments start pouring in. We’re called names, our morals are questioned, and we’re blamed for the supposed degradation of society.”This animosity extends beyond anonymous trolls; it mirrors a deeper social unease with women’s independence and the pervasive misogyny and patriarchy in our culture. “It’s as if they can’t stand to see women happy and celebrating on their own terms,” Chapagain adds.The problem intensifies during elections, with female politicians facing significant online abuse. An analysis conducted by Panos South Asia reveals that insults and hate speech are the most common attacks on female politicians.A joint statement by the United Nations Special Rapporteurs on Violence against Women and Freedom of Expression says online violence against women can “chill and disrupt the online participation of women journalists, activists, human rights defenders, artists, and other public figures and private individuals” —which underscores the severe impact of growing cyber violence.So, how well-prepared are the institutions responsible for addressing this issue, like the Cyber Bureau? The answer seems to be, not very well.Superintendent of Police Deepak Raj Awasthi, spokesperson, and information officer of the Cyber Bureau, told the Post last month that the bureau is struggling with both understaffing and underfunding.The gap between the rise in cybercrimes and the lack of resources leaves the virtual realm a dangerous space, especially for girls and women who are already vulnerable due to unsafe physical environments, pervasive misogyny, and systemic discrimination. \nRae was the envoy to Kathmandu during the promulgation of the 2015 constitution and the subsequent blockade. In this conversation, Rae talks about the evolution of Nepal-India ties since the blockade, regional geopolitics, what the two countries get wrong about each other, how New Delhi views Nepali communist parties and the governments they lead, and the change (if any) in India’s neighbourhood policy since the start of Narendra Modi’s third term in office. \nKunwar has been the MD for just under three years. Before coming back to her homeland to join Daraz Nepal, she worked at different American companies, including Amazon, the world’s biggest e-commerce platform. In this conversation, Kunwar talks about the opportunities and challenges of running an e-commerce enterprise in Nepal, as well as the country’s overall business environment.  \nWhen the Ranjitkar group was established, they discovered this forgotten dance and devoted two years to researching it.Now, they are reintroducing it during Indra Jatra by training the new generation in this traditional art form. \nHe is known for his nationalist legacy, marked by the amendment of Nepal's map to include territories like Kalapani, Lipulekh, and Limpiyadhura, and his strong stance against India, especially during and after the 2015 Nepal blockade.But how did he rise to become the country's powerful man? \nTanka Chaulagain is a theatre artist, writer, and director. He has directed various plays, such as ‘Romeo and Juliet’, ‘Charlie and the Chocolate Factory’, and ‘Matilda’. Chaulagain is also the founder of ‘Lalabala’, an acting platform for children. He has also authored several books, such as ‘Kathmandu Geet’, ‘Taalatuli’, and ‘Ubadkhaabad’.In this conversation with the Post’s Rishika Dhakal, Chaulagain discusses his newly published book ‘Rudane’. What is your recent book about?My latest book is based on the life of Rup Chandra Bista, a well-known political figure. It's a mix of biography and fiction. Since the book is autobiographical fiction, some readers have asked why I chose to fictionalise Bista’s life instead of writing a straightforward biography. As someone with a background in theatre and drama, I was drawn to the dramatic elements of his journey. While biography is bound by facts, which anyone can research and present, fiction allows me to explore, be creative, and let my imagination shape the narrative. This approach makes the story more engaging, so I opted for a fictionalised account of Rup Chandra Bista’s life.While writing fiction, there’s a concern that the emotional elements might overshadow the historical facts, potentially erasing them. So, how have you balanced these aspects to avoid distorting history?I was aware of the challenge this posed as a writer. I never met Rup Chandra Bista, so I can’t write about him from a personal perspective. Sometimes, it’s easy to exaggerate a person's character when trying to make the narrative more dramatic, making them seem different from who they truly were. To ensure I was fair in my portrayal, after finishing the draft, I gave it to Rup Chandra Bista’s nephew, Bhuwan Prakash Bista, for his review. He raised similar questions and suggested a few corrections.Taking his feedback seriously, I revised the manuscript several times, carefully considering what he was trying to convey. After four or five rounds of edits, I feel I was able to present a more accurate balance of Bista's personality.However, my portrayal is still based on my understanding of him as a charismatic leader. I gathered information by listening to people who knew him and reading articles about his life, but my depiction may not fully capture his philosophy. That’s why I called it fiction.Why did you write about Rup Chandra Bista?In 2020, I did a play about Yogmaya, which was well-received. Yogmaya advocated a ‘dharma rajya’—a just and righteous society. While searching for another figure with a similar revolutionary spirit, I came across Rup Chandra Bista, whose story captivated me. A film about Bista was planned then, but the project was halted for 3-4 years and eventually cancelled. One of my brothers suggested turning the story into a drama. However, I was more fascinated with the narrative itself, and instead of writing it for the stage, I chose to turn it into fiction. That’s how the idea for the book emerged.Another reason I decided to write about Bista is that, in today’s political landscape, I don't see any leader with a philosophy like his. Bista was a leader who connected with people from all social classes. He had a separate group for children, encouraging them to “Know”—his guiding motto. He believed that awareness was key to individual and societal change. He also formed a group for women and supported their causes.Although Bista came from a wealthy family, he chose to live among the poor. He worked alongside them, striving to enlighten and uplift the marginalised.Bista’s deep connection with people and unique vision drew me to his story, leading me to base my book on his life.How important is your new book in today’s political and social climate? Looking back at history, Rup Chandra Bista was a political figure who thrived within the system of his time, winning elections multiple times during the Panchayat era. Yet, he wasn't afraid to openly criticise the Panchayat governments for their wrongdoings. Despite his privileged background, Bista lived a simple life. He strongly believed in reusing things and always wore second-hand clothes. In today’s world, with issues like climate change and overuse of resources, Bista’s lifestyle should resonate with our society. Inspired by him, I’ve started sleeping on the floor to feel more connected to the Earth.Bista also spent two decades living with farmers in Sim Bhanjyang, where he grazed goats and cultivated potatoes and cauliflower to improve their livelihoods. His focus on uplifting the underprivileged reflected his belief that society can only progress when the most disadvantaged rise.Looking at Nepal’s current political situation—where there is no consensus among parties and governance feels disorganised—alongside society’s increasingly materialistic values, I believe this book is more relevant than ever.How has your background in drama influenced your approach to writing fiction?As a drama student, I naturally include a lot of dialogue in my fiction writing. Writers like Buddhisagar and Subin Bhattarai often focus on playing with words and descriptions, but in my process, I focus on creating scenes, establishing characters, and weaving in dialogues. For instance, my book ‘Rudane’ has plenty of dramatic dialogue. Without them, the book could have risked becoming a straightforward biography. However, the dialogue helped breathe life into the characters. Writing them and building scenes allowed me to bring the story to life.Writing drama in Nepal is particularly challenging. The play's audience is small, and there is no guarantee that it will reach its intended audience or be published and read. That's one of the reasons I shifted toward fiction writing. However, I still translate plays I enjoy, which helps me balance my love for both forms. Even in my fiction, especially in the dialogues, the influence of drama is quite evident.While fiction usually requires fewer dialogues than drama, writing both involves building vivid scenes. For example, when writing a scene with four characters in a café, I instinctively imagine the entire setting, down to the smallest details. My background in drama has been invaluable in this regard, as it has helped me visualise scenes more easily and bring them to life in my fiction.What message do you want to convey to readers through your book? Rup Chandra Bista's life offers many valuable lessons. He believed in living a minimalist lifestyle and prioritised using Nepali products. Bista often wore clothes, bags, and other items made from burlap sacks. Despite being offered prestigious jobs, including one by Juddha Shumsher, he always put the well-being of others before his own.In contrast, today's generation often focuses more on personal gains than thinking of others. Through my book, I hope readers will learn from Bista’s selfless lifestyle and reflect on how they can also think about the needs of others. Bista was a man of strong principles and died on his terms. His statement, “Those I tried to awaken never did. Those who were awakened only ended up supporting the opposition,” reflects his deep frustration with the political system of his time.Beyond the political and social lessons, Bista's life, as shared through various articles and stories, offers timeless insights into leadership, selflessness, and the pursuit of justice for all.Tanka Chaulagain’s book recommendationsSotalaAuthor: Dor Bahadur BistaPublisher: Sajha PrakashanYear: 1976Bista's work captures a bygone era when many Nepalis journeyed to Tibet for the salt trade, offering readers a glimpse into Nepali society at that time.Lamppost Bata Khaseko JoonAuthor: Manu ManjilPublisher: FinePrintYear: 2011This poetry collection features forty-six free verse poems and the book is known for its portrayal of contemporary Nepali culture.Mantha Darayeko JugAuthor: Mohan Mainali Publisher: Heritage Publishers and DistributorYear: 2015This book chronicles the lives of those who were killed during the war, highlighting their valiant efforts to protect themselves and their families.YashodharaAuthor: Haribol KaflePublisher: Lipi BooksYear: 2023Told from Yashodhara's perspective, this novel provides a fresh view of Siddhartha's journey to becoming the Buddha.UlarAuthor: Nayanraj PandeyPublisher: Tanneri PrakashanYear: 1998This book is a window into the harsh reality of politics and people who have suffered from political instability. \nRepresentatives at the first national conference of the Rastriya Swatantra Party saw factionalism within the party.Some of the representatives who arrived in Kathmandu three days ago for the two-day gathering starting on Tuesday said that growing factionalism is not healthy for the new political outfit promising to challenge traditional forces like the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML.“We were told that factionalism existed in our party in various forms, but we denied such claims. However, during our three days in Kathmandu, we witnessed it,” a group of party members told the Post. It seems that President Rabi Lamichhane and Vice-president Swarnim Wagle are not in the same boat on how the party should function, they added.RSP acting spokesperson Manish Jha explains that it is the lack of synchronisation—rather than differences—between the leaders. “People from various schools of thought came together to form the RSP. It is true that we lack synchronisation, but it would be wrong to portray it as differences.”Another leader of the party said on condition of anonymity that the party has two schools of thought—one based on democratic principles and the other opposed to it.RSP acting general secretary Kabindra Burlakoti claims that the party is united.In conversations with the Post, representatives from Kathmandu Valley, Pokhara and Chitwan sounded more optimistic with the central leadership while those from remote areas were confused over their take on the party’s central leadership.The representatives from Madhesh were mild in their opinion about the leadership.Moreover, representatives were also not very positive about the way the central leadership is investing their energy to claim that Lamichhane had got a clean chit from the parliamentary special committee formed to investigate crisis-ridden cooperatives.The probe panel, which submitted its report to the House of Representatives, has recommended the government prosecute Lamichhane, along with his former business partner GB (Gitendra Babu) Rai, board member of the media Kumar Ramtel and initial founder Chhabi Lal Joshi as per the prevailing laws. The inquiry committee, however, has said it couldn’t establish Lamichhane’s role in rerouting the cooperatives fund to Gorkha Media Network.“It would have been better had the central leadership waited to see how the government would take action,” the group of representatives from western Nepal told the Post. “In case Lamichhane is booked under the law, it could be counterproductive for the party in the long run.”The political campaign started by the RSP won’t get stalled even without Lamichhane, the representatives said, expressing their confidence in the party’s longevity.Lamichhane also presented a political report incorporating proposed statutory changes, the party’s commitments to voters, policy agenda presented by Swarnim Wagle at the Jaleshwar meeting and the conclusion drawn from the closed session of the national conference.Lamichhane’s report states that the policy paper presented in Jaleshwar defined ‘constitutional socialism’ as the party’s political ideology. Lamichhane also accuses the ruling Nepali Congress and CPN-UML of trying to lead the country to a two-party system by polarising smaller parties. “On the pretext of administrative reform, they are planning to wipe out the existence of small parties,” the report reads. “Potentially, this step can bring together new parties that want to be an alternative political force sooner or later.”Asked about RSP’s possible alliance with other parties, Burlakoti said though they are not in talks with the main opposition CPN (Maoist Centre), they are in regular contact with several independent candidates of last election.Asked if they are in discussion with Kathmandu Metropolitan City Mayor Balendra Shah, who won the 2022 local election independently, Burlakoti said: “Strategic moves are not to be disclosed.”However, when the national conference concluded after Lamichhane presented his report, representatives arriving from around the country were displeased.“This is not the way a party functions,” a representative told the Post, asking not to be named for fears of reprisal.When leaders put themselves at the centre and cadres in the periphery, the party’s downfall begins, another representative said. Acting General Secretary Burlakoti, however, defended the party leadership. “Our national conference was designed this way,” Burlakoti said. The report presented by the chair will be discussed in the party’s Mahakali-Mechi campaign that will start soon, he added.“At the national conference, we gave 5 percent of the total representatives (1500) time to speak, but those who spoke exceeded that number,” Burlakoti said.The conference, however, passed Lamichhane’s report. On Wednesday, Lamichhane announced the date of the party’s first general convention. It will be held on May 8-10 at a yet-undecided venue.“I would like to inform you that the Central Committee has become the general convention organising committee,” Burlakoti said. Lamichhane also announced the ‘Mahakali-Mechi Campaign’ to interact with the general public.In his report, Lamichhane has proposed a person not affiliated to any party to be elected the country’s president, directly elected executive head, or the prime minister. He also proposes giving the nation’s vice president the responsibility to chair the National Assembly.While the paper bats for a fully proportional electoral system, it says provincial assemblies cannot be accepted in the current shape.However, this does not mean the RSP is against the federal structure gained through the sacrifice of thousands of people, another representative said. “Our party has no strength to amend the constitution and scrap the federal structure. Therefore, for the time being, voices are growing among the party members about accepting the present political structure,” Khemraj Koirala, a conference representative from Kailali told the Post.Party members also suggested downsizing the number of ministers to make the provincial system functional, Koirala said.The report also stands for reducing the number of municipalities to less than 500, from the current 753. \nThe coalition government of the CPN-UML and the Nepali Congress has reiterated its commitment to review the achievements made and weaknesses observed in the course of implementing the constitution in the past nine years.The two ruling parties have pledged to amend the constitution based on a broader understanding made through discussions, dialogues and consultations with political parties, civil society, intelligentsia, constitutional experts and the public.The parties have said such amendments will be made mainly based on the findings of the review and experiences of implementing it. Moreover, the parties said that establishing political stability in the country would be the major objective of the amendment.The two ruling parties made the commitments in the common minimum programme of the government, which was submitted to Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli and Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba on Wednesday evening. The parties had earlier formed a four-member panel to draft the government’s programme based on a seven-point agreement reached between the Congress and the UML in the first week of July. Party general secretary Gagan Thapa and spokesperson Prakash Sharan Mahat from Congress, and party deputy general secretaries Pradeep Gyawali and Bishnu Rimal from the CPN-UML were tasked to prepare the document. They jointly submitted the document to the two party chiefs and made it public.“The achievements of the 2006 movement and the fundamental pillars of this constitution including federal, republic and inclusive governance system will be further institutionalised and strengthened,” the document says.The seven-page document is divided into eight subtitles—safeguarding national interest and independent foreign policy; protection, implementation and amendment of the constitution; good governance and quality service delivery; dynamic economy and development; ensuring social justice and fundamental rights; youth partnership; transitional justice, sustainable peace and social harmony; and miscellaneous.The coalition has pledged to set up a high-powered cooperative regulatory body as per the recommendation of the parliamentary inquiry committee to address the problems seen in the cooperative sector.“Taking action against those involved in misusing funds from cooperatives, the return of depositors’ money will be ensured,” the common minimum programme states.The ruling parties have pledged to punish corrupt people irrespective of the individuals’ power and positions. On the economic front, the coalition has vowed to expedite generation and transmission of hydroelectricity and further intensify the electrification process. \nThe erstwhile Pushpa Kamal Dahal government on April 12 constituted a committee led by Om Prakash Mishra, a former chief justice, to nominate candidates to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons. While the government picked four members for the committee, the fifth member is either the chairperson of the National Human Rights Commission or someone nominated by him. Initially, the commission had insisted that revision of the Enforced Disappearance Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act was a precondition for its participation in the committee, but following the Act’s amendment, it agreed to join the Mishra panel. However, three weeks after President Ramchandra Paudel authenticated the bill to amend the Act that the federal parliament endorsed, the constitutional human rights watchdog has yet to recommend its representative. Its officials said they are waiting for a formal request from the Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs, as they expect a new letter in the changed context.“We have been told the ministry would send a new request letter for our representative, given the new context following the amendment to the Act,” said a commission member. The revised Act states that the recommendation committee has two months to make nominations for the chairpersons and members of the two commissions. It has already been five months since the Mishra-led panel was formed. However, a senior official at the law ministry said he does not think a new process needs to start just because the Act has been amended. “The two month countdown began the day the revised Act was enacted,” said the official. “I also don’t think the ministry told the commission that it would send a new request letter. If such a message was conveyed, it may have come from the political level.” Those involved in forging all-party consensus on the amendment say tensions between the CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre) have stalled the transitional justice process. Relations between the two parties have not been cordial ever since the formation of the new ruling alliance. The UML has consistently referred to the Maoist insurgency as ‘violence’, while the Maoist Centre has warned that the present KP Sharma Oli government could meet the same fate as Sheikh Hasina Wazed, the immediate past prime minister of Bangladesh.“The tussle between the two parties has directly affected the ongoing process,” one leader involved in the negotiations told the Post. “Oli doesn't seem as interested as he was earlier.”The committee was formed in May amid reservations from conflict-era victims of human rights violations and human rights defenders, who demanded that the Act be amended before selecting office bearers. The government, however, argued that forming the committee was necessary as per the Supreme Court’s March 12 order to the government to select office bearers for the two commissions within a month.The court had asked the government to constitute task forces within the commissions to conduct preliminary investigations into the victims’ complaints until the office bearers were appointed.Following the court’s order, the victims and human rights defenders demanded the government and the parties endorse the legal amendments by the top court’s deadline before starting the selection process. However, the amendment bill couldn’t be endorsed within the deadline, prompting the government to form a committee based on existing law.Following the committee’s formation, the victims and human rights defenders requested the government to halt the selection process until the Act was amended. They also urged the national rights watchdog to hold off on sending its representative.The two commissions have been defunct since July 2022, when the government decided to extend their terms without retaining their chairmen and members. The government claimed the bill to amend the transitional justice law would be endorsed by October 2022, and the appointments made based on the revised Act.But it took over two years for the federal parliament to endorse the bill. The victims and human rights defenders are closely watching who will be appointed to the commissions.The Truth Commission has received 63,718 complaints, while the commission on disappearances is sitting on around 2,400 cases. The new teams will have four years to accomplish their tasks, though there are provisions for their extension. The commissions that were formed in 2015 have done nothing other than collect complaints and conduct preliminary investigations on some of them.  \nRastriya Swatantra Party chair Rabi Lamichhane, addressing a two-day national conference of the party's central council that started on Tuesday, said that the emergence of the RSP has been a headache for Nepal’s traditional political parties.“Until we win a majority in the next election, their headache will continue,” Lamichhane said. “Some people think that if Rabi Lamichhane is defeated, then the role of RSP in national politics will shrink. However, with or without Rabi, RSP now will move ahead as a campaign.”At the national conference of central council members, all seven provincial committees presented their reports. In the process, some committees briefed the RSP on the financial difficulties they are facing to run their day-to-day activities, whereas others hinted at the challenges they are facing building the party organisation.Party’s Koshi provincial president Rajesh Timilsina said there are 25,000 RSP cadres in the province. Due to irregular levy payments from cadres, it had been difficult to run the party.“We now face the challenge in expanding the party’s membership base,” a party leader quoted Timilsina as saying. There were more people frustrated with the party’s activities than those attracted to it.Timilsina also called for a regular financial source to carry out party activities, the leader said.RSP provincial president for Madhesh Tapeshwar Yadav presented a report depicting the party in good light in the province. “If general elections were to be held now, our party would either lead the province or take the main opposition position,” a party insider told the Post, quoting Yadav.Achyut Lamichhane, the provincial chief of Bagmati, claimed that the leadership had expanded the membership in Chitwan and Kathmandu by 7,000 and 5,000, respectively.Party’s Lumbini committee chief Devraj Pathak, presenting the provincial report, said that a funds crunch had hampered the committee’s activities. In Karnali, the RSP is tackling geographical difficulties in welcoming more members to the party. Sudurpaschim party chief also briefed the leadership on the difficulties the provincial committee is facing in expanding the membership, the party leaders said.The financial report presented by RSP treasurer Lima Adhikari suggests that the party’s income totalled Rs34 million in the fiscal year 2023-2024. The amount includes membership fee, donations, sale of publicity materials, and interest on deposits, among other sources. According to RSP leaders, at least 50 representatives expressed their opinions in the ‘open session’ on Tuesday. They suggested that the leadership should be protected from external attacks, and the party chair should be allowed to form a team so as to ease the party’s operation.Vice-chair Swarnim Wagle presented a brief explanation on the ‘policy paper’ endorsed by the party’s Jaleshwar meeting last year.Acting General Secretary Kabindra Burlakoti presented a proposal for amending the party statute. Burlakoti proposes three vice-presidents and joint general secretaries, including a woman in each position.Apart from the treasurer and spokesperson, all the office bearers are also proposed to be directly elected.Though the party called its first national conference to discuss a wide array of issues, the report submitted by the parliamentary special probe committee on Monday dominated the discourse.The report on crisis-ridden cooperatives, submitted to the government via the Speaker of the House of Representatives, also concerns the fate of RSP President Rabi Lamichhane. Though the report does not directly implicate Lamichhane in the cooperatives fraud, it links him to the spending of the money illegally sourced from multiple cooperatives. The report also recommended prosecuting four individuals: Lamichhane, then-managing director of Gorkha Media Network; chairman Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai; board member Kumar Ramtel; and initial founder Chhabi Lal Joshi.Lamichhane was accused of diverting funds from multiple cooperatives to run the media company that operated the Galaxy 4K Television channel, which ceased operations last year. Rai and Lamichhane co-founded and jointly ran the media company before Lamichhane joined politics in June 2022.Lamichhane also claims to have held 15 percent of sweat shares in the company, which he sold after completing the legal procedure as he quit the television. However, the committee’s investigation found those claims to be false. Denying his involvement in the cooperatives scam, Lamichhane and other RSP lawmakers attacked the Nepali Congress for its repeated stance that led to the parliamentary committee’s formation.RSP leaders at the meeting tried to establish that Lamichhane had got a clean chit from the probe.Before concluding the conference on Wednesday, Lamichhane will present his political report. This conference is also expected to schedule the party’s first general convention for May next year. \nThe parliamentary special probe committee formed to investigate crisis-ridden cooperatives has concluded that Rabi Lamichhane, the chairman of the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), was involved in misusing millions of rupees received from cooperatives when he was the managing director of the now defunct Gorkha Media Network.The committee’s report recommends that the government take action against former deputy prime minister and home minister Lamichhane for the act.Lamichhane was accused of diverting funds from multiple cooperatives to run the media company that operated the Galaxy 4K Television channel, which ceased operations last year. Chairman GB (Gitendra Babu) Rai and managing director Lamichhane co-founded and jointly ran the media company before Lamichhane joined politics in June 2022.“During our investigation, we found that the investment in the Gorkha Media Network had been made with the money diverted from various cooperatives,” Ishwari Devi Neupane, a Nepali Congress member of the probe committee, told the Post. “Although Lamichhane has been found guilty of using funds from cooperatives for Gorkha Media Network, it could not directly link him to the rerouting of cooperative funds.”Lamichhane has consistently denied any involvement in the misappropriation of cooperative funds. However, the report of the parliamentary special committee formed to investigate crisis-ridden cooperatives has concluded that Rs650 million from five credit cooperatives, including the Pokhara-based Surya Darshan Cooperative, Butwal-based Supreme Cooperatives, Chitwan-based Sahara Cooperatives, Birgunj-based Sano Paila Cooperatives, and Kathmandu-based Swarnalaxmi Cooperatives, were diverted to the Gorkha Media Network.The committee’s report, which was submitted to Speaker Devraj Ghimire at a meeting of the House of Representatives on Monday, recommends prosecuting four individuals, including Lamichhane, the then managing director of Gorkha Media Network; chairman Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai; a board member Kumar Ramtel; and initial founder Chhabi Lal Joshi.“Those in the roles of shareholders, board members and managing director can’t evade accountability and liability for the money that comes into the company,” reads the report submitted by the chair of the probe panel, CPN-UML lawmaker Surya Thapa. It states that the bank account holders who operate the account should be responsible for how the money in that account is used. “Since Rai, Ramtel, Lamichhane and Joshi are seen to be using the money that came into the company from various cooperatives, we recommend that the Nepal government prosecute them in accordance with the prevailing laws,” the report further says. An Interpol diffusion notice has been issued against Rai, who has been on the run and is believed to be abroad. Ramtel is in judicial custody.The probe panel has also recommended that the government make binding legal arrangements for the payment for share purchases and sales. The report also suggests that the government make proper legal arrangements concerning sweat shares and prompt relevant agencies to address the matter. Lamichhane claimed to have held 15 percent of sweat shares in the company, which he said he sold after completing all legal procedures. However, the committee’s investigation found those claims to be false. “Forgery was involved in the purchase and sale of sweat shares,” Lekhnath Dahal, the CPN (Maoist Centre) lawmaker and committee member, told the Post. The report states that the office bearers of the media company had used forged documents while transferring the company’s shares, and recommends that the government carry out further investigation of the matter and take necessary actions.However, RSP leaders had their own interpretation of the probe committee’s report.RSP chair Lamichhane and Vice-chair Swarnim Wagle, while leaving the House meeting, claimed that the committee had acquitted Lamichhane of the allegations that he was involved in embezzlement of cooperative funds. They said they welcome the committee’s report, and noted that Shishir Khanal, the RSP member in the committee, did not even write a note of dissent “as the report had exonerated the party chair”.RSP leaders also claimed that the accusations from other parties had been proved false.Manish Jha, acting spokesperson of the RSP, said that even Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa had claimed that Lamichhane was directly involved in diverting cooperative funds to the media company using his own signature. Jha claimed that the report disproves this accusation. “We had acknowledged that Gorkha Media Network had diverted the cooperative funds for its operation, which the report confirms,” he added.“We had assumed the report might do great damage to our party, but we are pleased how it has been presented,” Jha told the Post. “Things will become clearer after the full report is made public.”But committee members don’t agree with the RSP leaders’ interpretation. “They may have assumed that their party chair would be directly implicated, but that did not happen,” said Dhruba Bahadur Pradhan, a Rastriya Prajantra Party (RPP) lawmaker and committee member. He said that not being directly implicated does not mean that he was not involved in the scam. “Our law does not permit the rerouting of the cooperative funds to a private company, yet Lamichhane and the company did exactly that. He can be prosecuted for this,” Pradhan, who is also a former chief of Nepal Police, told the Post.Legal experts say that Lamichhane could face prosecution under four different laws based on the findings of the parliamentary special inquiry committee’s report. “Lamichhane could be charged the cooperative fraud case under the Cooperative Act, fraud and duping under the National Penal Code, organised crime cases under the Organised Crime Prevention Act and money laundering case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act,” advocate Om Parkash Aryal told the Post.The committee was formed on May 28 and had four-point terms of reference to investigate cooperative funds embezzlement. Among the four-point ToR, the cooperatives linked with the funding of the now-defunct Gorkha Media Network will also be probed.The probe panel had three months to complete its work from the first day of the committee meeting which was held a week later after the committee’s formation. When the committee could not complete its task in the given time, Parliament had extended the term by 15 days, to September 22. But the committee has submitted its report before the expiry of the extended time. Speaker Devraj Ghimire forwarded the report to the government for implementation after committee chair Thapa submitted it to the House of Representatives on Monday.The lower house formed the special inquiry committee after the erstwhile main opposition party Nepali Congress obstructed House meetings continuously for weeks demanding the formation of such a panel.The Congress, along with the RPP, demanded a parliamentary special probe committee to investigate the cooperative embezzlement, claiming involvement of the then deputy prime minister and home minister Lamichhane. The then ruling parties the CPN (Maoist Centre), the major coalition partners UML and Lamichhne’s RSP were against the demand.Lamichhane, host of a popular television show, founded the RSP in June 2022. RSP is the fourth largest party in Parliament with 21 lawmakers (including deputy speaker).He is linked with multiple controversies. His case regarding the use of dual passports is sub judice. He was also stripped of his position as a lawmaker and minister for home affairs in early 2023 after he was found guilty of contesting the 2022 election without proper Nepali citizenship. Lamichhane had obtained an American green card, but contested the election in Chitwan-2 without first re-acquiring Nepali citizenship. He won by a huge margin. Lamichhane, who had been stripped of the lawmaker position on charges of using dual citizenship, got reelected as the lawmaker from the same constituency in a by-election held in 2023. Similarly, the parliamentary special probe committee has recommended that the government investigate Jyoti Gurung, former wife of Nepali Congress Vice President and lawmaker Dhan Raj Gurung. Jyoti Gurung, who was a board member of Miteri Cooperative, is accused of mishandling more than Rs120 million of the cooperative’s funds. “The Miteri cooperative chairman, Khumbharaj Gurung, had complained to the committee about Dhan Raj Gurung and his wife over their mishandling of the cooperative's money,” Pradhan said. “So the committee report has recommended further investigation into the Gurungs.” On Friday, the special committee members visited the Miteri Cooperatives office at Mahalaxmisthan in Lalitpur, to discuss the matter with its chairman.After being charged with embezzling the cooperative’s funds, Congress Vice President Gurung, speaking in Parliament on September 10, called for a thorough probe to clear his name. Pradhan said the committee found no evidence implicating lawmaker Gurung in the misappropriation. Cooperatives are considered to be self-regulatory bodies, but in Nepal a large number of cooperatives are being operated arbitrarily by a handful of operators. The committee report also suggests that the government should establish a strong regulatory body to look after the financial aspect of cooperatives.Apart from chair Thapa the committee had six other members. Sarita Bhusal from the UML; Dilendra Prasad Badu and Ishwari Devi Neupane from the Congress; Lekhnath Dahal from Maoist Centre; Sishir Khanal from RSP and Dhruba Bahadur Pradhan from RPP. \nPanic gripped locals in ward 12 of Chandragiri Municipality, Kathmandu, on Thursday morning after a suspicious object was found in the locality.The suspicious object was spotted in front of Balambu Secondary School, sparking fears of a bomb threat.Locals informed the police, and a bomb disposal team from the Nepal Army arrived at the scene. According to the NA Directorate of Public Relations and Information, the team disposed of the suspicious object, which turned out to be a pressure cooker.   \nKathmandu Metropolitan City has extended the area to prohibit building any structure on either side of the rivers in its territory.In a notice on Wednesday, the city office stated that construction of any structure has been barred on the additional 20 meters from the existing prohibited area.According to the metropolis notice, if the city has, under the existing rule, prohibited any construction on 20 meters from the area marked as river, the prohibited area will now be altogether 40 meters on either side of the waterway.The metropolis said the decision was taken based on a recent Supreme Court verdict that directed the authorities concerned to prohibit construction within an additional 20 metres from riverbanks in the Kathmandu Valley.Currently, construction is permitted only 20 metres beyond major riverbanks in the Kathmandu metropolis.The notice issued by the metropolis states, “No construction will be permitted on an additional 20 metres of land on either side of the river, and ongoing construction will be halted.”It has also asked one and all not to release contaminated water, including sewage, into Bagmati River and its tributaries. “Private and government buildings, as well as commercial properties, must install soak pits for groundwater recharge,” it said. “Waste must not be disposed of in the rivers. Non-compliance will lead to legal action under existing laws.” \nThe rhythmic beat of the Dha echoes through a Bhaktapur alley, blending with the energetic footsteps of dancers. Bhaktapur, which sees jatras and festivals round the year, is no stranger to music, dance and celebrations. But this is not an ordinary occasion. The performers in question are Lakhe dancers who are reviving the Ranjitkar Lakhe dance after a century.The young dancers are preparing for Indra Jatra this year, where mask-clad Lakhe dancers roam the streets to rid the community of hardships and suffering. Lakhe, demon deities revered as protectors of people and crops, are thought to reside in the demonic mask. As the dancer dons the mask, the spirit is said to take over.Bhaktapur was once a key site for the Ranjitkar Lakhe performances, but the art form vanished from the city after the 1934 earthquake.“Bhaktapur suffered the most damage during the 1934 earthquake,\" says Ganesh Ram Ranjit, treasurer of the Ranjitkar Group’s Bhaktapur branch. “The destruction left residents struggling to recover for a decade, making it nearly impossible to perform the costly Lakhe dance.”The Ranjitkar Group discovered the extinct dance in the year the group was established. They located a Lakhe temple in Bhaktapur that had closed after the earthquake. After two years of research, they learned that performing the Lakhe dance was seen as a good omen in Bhaktapur and involved hosting community feasts. However, the high cost of this tradition forced many to sell their properties, rendering it unfeasible in the city’s post-earthquake conditions. Over time, the dance was abandoned as more lands supporting these cultural events were lost during rapid urbanisation.“There was a significant decline in our engagement with our cultural heritage,” says Rabi Shakya, a sculptor and Lakhe dance teacher training the new dancers. “The encouraging change now is the strong interest from the new generation, which is making it possible to revive intangible heritage like this dance.”After 100 years, the Ranjitkar Lakhe Dance is making a return to Bhaktapur at this year’s Indra Jatra.“It’s challenging to accurately re-enact the dance since it hasn’t been seen in a century,” Shakya notes. “As a sculptor, I drew inspiration from Bhaktapur’s revered Shree Navadurga Bhawani to create the Lakhe’s mask.” Similarly, the dance was choreographed by studying Lakhe dances from Kathmandu, Patan, and Banepa within the Ranjitkar community, and combining them with traditional steps from Bhaktapur Lakhe dances.“As for the musical instruments, we are using traditional instruments like Dha, Dhime, and Ponga, which are said to excite the Lakhe,” says Rajendra Maharjan, Lakhe dance teacher and musician.Maharjan is one of the experienced Newari arts teachers working to revive the lost Lakhe dance. He is involved in training young students in cultural arts and is now dedicated to the Ranjitkar dance training, with the students practising together nearly every day.“Becoming a Lakhe performer involves more than just wearing the costume and mask,” said Sudin Ranjit, a Lakhe dance student. “We must train extensively with our teachers, and it demands a lot of hard work.”To Ranjit, a resident of Bhaktapur, the training is more than learning a new craft; it is a matter of protecting culture. Growing up only interested in instruments, he slowly understood how important continuing cultural practices like Lakhe dances is for their community.“The dance will not only bolster Bhaktapur’s cultural pride but also boost tourism and create jobs,” says Dr Purushottam Lochan Shrestha, a professor and researcher specialising in Bhaktapur and Newari culture.Shrestha notes that reviving the dance would offer employment to everyone involved, from the dancers and the sculptor making the masks to those participating in the rituals. “Economic centres throughout the city, from small businesses to large industries, will benefit from the influx of tourists attracted by the Lakhe dance,” Shrestha adds, commending the Ranjitkar group's initiative.Once the Ranjitkar community revitalises the Lakhe dance, the Ranjitkar group plans to set up a new Guthi house with a fresh community fund and organise annual events for the dance.“The Lakhe dance won’t let them separate,” Shakya remarks.In today’s globalised world, where identity often merges into a homogenised blend, shared cultural practices provide a sense of connection and belonging. This new Lakhe dance embodies that spirit of togetherness for the community involved.“Reviving the dance after 100 years,” Shakya says, “is about preserving our culture for the next 300 years.” \nThe Lions Club of Kathmandu Corporate, Nepal MD325-D has felicitated various personalities as part of its endeavour to recognise the contribution of the individuals and business entities for the society.As part of its campaign, the Lions Club of Kathmandu honoured Prateek Pradhan with Social Journalism Award, Sylapa T Rimponche with Social Spiritual Award, Erika Gurung with Social Player Award, Ramesh Corporation with Social Corporate House Award, Rajendra Malla with Social Corporate Leader Award and Rajesh Hamal with Social Celebrity Award.Likewise, Chandra Ghimire is honoured with Social Bureaucratic Award, Binod Das with Sports Management Award, Anil Kedia with Social Academic Award, Mohan Ojha with Social Management Award and Surya Nepal with Corporate Social Responsibility Award.The Lionism embarked in Nepal in 1971 as the Lions Club of Biratnagar under the stewardship of former Prime Minister Matrika Prasad Koirala.The Lions Clubs International says it has over 2,000 clubs operating across the nation. \nThe government has declared a public holiday in the Kathmandu Valley on Sunday to celebrate the Bhoto Jatra.On the occasion of the festival, a public holiday has been declared in the three districts of Kathmandu Valley [Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur], according to a statement by Narayan Prasad Bhattarai, spokesperson for the Ministry of Home Affairs, on Friday.The government announces a public holiday each year on this occasion.The month-long chariot-pulling festival of Rato Machhindranath concludes with the displaying of a bhoto (a jewel-studded vest) at Jawalakhel, Lalitpur. It is an annual cultural and religious ritual of displaying the black jewel-studded vest believed to be of then Nagraj, the serpent King.Machhindranath is revered as the God of rain, good harvest and prosperity. Paying homage to Lord Machhindranath is believed to bring good luck and fulfil one’s wishes. \n\n\nThe Nepal-India Chamber of Commerce & Industry (NICCI) participated in the Bodhgaya-Nalanda Conference—BIMSTEC Plus, which was organised by the Synergia Foundation in collaboration with Nalanda University in Bihar, India, on September 12.Sunil KC, vice-president of NICCI, representing the Nepali delegation, attended the three-day event. KC emphasised the importance of cultural and economic integration among BIMSTEC nations while speaking at the event session entitled, ‘Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) Plus: Shared Cultural Values and Futures’.He highlighted how the BIMSTEC bridges South and Southeast Asia, fostering a deep-rooted connection through shared historical values and economic ties.KC underscored the vital role of culture in regional development, noting that shared cultural heritage can drive economic collaboration, particularly in sectors like tourism, education, and creative industries. He called for greater cooperation to promote tourism, leveraging the region’s rich cultural diversity, and boosting local economies.The conference explored the vision of \"BIMSTEC Plus\" to extend partnerships beyond the region, creating wider economic corridors and addressing global challenges such as climate change, digital innovation, and economic resilience. \nGeopolitical conflicts and tensions are fuelling a surge of economic fragmentation and protectionism around the world, which would hit poor nations in particular, experts warn. In addition, there is a climate crisis, which would require huge amounts of money to cushion the shocks.But who will fund it?The Horizons Dialogue series, organised by the British Embassy and UK International Development in Kathmandu on Wednesday, brought together national and international experts to discuss the challenges and opportunities in Nepal’s development in the next ten years amid geopolitical conflicts and growing climate crisis. Experts have warned that the geopolitical conflict's repercussions could cause Nepal to lose foreign grants, loans, and other support.“We [Nepal] have seen a decline in international cooperation after the Covid-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine war and conflict in the Middle-East countries,” said Kalpana Khanal, senior research fellow leading the Center for Economic and Infrastructure Development Policy at the Policy Research Institute. She was speaking on the theme ‘Navigating Nepal’s Fragility’.Khanal said, “The world is experiencing violence, interstate wars, and economic turbulence, with some countries adopting more anti-globalisation policies and populist regimes. This could cause a decline in international cooperation.”What will happen then? Khanal explained that such a scenario would force Nepal to focus on revenue collection to repay loans and interest rather than funding critical projects.“Currently, Nepal is channelling 22 percent of its total revenue towards debt servicing. In such a situation, if we do not receive the grant and rely more on loans, it will hinder overall development,” said Khanal.Nepal's public debt is 43 percent of its total GDP, half of which is made up of external loans and support.“We can potentially face a decline in international cooperation, as global lenders and development partners may channel funds towards the war-ridden countries like Ukraine and Palestine,” Khanal said.Khanal said climate change, amid geopolitical tension, may hamper projects built with foreign loans. “Many of the ongoing hydropower projects in Nepal rely on foreign loans. The devastating floods and landslides due to extreme weather conditions increase the project's costs. This, too, impacts public debt,” Khanal said.The global war will bring not only disaster but also hunger.Khanal said Nepal’s food inflation increased sharply after the Covid-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war. “It’s high time the country focused on food security.”According to a report prepared by the organisers, over the next decade, changes in the demand for Nepali workers, particularly in India and the Middle East, or geopolitical events that limit labour migration could have major impacts on the national development trajectory.Climate change, disasters, and health crises could also have significant economic impacts. In recent years, disruptions to agriculture from droughts and floods have led to sharp rises in food prices, the report said.Nearly 60 percent of Nepal’s population relies on agriculture, and two-thirds of that group is engaged in subsistence farming. The report said that, as a result of male outmigration, women constitute 73 percent of the agricultural workforce.Over the past decades, air quality has significantly deteriorated, consistently exceeding the World Health Organization's limits. The participants say that without significant intervention, it is likely to deteriorate further in the next five years.“But hopefully, in 10 years, we have projected some improvement in some areas,” said Arun Bhakta Shrestha, senior climate change specialist and programme manager for the Regional River Basins and Cryosphere programme of International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD).Air pollution in the Kathmandu valley and the Tarai presents a growing health crisis, with around 12 percent of Kathmandu’s population suffering from chronic respiratory diseases like asthma and pneumonia, threatening to reverse reductions in infant and child mortality, the report said.Air pollution hazards will be worsened by more frequent hydrometeorological events such as droughts and heatwaves, with huge knock-on effects for the health of the population, the report said.Comparing the National Board of Diseases report of Nepal between 2011 and 2021, in 2011, malnutrition was the number one cause of death but now it's air pollution. Over 20 percent of deaths are now caused by air pollution in Nepal, which is around 42,000 deaths annually, said Dr Meghnath Dhimal, an environmental health scientist and chief research officer at Nepal Health Research Council.As South Asia is suffering from heat waves, which increase non-communicable diseases, many people are now using more chemicals than before because once the temperature goes high, the effectiveness of the insecticide goes down, Dhimal said. “As a result, more people are suffering from cancer, diabetes, malaises, and others,” he said.Climate change, air pollution, and bio-diseases may result in the epidemic of the non-communicable disease. As climate change and air pollution all cause non-communicable diseases, this share may go up to 90 percent in the next five to ten years, Dhimal said.Rob Fenn, the British ambassador to Nepal, said, “As the world grapples with climate change, Nepal is bearing the brunt despite contributing very little to global emissions.”It is vital that global action supports Nepal’s resilience and growth, Fenn said. “The UK will remain a reliable partner in helping Nepal recover from shocks, adapt to challenges, and thrive,” he said.“Our programmes will continue to invest in climate resilience, sustainable economic growth, and health systems that serve all communities.”  \nAlong with dengue infection, major hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley are seeing a significant surge in cases of viral fever, flu, typhoid, and seasonal influenza in recent days.Doctors attending to the patients said that the number of fever cases has risen compared to previous months, with some patients even developing pneumonia and requiring inpatient care due to worsening health.“Around 50 percent of the patients who come to the outpatient department at our hospital are fever cases,” said Dr Rita Hamal, a consultant paediatrician at the Chabahil-based Om Hospital and Research Centre. “Some children have also been diagnosed with pneumonia and have been admitted at the hospital for inpatient care.”Experts say the rise in fever and cold before weather transitions is concerning and that the spread of the virus could be behind the surge in infection rates.They say the influenza virus causes respiratory complications, which affect the lungs. The virus spreads quickly in communities. These diseases can cause fever, cough, body aches, occasional vomiting, diarrhoea, and pneumonia.Doctors say that while the number of new cases of fever and flu has risen significantly, the exact cause of the surge still remains unclear. Many patients do not opt for various diagnostic tests, and health workers also provide symptomatic care first.“There is no specific care for viral infections, including dengue,” said Hamal. “We provide symptomatic care only. So we do not know the actual cause of the ailments.”Doctors recommend multiple tests only for patients with serious health conditions. They say that early diagnosis is crucial for preventing infection, and patients recover quickly if treated in time. However, according to experts, the severity of the disease and the number of deaths increase if seasonal influenza cases are not diagnosed promptly.“We don’t know the actual cause of the surge in fever, flu, and other ailments,” said Dr Sumit Agrawal, spokesperson at the Kanti Children Hospital. “Almost all hospital beds have been occupied by ailing patients, and the number of fever cases has risen significantly recently.”The hospital, which also serves as the national referral centre for ailing children, said that over 1,200 children seek care daily, and 30 to 40 percent of them are fever and flu cases.Doctors at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital and Patan Hospital also said that the number of fever and flu cases has risen significantly of late.“Along with dengue cases, the number of people suffering from viral fever, flu, typhoid and other infections has increased at our hospital as well,” said Dr Yuba Nidhi Basaula, director at the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital in Teku, Kathmandu. “Most of the beds in our hospital have been occupied. The number of dengue infection cases has also surged lately.”Doctors at Patan Hospital said that in addition to fever cases, patients with diarrhoeal infections and other water-borne diseases are also seeking care. They expect more cases in the coming days, as fever and flu cases usually spike during weather transitions.Even though fever and flu cases are rising significantly, authorities remain unaware of the exact cause of the surge in infection rates.“When the cause of ailments is not ascertained, it becomes difficult to provide effective care,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at Sukraraj Hospital. “The number of people infected with influenza could be several times higher than those seeking care at hospitals, as many people suffering from influenza-like illness do not seek treatment unless they become serious.”A recent report by the Nepal Statistics Office also shows that cold and fever remain a significant concern, with an increase from 43.7 percent in 1995/96 to 51. 5 percent in 2022/23.Doctors say more people get infected with viruses during seasonal changes, as most viruses—adenovirus, rhinovirus, influenza virus, and even coronavirus—become active during these times, particularly in winter.However, they say this does not mean respiratory viruses do not spread at other times. People are continuously infected with respiratory viruses in other seasons as well, and those with weak immunity could become more severely affected by infections.Doctors urge everyone to take precautions against these risks and ask authorities to step up surveillance to determine the real causes of influenza-like illnesses. \nThe licences of hundreds of health facilities of Bagmati Province have not been renewed for the past two years, as the provincial government has yet to enact its public health law.Health officials say even if the licences of most private health facilities have expired, those facilities are not illegal.They, however, concede that no agency in the country is monitoring activities of the private health facilities and their service quality due to the failure to renew the licences.“Other provinces across the country have already passed the provincial public health act to govern private hospitals up to 200-bed capacity and other health facilities,” said Dr Arjun Sapkota, chief of the Health Office, Kathmandu. “We hope that the Bagmati provincial government will introduce the provincial public health act soon, which will clear the way for licence renewal of the institutions fulfilling the due procedure.”There are over 1,000 private health facilities, including 52 private hospitals, in Kathmandu district alone. If all the health facilities in the province are counted, they will number in thousands, officials said.Operators of private health facilities, including the Association of Private Health Institutions of Nepal (APHIN), an umbrella organisation of private hospital operators, complained that they are deprived of banking services, importing health equipment and other facilities due to the apathy of the relevant agencies to renew the licences.“We recently held discussion with officials at the Health Office, Kathmandu and drew their attention to the non-renewal of licences,” said Dr Padam Bahadur Khadka, chairman of the Private Health institutions of Nepal. “Health facilites have been facing several problems including problems in importing equipment and banking facilities, among others.”Health officials say that monitoring of private health facilities operating in the districts of the Bagmati Province has been halted due to non-renewal of licences. They say that the condition of hospital equipment, manpower, hospital waste management, power back-up, operation theatres and emergency wards also need to be monitored but remain unattended for years.Studies show over 95 percent private hospitals have been operating out of rented residential buildings that have no proper patient safety measures. Nor are the facilities equipped to withstand disasters like earthquake and fire, and to handle patient flow caused by such disasters and disease outbreaks.Buildings that are currently being used by private hospitals were built many years ago and do not meet the basic criteria as they aren’t equipped with emergency entry and exit points, fire escapes, and waiting areas, among others. Majority of private hospitals also lack the required human resource and force staff to work overtime in the absence of enough personnel.Inspections carried out in the past show that most hospitals are also found to be lacking in hazardous waste management systems. The inspection team of the Ministry of Health and Population and local units found that most hospitals segregate hospital waste but the waste is then sent to private companies for management, where household waste is mixed up with the hospital waste. When hazardous waste produced from hospitals is left untreated, chances of infection spreading in communities are high.“Once the provincial government brings the provincial public health act, we will monitor the health facilities and renew licences,” Sapkota said. \nA 24-year-old student has died from the Nipah virus in the southern Indian state of Kerala, a local medical official said on Monday, and 151 people who came into contact with the victim are under observation to prevent the spread of the deadly virus.This is the second death caused by Nipah in Kerala since July. Nipah is classified as a priority pathogen by the World Health Organization (WHO) because of its potential to trigger an epidemic. There is no vaccine to prevent infection and no treatment to cure it.Parts of Kerala are among those most at risk globally for outbreaks of the virus, a Reuters investigation showed last year. Nipah, which comes from fruit bats and animals such as pigs, can cause a lethal, brain-swelling fever in humans.The student started showing fever symptoms on September 4 and died five days later, said R. Renuka, a district medical officer in the town of Malappuram, located in northern Kerala.The testing of a blood sample from the victim sent to the National Institute of Virology in Pune confirmed a Nipah infection on September 9, Renuka said.Five other people who have developed primary symptoms of a Nipah infection have had blood samples drawn and they were sent for tests, she said, without saying if they were primary contacts of the dead person.Nearly 151 people are being monitored for any symptoms after they were found to be on the primary contact list of the victim, who had come from Bengaluru, she said.This is the second death from a Nipah infection in Malappuram this year after a 14-year-old boy succumbed in July.Nipah has been linked to the deaths of dozens of people in Kerala since its first appearance in the state in 2018. \nDusit Princess Kathmandu is organising a five-day trout festival at its SOI restaurant. The dishes will be available for order from 12:30 pm to 10:00 pm every day till August 30. In celebration of Nepal’s rivers and lakes, which provide an ideal environment for high-quality trout, the Director of Culinary Food and Beverage Service, Chef Utpal Mondal, and his team at Dusit Princess Kathmandu have crafted a menu showcasing the flavours and versatility of locally sourced trout. “As the festive month of Shrawan ends, people focus on healthy and nutritious food. Trout, rich in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and essential minerals, offers a heart-friendly option that checks all the boxes from a nutritional and culinary standpoint,” says Mondal.He adds that the goal of the culinary event is to offer their guests a rare opportunity to experience a wide variety of trout dishes they wouldn’t typically find at home.The event menu features twelve unique dishes, six of which are drawn from diverse culinary traditions across continents. Three dishes are inspired by oriental cuisine, while the remaining three highlight flavours from Nepal and India. The menu has been designed to include various dishes, from soups and starters to main courses, including Mexican, Italian, Continental, and Thai flavours.While discussing the event’s highlights, Mondal said, “The celebration presents a unique opportunity for guests to indulge in a diverse range of trout-based dishes, something they wouldn’t typically have the chance to experience elsewhere.” \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result.

They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral, an environment science student, launched her online baking business, Bakeleus, in 2021, featuring a variety of baked goods made with locally sourced ingredients and a zero-waste policy.\nKhokana, a traditional village in Kathmandu Valley, showcases historical architecture, mustard oil mills, and the Sikali Temple, representing a blend of ancient and modern elements amidst the expanding urban jungle.\nAn artist's journey to Everest Base Camp offers lessons in resilience, nature's unpredictability, and the fragile nature of life.\nA group of journalists embarked on a five-day tour of Sri Lanka, exploring religious and cultural sites, including the Sigiriya Rock Fortress, ancient temples, and the ruins of the Dutch-built Galle Fort.\nNew cultural Mundhum Trek provides panoramic Himalayan views; Janaki Mandir celebrates Sita and Ram's marriage; Kuri Village offers winter snow adventures; Annapurna Base Camp trek showcases cultural diversity and stunning scenery; Bardiya National Park hosts Royal Bengal Tigers; Khaptad National Park remains pristine with seasonal treks to an offbeat destination.\nThe author, after a long journey, arrives in his hometown of Phidim, noticing its transformation from a small town to an urban hub with multi-story buildings, paved roads, and a changing demographic.\nGulsan Jha scored a half-century and took five wickets but that was not quite enough to end Nepal’s winless streak as the Rhinos succumbed to a one-wicket defeat against Oman in the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup League 2 in King City on Thursday.The outcome means Nepal have now suffered five losses—four in a row—in six matches and stay in the seventh position in the eight-team League 2 standings. Their only win of the League 2 came in February at the TU Cricket Ground during the inaugural Tri-Series (involving the Netherlands and Namibia) against the Dutch, who now lead the table with 12 points after six wins and two losses.Nepal were looking to bounce back from their first ever one-day international defeat against Canada on Monday and showed some improvements, with their captain Rohit Paudel also finding firm after dismal innings in his previous four outings.Nepal, invited to bat first after losing the toss, made a shaky start to their innings as they lost Arjun Saud (5), who opened in place of out-of-form Kushal Bhurtel, Aasif Sheikh (11) and Bhim Sharki (11) cheaply and were scratching their head at 31-3 after 13.1 overs.But Paudel scored a half-century and rebuilt the innings with Aarif Sheikh, who came to bat first for the first time since Nepal’s second leg loss against the Netherlands in February, to take the total past 100.After Aarif fell to Shakeel Ahmed, who was making his ODI debut, in the 36.3 overs making 35 runs off 88 balls, Paudel departed playing 72-ball 60 that included two fours and four sixes.Jha, promoted to number six, then continued the revival scoring 53 runs off 35 balls. His aggressive knock featured three boundaries and five maximums.Sompal Kami then smashed quick 20 off eight balls at the end to guide Nepal to 220-9 from 50 overs.This was also the first time Nepal have crossed the 200-run mark in the League 2 this edition.In response, Kashyap Prajapati (36 off 52) and Jatinder Singh (41 off 49) added 75 runs for the opening wicket to give Oman a solid start.Sandeep Lamichhane finally ended their stand in the 17th over trapping Singh lbw and Aarif dispatched Prajapati in the 20th over to halt the Oman progress.Jha then returned with the ball and dismissed Oman captain Aqib Ilyas for 29 and Aayan Khan for nine.Karan KC next took the wickets of Pratik Athavale (26) and Khalid Kail (17).Jha then sent back Shoaib Khan (26) and Fayaaz Butt (8), and bowled a maiden over in the 48th over that also included the wicket of Jay Odedra (5), leaving Oman needing 10 runs from the final two overs with one wicket remaining.Karan KC gave away just two runs in the 49th over but Shakeel and Kaleemullah robbed Sompal Kami with two fours to lead Oman to 223-9.Jha finished his 10-over spell with 5-47 that also included two maidens.The victory gave Oman their second win in five matches and put them in sixth position with five points.Nepal next play Canada on Sunday and Oman on Tuesday in the reverse fixtures of the Canada Tri-Series. \nInter Milan escaped Etihad Stadium with a surprise 0-0 draw against Manchester City in the Champions League on Wednesday, exacting a small measure of revenge for their narrow loss to Pep Guardiola’s side in the 2023 final.Both teams squandered numerous chances in a breathless back-and-forth affair. City were largely stalled by Inter’s impressive discipline in defence, while Simone Inzaghi’s Inter, who were dangerous on the break on a nervy night for both sides, were wayward with their finishing.“We faced a really difficult team,” Guardiola said. “I’m still really, really satisfied for the game we played, especially with how (Inter) defended, they are masters of that, so big, they help each other unbelievably. So you cannot expect to create a lot of chances.”Inzaghi was similarly pleased with his squad’s night.“I said ‘well done guys’, they put in a giant performance,” the manager said. “I asked them to play exactly as they did. We all know Manchester City, what they are capable of, we knew we had to pull out all the stops, play a great game and we did it.”City’s goal machine Erling Haaland, who would have become the fastest player in history to record 100 goals for a European club had he scored, will have to wait to achieve that milestone.The Norwegian, who has nine goals in four Premier League games this season, narrowly missed a couple of first-half chances including a header that keeper Yann Sommer jumped up to grab on the line, and a hard, low shot that rolled just wide of the post.Henrikh Mkhitaryan had City fans breathing a huge sigh of relief when he missed a late chance, launching a rocket just over the bar from about eight metres out, then holding his head in disbelief.At the other end, Ilkay Gundogan elicited huge groans from City fans after twice failing to convert with close-range headers in the dying seconds. He launched the first one straight at the keeper, with the second one glancing just over the bar right before the final whistle.City fired 22 shots to Inter’s 13 but only had one more shot on target than their visitors with five.Under the new Champions League format, teams play eight matches against eight different opponents, with the top eight sides in the 36-team league automatically advancing to the last 16, and the next 16 playing a further knockout round.It was a lacklustre performance for four-time defending English champions City, who are in a familiar spot sitting atop the Premier League table after four games with a 100% record. Inter are third in the Serie A table.One negative on the night was a potential injury to City captain Kevin De Bruyne, who appeared to pick up a knock late in the first half and did not play in the second.His team face another intense contest on Sunday when they host Arsenal, who sit two points behind them in the table.City, who edged Inter 1-0 to hoist the 2023 Champions League trophy in Istanbul as part of their treble, were eliminated by eventual winners Real Madrid in the quarter-finals of Europe's top competition last season, while Atletico Madrid ousted Inter in the round of 16. \nNepal Police Club missed their chance to leapfrog Tribhuvan Army Club to the second spot in the ANFA Women’s League after they were held to a goalless stalemate by sixth-placed Chandrapur Municipality at the ANFA Complex in Lalitpur on Wednesday.Police also had to rely on a goalkeeping heroics from Usha Nath to avoid a shock loss late in the game as the goalkeeper saved a penalty kick from Dil Kumari Magar, helping the departmental side preserve their unbeaten run in the league.The draw—second in a row and third in the season—will still have damaging consequences to Police as the outcome left them four points adrift of leaders and reigning champions Armed Police Force Club, who are on 16 points.Police have 12 points from six games.Army occupy second position with 13 points.Police were not at their best and had to wait until the 34th minute to have a clean chance at goal when Niru Thapa outran two Chandrapur defenders to set up Nirmala Upadhyaya inside the penalty area but Chandrapur goalkeeper Usha Thapa reacted quickly to save Upadhyaya’s shot.Niru also set up Anuska Sherpa with a beautiful through pass in the final minute of the first half but Chandrapur goalkeeper Thapa came to the rescue again with her quick thinking.Chandrapur came close to scoring in the injury time of the first half after a poor defending from Samikshya Ghimire allowed Sunita Sunar from an open play but she ended up shooting wide.Police almost found the lead five minutes into the break when Niru’s strike beat Chandrapur’s goalie Usha, who had come far off the post to check Ghim Kumari Gurung’s clever pass, but the shot could not find the target.Chandrapur had a golden chance to punish misfiring Police in the 71st minute from the penalty kick. They were awarded the penalty after Ghimire handled the ball inside the area but Police goalkeeper Nath stretched full length to deny Magar and saved her side from the jaws of defeat.In the later action, Karnali Province registered their first victory of the season with a 3-0 victory against Sudurpaschim Province.Bhumika Budhathoki put Karnali in front in the 24th minute capitalising on an opportunity by Garima Rai, who twisted and turned to outwit Sudurpaschim defenders before putting it on the plate for Budhathoki.Rai then combined with Budhathoki to double Karnali’s lead in the 62nd minute, before Barsha Oli finished off a counter attack to wrap up a comfortable victory.Karnali stayed in the ninth position with four points. Sudurpaschim are rock bottom after facing their sixth defeat in six matches. Bagmati Youth Club play against Waling Municipality on Thursday. \nIsrael bombed southern Lebanon on Thursday and said it had thwarted an Iranian-led assassination plot, a day after explosions of Hezbollah radios that came on the heels of blasts in booby trapped pagers, setting the foes hurtling towards war.The sophisticated attacks on armed group Hezbollah's communications equipment, which killed 37 people and wounded around 3,000 over two days, sowed disarray in Lebanon, with panicked residents abandoning their mobile phones.\"This isn’t a small matter, it’s war. Who can even secure their phone now? When I heard about what happened yesterday, I left my phone on my motorcycle and walked away,\" said Mustafa Sibal on a street near central Beirut.A distant roar in the skies could be heard in Beirut from what Lebanese state media said was Israeli jets breaking the sound barrier - a sound that has grown increasingly common in recent months.Israel said its warplanes struck villages in southern Lebanon overnight, and a security source and Hezbollah's al-Manar TV reported airstrikes near the border resumed on Thursday just after midday.Hand-held radios used by Hezbollah detonated on Wednesday across Lebanon's south. The Lebanese health minister raised the death toll, saying 25 people had been killed and 608 injured in the country's deadliest day since cross-border fighting erupted between the militants and Israel in parallel with the Gaza war last year.The previous day, hundreds of pagers - used by Hezbollah to evade mobile phone surveillance - exploded at once, killing 12 people including two children, and injuring more than 2,300.In a post on X, Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati called on the United Nations Security Council to take a firm stand to stop Israel's \"aggression\" and \"technological war\" against his country.Israel has not commented directly on the booby-trapped walkie-talkies and pagers, but multiple security sources have said the attacks were carried out by its spy agency Mossad.Israel says its conflict with Hezbollah, like its war in Gaza against Palestinian militant group Hamas, is part of a wider regional confrontation with Iran, which sponsors both groups as well as armed movements in Syria, Yemen and Iraq.On Thursday Israeli security forces announced that an Israeli businessman had been arrested last month after attending at least two meetings in Iran, where he discussed assassinating Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the defence minister or the head of the Shin Bet spy agency.Last week, Shin Bet uncovered what it said was a plot by Hezbollah to assassinate former Defence Minister Moshe Ya'alon.Israel has been accused of assassinations including a blast in Tehran that killed the leader of Hamas and another in a Beirut suburb that killed a senior Hezbollah commander within hours of each other in July.Despite the events of the past few days, a spokesperson for the U.N. peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon said the situation along the frontier had \"not changed much in terms of exchanges of fire between the parties\".\"There was an intensification last week. This week it is more or less the same. There are still exchanges of fire. It is still worrying, still concerning, and the rhetoric is high,\" the spokesperson, Andrea Tenenti, told Reuters.Israel and Hezbollah have been exchanging fire across the Israeli-Lebanon border in parallel with the war Israel has waged in Gaza against Hamas, the Palestinian militant group whose fighters attacked Israel on Oct. 7.Tens of thousands of people have had to flee the Israel-Lebanon border area on both sides. Netanyahu vowed on Wednesday to return the evacuated Israelis \"securely to their homes\".SHIFTING FOCUSThe Israeli military said its overnight air strikes hit Hezbollah targets in Chihine, Tayibe, Blida, Meiss El Jabal, Aitaroun and Kfarkela in southern Lebanon, as well as a Hezbollah weapons storage facility in the area of Khiam.Israeli media reported that a number of Israeli civilians had been wounded by anti-tank missile fire from Lebanon, but there was no official confirmation.On Wednesday, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said the war was moving into a new phase, with more resources and military units now being shifted to the northern border.According to Israeli officials, the forces being deployed there include the 98th Division, an elite formation including commando and paratroop elements that has been fighting in Gaza.Hezbollah launched missile barrages on Israel on the day after the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas, and since then there has been a constant exchange of fire that neither side has allowed to escalate into a full-scale war.However, tens of thousands have been evacuated on both sides of the border, and there has been mounting pressure in Israel for the government to get the evacuees back home. \nA Norwegian human rights foundation gave its annual prize on Thursday to jailed Cuban dissident leader Luis Manuel Otero Alcantara for his “fearless opposition to authoritarianism through art”.Four past laureates of the Rafto Prize — Myanmar’s Aung San Suu Kyi, East Timor’s Jose Ramos-Horta, South Korea’s Kim Dae-jung and Iran’s Shirin Ebadi — later went on to win the Nobel Peace Prize.This year’s Peace Prize will be announced on October 11 in Oslo.“The 2024 Rafto prize aims to highlight the importance of the work of Luis Manuel Otero Alcantara and other artists in challenging power structures and defending democracy and human rights, both in Cuba and globally,” the Norwegian foundation said in a statement.A Cuban court sentenced the artist-dissident in 2022 to five years in jail in a high-profile case that human rights groups branded a “farce” but that Cuban state media said was a fair trial over “common crimes.”The 36-year-old artist was a prominent member of the Havana-based San Isidro Movement, an artists collective that led a number of protests over two years. Many of the group have since left Cuba, alleging government repression.On Thursday, the Rafto Foundation called on the Cuban government to release him, joining similar calls by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International.The laureate is awarded a diploma and prize money of $20,000. \nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nWhat animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. \nNepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) \nThere is no doubt that the promulgation of the Constitution of Nepal, 2015, nine years ago, was a significant accomplishment. That was primarily because it represented the realisation of the decades-old national dream of being governed by a constitution drafted by a sovereign body elected by the people of Nepal. Due to its “fast-tracked” provenance, the kind of deliberations that would have granted it much greater legitimacy was sorely missing. Even so, it was a milestone in Nepal’s history.That momentous achievement was, however, marred by the somewhat contradictory turn of events in that it was adopted in the face of opposition by a large section of the populace, particularly from the Tarai. While the royalist Rastriya Prajatantra Party had expectedly voted against the republican and secular constitution, all the Madhesh-based parties had boycotted the proceedings altogether. The main grouse of the latter was the delineation of provincial boundaries, but there were also strong misgivings over the distribution of parliamentary constituencies as well as restrictions on the right of women to pass citizenship to their offspring.The whys and the whereforesWith the political space heating up amidst talk of amending the constitution following the Nepali Congress-UML pact, we appear to be headed for another round of acrimony. As per the two-party agreement, the express purpose of the amendment would be to identify the constitution’s “strengths and weaknesses and complexities that have emerged in practice” which have contributed to Nepal’s chronic political instability. Party leaders have been clear that their main target is the current mixed electoral system, particularly proportional representation (PR), which they are more than quite certain is the primary cause for the never-ending making and breaking of governments. It is a different matter that our own experience from the 1990s clearly indicates otherwise, and other countries that have adopted PR have not been similarly blighted by the kind of instability that has become the hallmark of Nepali politics.Beyond that, given the two parties’ record, there was immediate suspicion that they would try to do away with some of the more progressive elements of the constitution. The Nepali Congress leader, Sher Bahadur Deuba, has in the past hinted secularism could be up for negotiation. And while Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has maintained that any amendment would lead to an even more liberal document, given his earlier stance on issues such as inclusion and devolution of provincial authority, there are reasons aplenty to consider his assertion with a block of salt.Besides the political parties, there have been similar calls from the judicial sector as well. Two prominent recently retired Supreme Court justices who had both served on the court’s constitutional bench have spelt out the need for amendments. Anand Mohan Bhattarai believes that it should begin with the political leadership first identifying where the bottlenecks are. The second jurist, Ishwor Khatiwada, goes further and argues that each and every article of the constitution should be up for review, albeit for the purpose of improving them and not to fulfil the interests of any political party. The latter, obviously, is the crux of the problem. Without doubt, there will be some fiddling with the constitution; it is only a question of when, not if.Self-inquiry before self-interest Now that he is out of office, the Maoist supremo, Pushpa Kamal Dahal Prachanda, has suddenly felt the need to re-embrace the agenda that propelled him to power but which he had lost sight of in his extended romp in the nation’s highest offices. Thus, he says that his party would be amenable to constitutional amendments provided there are no “attempts to shrink the rights of the citizens and dismiss the achievements in the name of the constitution amendment”.Perhaps, it was the still-muted pushback that prompted Deuba to clarify that the provinces would remain, and instead, the focus would be on strengthening the provincial structure. He also said that many groups in the country will have to be provided with proportional representation in governance structure. “This country belongs to everyone,” he said somewhat sagely.The hard sell, of course, will be to the Madhesh-based parties. For instance, the president of the Tarai Madhesh Loktantrik Party, Brikhesh Chandra Lal, writes that the move by the ruling coalition could be a cover for “extreme nationalism” which would ultimately negate sub-national identities. He believes such a move “could increase the possibility of the country getting stuck in a permanent conflict”. Conflict does not necessarily mean violence, but the kind of upheaval Lal warns about will have the same deleterious effect overall. Hence, the need to tread carefully and take all sides into confidence instead of ramming through amendments on the basis of parliamentary strength.I do not think the NC-UML combine would opt for a path of confrontation. Going back to Deuba, we can take heart in his words that there was no need to distrust them since both parties have emerged out of the struggle for democracy. “Personally, I first met him [Oli] in jail. We have both fought for democracy. As parties that fought for democracy throughout our student life and jail experiences, there is no way we can go against democracy.”One can read something in his use of the now-discredited “prajatantra” to refer to democracy instead of the more-favoured “loktrantra”. But it could easily just have been a momentary lapse, attributable to his advanced age.Age did not hamper someone else in lucid expression though. In the summer of 1787, at the end of the rather raucous convention that drafted the American constitution, 81-year-old Benjamin Franklin, by then the elder statesman in the room, made a statement that rings true for all time: “I confess that there are several parts of this constitution which I do not at present approve, but I am not sure I shall never approve them: For having lived long, I have experienced many instances of being obliged by better information, or fuller consideration, to change opinions even on important subjects, which I once thought right, but found to be otherwise. It is therefore that the older I grow, the more apt I am to doubt my own judgment, and to pay more respect to the judgment of others.”Those wise words should guide our politicians even as they begin discussions on changes to the constitution. We can only hope that they are capable of the same humility borne out of a lifetime of self-enquiry that Franklin articulated so eloquently. \nAs a child growing up in the early 1990s, I remember learning in school about the greenhouse effect. Carbon dioxide released by burning fossil fuels traps heat near the Earth’s surface, like the glass of a greenhouse. I imagined myself on the playground, roasting inside a humid hothouse.Fast forward 30 years, and the terms have changed.For a while, “global warming” was the go-to expression for talking about rising global temperatures and the role of human activities, particularly the use of fossil fuels. It had a spike in internet searches in 2007, probably due to former Vice President Al Gore’s documentary “An Inconvenient Truth: A Global Warning,” which hit theatres in 2006.Near the end of the Obama administration, “climate change” became the most common term. It’s now trending in Google searches more than global warming. Both terms make the same point: Rising global temperatures have major consequences on local weather patterns and worldwide climate effects, including stronger hurricanes, droughts, floods and fires.Trending termsGoogle Trends tracks the relative popularity of internet search terms over time. The popularity of the term \"global warming\" has declined globally in recent years, while \"climate change\" has risen.However, the words we use to discuss these effects can make a large difference in how people understand the risks and the need for more sustainable choices.What’s in a name?I’m a linguistics researcher currently living on Mayotte Island, off the coast of Madagascar, where I study climate change knowledge among local populations and the language they use to discuss it.Local fishers in Mayotte struggle to talk about the phenomenon because there is no established terminology for it. What my colleagues and I have learned offers some insight into the difficulties people in many cultures have with understanding climate change.In the grand scheme of climate change education and sustainability efforts, this seemingly minor problem of translation is in fact symptomatic of a larger underlying issue regarding the relationship between humans and their environment.In fact, when we dig deeper into the challenges of communicating climate change across cultures, two factors come into play: spiritual beliefs and notions of time.Spiritual language can overlapSpiritual and religious beliefs can play an important role in how climate change is understood and even named. For example, the translation for the term climate in Inuktitut, an Inuit language spoken in Canada, is “sila.” However, sila also refers to wisdom, the spirit, the earth, and the universe. It is something sacred to be revered.Seen through the lens of this second set of definitions, sila is effectively impossible for people to influence. It is beyond humankind’s reach to change the cosmos. As a result, communication aimed at promoting awareness of climate change becomes politicised in Eastern Canadian Inuit languages.My colleagues and I encountered similar challenges while discussing possible future efforts to slow down environmental destruction caused by climate change in Mayotte.The Maore fishers we interviewed, many of whom were of deep Islamic faith, often responded with “Inshallah,” or God willing, when questioned about efforts the community could make in the future to address the problem. They saw these climate change-related events as out of their hands, as something only God could interfere with.Different understanding of timeSecond, we might think that time is objective and therefore shared across cultures. But as Albert Einstein argued, time is relative.Time is not only relative scientifically speaking but also culturally. For example, the ancient Greeks had more than three types of time, one of which we still use today, Kronos, or linear time—think chronological order. We have all but forgotten Aion, or sacred, eternal time, and Kairos, or cyclical time.Notions of time play an important role when thinking about climate change since the heart of the phenomenon involves a slow, continuous change over a long period. We cannot see climate change happen with the naked eye, because it occurs over years and decades. Of course, we can see its effects on weather patterns, including extreme heat waves and heavy downpours.Getting people to think about time in a way that simultaneously thinks about the now, and a “then” in the distant future proves to be challenging in many cultures.For example, researchers studying sustainability efforts in the Maldives Islands have come up against this very issue. While discussing time, many local residents think in terms of the now and the near future, whereas policymakers must think about longer-term effects on a larger scale. These contrasting approaches to time have made it difficult to put into place sustainability efforts to tackle rising sea levels—a significant threat to this tropical nation of 26 atolls.Translating climate changeA first step to confronting this problem is to put language at the forefront of climate change education efforts.One youth-driven nonprofit making strides in this area is Climate Cardinals. The group’s objective is to translate climate change research into as many languages as possible. Most scientific studies and reports are in English, which can be a barrier to the many non-English speakers around the globe. In their efforts to translate this research and related phenomena, they need to think carefully about how important words are translated and understood.The United Nations and other groups are also starting to take seriously the connection between climate change scepticism and religion, including the need to reconcile eventual points of friction.For example, the Faith for Earth Initiative works with religious organisations to address the compatibility of sustainability efforts and faith. It does this by helping religious leaders connect core spiritual values, like caring and rejection of greed, to the community’s environment, thus reconnecting with nature and seeing themselves as its stewards.Finally, it is imperative to keep studying local or indigenous knowledge about the environment as related to change and time. The ancient Greeks certainly had their reasons for dividing time into multiple categories. So what were the environmental and historical influences that led them to do so?For instance, researchers and community members in Australia are looking to reconcile Indigenous knowledge with Western science. Thanks to the locals’ long-standing observations of their environment over several generations, they were able to identify local effects of climate change. Such information is often overlooked and difficult to obtain by traditional research methods.Beyond the headlinesClimate change awareness and sustainability efforts will only increase over time. Care needs to be taken to how these concepts are lived, understood and talked about in non-Western settings. Language is part and parcel of these efforts and deserves to be considered more carefully.-The Conversation Read the original article here. \nIn the past two weeks, the Federalism and Localisation Centre organised interactive programmes with chief ministers, ministers, political party leaders, principal secretaries and secretaries, and other key officials from Koshi, Madhesh, Bagmati and Gandaki provinces. Today, the Centre is organising a similar programme in Lumbini Province. This article summarises the key insights shared by the chief ministers during these discussions, focusing on three key areas: Provincial government achievements, challenges in federalism, and necessary reforms, including issues related to constitutional amendments.During a session in Pokhara, Chief Minister Surendra Raj Pandey stressed that the federal governance system cannot be effectively institutionalised without a significant shift in the mindset of political leaders. He recounted how he coordinated with then-Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal to convene a meeting of the National Coordination Council in July 2023, but lamented that the meeting yielded no meaningful outcomes. Although the meeting made six decisions to clarify the rights of all three tiers of government, Chief Minister Pandey pointed out that none have been fully implemented.According to him, while former Prime Minister Dahal was genuinely committed to federalism, many other leaders did not share the same dedication. Despite Dahal's commitment, the momentum for federalism stagnated during his tenure, as attempts were made to centralise power instead of promoting federalism. Pandey argued that it is unproductive to blame bureaucrats for the stagnation of federalism; rather, the real issue lies in a lack of political will. He mentioned that although the Madheshi and Maoist parties initially drove the federalism movement, political parties must now clearly articulate their stance if constitutional amendments are needed.Pandey asserted that provinces are the most crucial innovation of federalism, though opposition has emerged due to internal provincial issues and resource allocation. He stated, \"If we fail to deliver services, we must reassess our approach. Criticising us without the chance to perform is unfair. The federal government often does not pass necessary laws, yet we are held accountable.\" Engaging with nearly 100,000 people annually, he highlighted that this is a direct result of federalism. He called for a shift in political attitudes and expressed concern about provincial employees and police not being under provincial control, limiting governance potential.Chief Minister Hikmat Bahadur Karki of Koshi Province shared similar sentiments about the state of federalism in Nepal. He highlighted a concerning trend: Political leaders who once served at the provincial level often forget the challenges provinces face when transitioning to the federal government. \"Many who were once in the provinces during their first term are now at the federal level, but they seem to have forgotten the struggles and concerns of the provinces,\" Karki noted. He also addressed alarming calls to abolish federalism and eliminate provinces, attributing such views to a centralised mindset.Karki urged those drafting the constitution to take responsibility for its implementation, emphasising the need to prioritise federalism and constitutional reinforcement. He dismissed claims that integrating civil servants and police into the provincial system is impossible, warning that undermining federalism could lead to renewed conflict. \"If federalism is abolished, a new constitution may emerge, but it will only push Nepal towards further turmoil,\" Karki cautioned. Instead of dismantling the current federal structure, he advocated for addressing its flaws, noting that provinces operate with limited authority that must be expanded.Karki questioned the need for 25 federal ministries, suggesting that only essential ones like the Prime Minister’s Office, Finance, Defense, Home Affairs and Foreign Affairs should remain at the federal level. He criticised the disparity in resource allocation, noting that 80 percent of government employees are at the federal level, while the combined budgets of all seven provinces fall short of a single federal ministry's budget. To address this, he proposed a revenue-sharing model, with the federal government receiving 30 percent of revenue and provinces and local governments each receiving 35 percent. Karki expressed dissatisfaction with the Fiscal Commission's performance, stating it has not followed the constitutional spirit. He also highlighted the challenges of administrative federalism, where many civil servants resist transfers. Despite these issues, Karki acknowledged progress in infrastructure development but lamented the lack of communication and advocacy for federalism. In Madhesh Province, there is a growing recognition that meaningful federalism can only be realised if the federal government allows provinces to exercise the rights guaranteed by the constitution. Concerns have been raised about the federal government's reluctance to grant constitutional rights to provincial governments under various pretexts, hindering the institutionalisation of federalism.During a dialogue on strengthening federalism held in Janakpur, Chief Minister Satish Kumar Singh highlighted positive developments in sectors such as education, health and infrastructure since the establishment of federalism. He cited these advancements as having significantly transformed the rural landscape of Madhesh, underscoring the tangible benefits of provincial governance.Despite limited rights and resources, Singh highlighted the provincial government’s commitment to establishing essential infrastructure and mechanisms for the benefit of the people. He noted that the effective roles played by provincial and local governments during the Covid-19 pandemic were crucial in saving countless lives. Singh cautioned that relying solely on the federal government during such crises would have led to dire consequences, further reinforcing the importance and relevance of federalism.While acknowledging that the rights granted to provinces are insufficient, Singh said that the provincial government has shown its presence by undertaking necessary tasks even in areas beyond its jurisdiction. For instance, despite lacking authority over basic education, the provincial government has initiated school infrastructure development. He highlighted the critical issue of the teacher-student ratio in Madhesh Province, where one teacher serves 40 to 45 students, compared to the standard of one for every 20 to 22 in the hills, raising concerns about education quality.Singh noted that 80 percent of government employees are concentrated in Singha Durbar, fostering a perception that provincial workers are penalised. He criticised the federal government's maintenance of 25 ministries, arguing that only five to seven are necessary, especially with existing provincial ministries. Singh stressed the importance of addressing flawed practices while advocating for provincial rights. He warned that if actions undermine the future of federalism, Madhesh Province would not remain silent. Calling for unity among political parties against attempts to weaken federalism, he emphasised that collaborative efforts are essential for strengthening governance in Nepal.Chief Minister Bahadur Singh Lama of Bagmati Province expressed serious concerns about the ongoing challenges the provincial government faces, particularly due to the lack of control over police administration. He underscored that a government without effective police oversight is fundamentally flawed. \"While a government may exist, its significance diminishes without a functional police administration,\" he stated.The relationship between the federal and provincial governments has been strained for some time, especially regarding police integration and civil service legislation. In light of these challenges, Bagmati Province has proactively constructed police facilities and established relevant laws. However, unresolved issues surrounding police integration continue to hinder effective governance. He acknowledged that while some changes have occurred since the implementation of federalism, they do not align with citizens' expectations. \"The hopes and desires of the people are substantial; however, managing these aspirations with current resources presents significant challenges,\" he explained. Chief Minister Lama assured attendees that the provincial government is prioritising issues outlined in the list of exclusive rights mandated by the constitution, stating, \"To date, we have enacted 80 laws that address the needs of our province.\"Lama emphasised the urgent need for improved coordination among provincial, federal, and local governments, identifying this as a primary challenge. \"Developing the necessary laws to facilitate effective collaboration among the three tiers of government is essential. Failure to do so will lead to public dissatisfaction.\"The insights shared by the chief ministers highlight the urgent need for reforms in Nepal's federal system. While progress has been made, significant challenges remain. \nWhenever there is a discussion about rural development in Nepal, access to quality education always emerges as an obvious solution, yet its implementation has often been grossly neglected. This is evident in the fact that schools in Nepal’s rural areas have for years been grappling with a shortage of qualified teachers. A recent Post report highlights how the education of students in Araniko Technical Secondary School, Dasharath Secondary School, and Jananamuna Secondary School in Karnali Province have been compromised due to the lack of qualified teachers for basic and secondary-level science and maths students. Such issues occasionally make headlines; however, little has been done to minimise the education gap. Although this is a problem in various provinces, Karnali’s community schools have suffered the most. Data from the education planning, data and research branch of the Social Development Ministry of Karnali Province shows that 626,010 students have enrolled in community schools in the province. However, of the 8,793 primary teacher positions, 644 are vacant. Further, in the lower secondary and secondary levels, 2,699 and 1,749 posts remain unfulfilled.The rural municipalities in the neighbouring Sudurpaschim province seem to be handling the problem by hiring lower-level and underqualified teachers to teach secondary-level students. This only masks the problem as the teachers won’t be able to deliver what the subject demands. In most cases, there is a lack of science, maths, and English teachers. These are major subjects that demand proper lessons and shouldn’t be taught only for the sake of teaching. However, these schools have limited options as teachers qualified to teach science and maths opt for civil service and secure a government job as they do not see teaching in rural areas as a promising career. According to the Education Development and Coordination Unit, Myagdi, seven science teachers left teaching to join the civil service in 2022. The problem stems from the government’s failure to realise that teacher availability is vital for improving education. There are little to no incentives for teachers in rural areas. Qualified teachers feel less secure in their contract-based jobs in rural areas and are compelled to move to the cities for better opportunities. Even if the teachers join contract-based positions in remote areas, they leave feeling demotivated and undervalued. Seeing the poor teaching and learning conditions in rural schools, students migrate to get a better education. The lack of teachers has, in turn, led to the lack of students in some schools. According to the Ministry of Social Development, Karnali, there are fewer than 10 students in 137 community schools in the province. There is also a growing tendency among teachers to take tuition classes rather than teach in schools as they earn more from that. Due to the distrust of schools, parents in remote areas send their children to neighbouring towns and cities for tuition. This becomes more noticeable during the Secondary Education Examination. During this year’s SEE, over 500 grade 10 students across Bajhang were studying in tuition centres, leading to a lack of students in schools and the cancellation of classes. With the inability of our education system to bridge the gap between rural and urban education, the poor SEE results should not be a surprise. The students mirror the teaching they get, just as teachers reflect the conditions they work under. So a change in existing policies for hiring teachers is warranted. More efforts should be made to retain qualified teachers in rural areas and discourage private tuition. We cannot expect better output from students unless they have good and enough teachers in their schools.  \nIt is no secret that we are taking in chemicals-laced fruits and vegetables into our kitchens and bodies. But the Nepali government reports progress, suggesting most of the food we consume might be safe. Last year, the Department of Food Technology and Quality Control tested over 63,000 samples and found only 37 of them positive for pesticides. A similar report from the Central Agriculture Laboratory indicated that 8,503 of 8,575 samples tested for carbamate and organophosphate pesticide residues were safe for consumption.These reports are far from comforting, as they include tests only for a limited number of pesticides. In reality, pesticide imports have more than doubled in the past five years in Nepal, from 169,360 kilograms in 2017-18 to 354,358 kilograms in 2022-23. According to Kantipur, a sister publication of this paper, nine kinds of pesticides are registered in Nepal. Among them, seven kinds are imported. While hundreds of pesticides fall under these groups, only two—residues of insecticide from the carbamate and organophosphate—are tested in the government’s laboratory. The rest are left untested and unregulated. Such negligence from the authorities and from farmers who knowingly or unknowingly use insecticides and pesticides has endangered people’s lives. Heavy use of pesticides leads to severe health problems. The living examples of this are the residents of Gorkha Gandaki Rural Municipality in Gandaki Province. Sixty-one people in the place are fighting cancer, and 15 more are suffering from kidney failure. People in other districts are also struggling with the immediate health effects of pesticides (dizziness, tiredness, heart attack, vomiting, headache, among others) as well as long-term effects (cancer, retarded body growth, inborn disability, etc.). The state cannot shun its responsibility to protect the lives of its citizens; the right to health is their fundamental right, too. There have been measures like declaring Karnali as an “organic province” six years ago. Yet, chemical fertilisers banned, farmers in the province were given no alternatives like organic compost and plant fertilisers to grow enough healthy crops and vegetables. Nor were there laboratories and manpower to test if the foods being produced were really organic. As yields dwindled, people became even more dependent on chemical-laden foods imported from India. The organic project, which could have been a model for the country, was instead a dismal failure. If the use of pesticides continues, a nationwide public health crisis is not far off. The examination of foods for the heck of it must stop. If the authorities really want to work in favour of consumers, they must test for a wider range of pesticides in the food imported via the open border. There must also be more labs to test these products in local units. As important is allocating more technicians for this work, which even our few laboratories lack. All these measures seem a little too much to ask but they are all worth pursuing in the long run. At stake are the health and wellbeing of millions of Nepali. Experts also highlight the lack of knowledge and awareness among farmers about the use of pesticides—and local levels can play a key role in making them aware of their downsides. The more we educate them, the better we control the use of chemicals. \nFormer Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister and current chair of the Rastriya Swatantra Party Rabi Lamichhane has desperately tried to evade responsibility for his role in the misappropriation of cooperatives funds. Yet the mounting pile of evidence suggests his clear culpability. The parliamentary special probe committee was specifically formed to look into his involvement in the siphoning of money from various cooperatives into the Gorkha Media Network, of which he was the Managing Director. If the feelers coming from the committee members are any sign, Lamichhane will be held accountable for his crime. Yet corruption in Nepal is not limited to Lamichhane or his party. If Lamichhane deserves to be investigated and, if found guilty, punished, so should members of any other political party, irrespective of the positions they occupy. Credible evidence has emerged of the involvement of Dhan Raj Gurung, the Nepali Congress Vice-president, in the embezzlement of funds from a Lalitpur-based cooperative. Gurung reportedly helped his ex-wife, Joyti Gurung, embezzle around Rs12.5 million. Similarly, there are accusations that Risikesh Pokharel, the CPN-UML leader who is also the chair of Parliament’s Public Accounts Committee also helped his wife, Anjala Koirala, embezzle as much as Rs120 million from a Morang-based cooperative. What is interesting about the cases against the senior Congress and the UML leaders is the state’s apparent collusion in shielding the two. For instance, the operators of Miteri Savings and Loan Cooperative had filed complaints against 11 people, including Gurung, for misappropriating funds. But the Bagmati Province government has excluded his name in the list of the possible culprits it has sent to the Central Bureau of Investigation of Nepal Police. (The province has Bahadur Singh Lama of the Congress as its chief minister.) Likewise, the Cooperative Registrar Office of the Koshi Province has excluded the name of Anjala Koirala in the list it has forwarded to the police. This is even though the victims of the cooperative had flagged her as one of the operators involved in fund embezzlement. (Koshi province has Hikmat Kumar Karki of the UML as its chief minister.) How seemingly the whole state apparatus is being employed to shield the political leaders from the two ruling parties is shocking. No wonder the government is facing allegations of bias and vindictiveness. On Saturday, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli spent much time fulminating against the Maoist Centre, new political forces, the royalists of various hues as well as Kathmandu's mayor. Yet there was little in terms of introspection. How does he expect people to take either him or his government seriously when it is seen as protecting the corrupt and the compromised people? Rather than making big promises, Oli and his government would be better served if they are seen to be fairly applying the rule of the land and working in public interest. The cooperatives crisis is assuming alarming proportions. It has the potential to do serious damage to the national economy—besides adding untold miseries to hundreds of thousands of poor cooperatives victims who stand to lose everything if prompt measures are not taken to bring fraudulent cooperatives operators to book. If the Oli government plays with the cooperatives’ fire, it could find itself engulfed in the inferno.  \nNepal is marking its ninth Constitution Day on Thursday. The country’s two largest parties—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—formed a coalition government a month ago with a commitment to reviewing and amending the constitution. In this context, Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal and Binod Ghimire sat down with constitutional expert Purna Man Shakya to discuss the good and bad aspects of the constitution amendment process.The Congress and the UML have floated a proposal to amend the constitution. Is the time ripe to make changes in our statute?Generally, constitutions are reviewed after around a decade of their implementation. So, we have come to the stage of reviewing whether our constitution has functioned properly. However, the sudden announcement of the amendment is premature, as this is a serious business. In our case, the constitution can’t be amended just based on the interest of one or two parties. It requires a national consensus. There should be an understanding among the political parties represented in Parliament. And, a sort of consensus even among the people’s level is important as there was huge public involvement in making this constitution. Sentiment of various communities must be respected while making any changes in the national charter. What can be the modality of seeking consensus at the people’s level? Should a draft be prepared and opened up for debate?While making changes in the constitution, some issues might be technical and not of interest to common people. But if any changes are made in policy issues that can alter our country’s structural dynamics, the concerned communities must be consulted. Just the present strength of the political parties represented in Parliament is no guarantee that they truly represent people. For instance, the Maoists emerged as the largest party through the election in 2008. But it has been shrunk to a distant third in the House. However, we can’t conclude from this that the people have discarded the party’s agenda. The Maoists might have been discredited due to their activities and failure in delivery but people might still favour the agenda they once championed. Similar is the case with other parties. Therefore, we have to consider broader consensus both in Parliament as well as the people’s level.How challenging is it to enter the constitution amendment process?Any amendment calls for a two-thirds majority in the House of Representatives as well as the National Assembly in the federal parliament. If an issue is linked to provincial authority, it should be endorsed by the majority [four] of seven provinces. So, this is not easy. Therefore, the parties should tread carefully.You mentioned earlier that constitution amendments without a review process is not a right step. Could you elaborate?The right way is to first have broad understanding among the top leaders of political forces on the issues and then constitute a panel of experts to conduct a comprehensive study on that. Such studies are conducted through two methods—doctrinal and non-doctrinal. The doctrinal method analyses related literature and principles on theoretical approach while the non-doctrinal method studies the public sentiments and opinions through surveys and interactions, and comes up with certain methodologies with the help of subject experts. Through such study, the experts identify the issues and recommend the ways to the politicians. This is the right process.There are also arguments that reviewing the constitution without even bringing it into full-fledged implementation is wrong. Based on the practice during these years, we have concluded that certain provisions didn’t work properly. It is true that we are talking about making changes in the constitution without even implementing certain provisions. First we have to give the system an opportunity to work in a full-fledged way. Then, we can evaluate whether it worked. Any move to dissolve the system without properly implementing it will create divisions and invite another conflict. A question that is often asked: Is there a problem with our constitution or with our politicians? People can change the constitution but the constitution can’t change the people. Therefore, a constitution should be developed also on the basis of the nature of people in the country who use it. If our political parties and the politicians had reformed themselves, we might not have had to discuss constitutional changes time and again. We should have made the system strong for more effective checks and balances and made leaders and officials more accountable. The ruling parties reason that the constitution amendment became necessary to ensure political stability.When a federal government is changed, its aftershocks are immediately seen in all seven provincial governments. It directly impacts development and other activities across the country. It’s a flaw in our party system but we have to find a solution in the system. We see people raising voices for two things—stability and retirement of old politicians. As Nepali politicians never retire voluntarily, we have to address it through the system. Direct election of executive head can be one way to address this problem. People have found local governments more effective than federal and provincial governments. It is because chiefs and representatives of local governments are directly elected and they can serve the full five-year term.Once people are given the right to elect heads of government, they won’t elect old faces such as KP Oli, Sher Bahadur Deuba and Prachanda [Pushpa Kamal Dahal], who have been tested multiple times. It will serve two purposes—first, it gives stability and second, it allows popular leaders to emerge in place of the old ones. The old leaders have maintained control over national politics through their huge party organisations. But when people directly elect presidents and chief ministers their grip over party organisations can’t be decisive in national politics. For that we have to amend the constitution.However, again, an expert team needs to thoroughly study the pros and cons of such changes. But what I can say based on the general study of public perception is that we can first go for direct election of executive heads at the provincial level. In the next phase we can go for direct presidential election at the federal level.What went wrong in the practice of the three-tier federal system?While adopting federalism, the basic idea was to allow the local governments to oversee local matters while the provincial governments would handle wide ranges of issues related to agriculture, industry, forest, education and health, etcetera. If the two sub-national governments handle these things, people don’t need to come to the centre seeking solutions to their problems. In such a scenario, the federal government can focus on important affairs such as foreign relations, defence, telecommunication, currency, national infrastructure projects and inter-provincial affairs. Such division of powers would automatically create specialisation in the respective governments.But the federal system is not implemented as per that spirit. Provinces aren’t allowed to exercise their rights. People are still travelling to Kathmandu all the way from remote districts even for basic things. The constitution has mandated the provinces to maintain law and order in their respective provinces but the federal government hasn’t allowed them to have their own police forces. Provinces without police have become like administrative units. The centre has a huge bureaucracy in Kathmandu. It is high time that the centre delegates authority to provinces as per the constitutional spirit. Federal lawmakers have huge interest in local development activities because it is directly related to their election. They don’t want to lose this influence. The interest of federal lawmakers however contradicts with the constitution.There is also a belief that the local level has authority in areas where they can’t work effectively, for instance they are mandated to oversee the education system up to grade 12 while provinces don’t have much role. Do you think such jurisdictional matters need to be reviewed and provinces should be given more authority?That’s right. First of all, we should be clear that there is no point in adopting a federal system if we don’t want provinces because we had central and local levels even in the past. Provincial layer is an integral part of federalism. So, we have to think about transferring certain rights from local to provincial level because the local units don’t have expertise to oversee education up to grade 12 on their own. Our local units are traditionally trained in local development activities. But now they are entrusted with the responsibility of not only overseeing education and health issues but also with legislative and judicial functions. They haven’t been able to play that role. We should think about transferring some roles from local to provincial levels. Likewise, the centre should be ready to allow the provinces to exercise their rights bestowed by the constitution. It is time to strengthen the provinces.You said direct election of executive heads in provinces could end instability at the provincial level. But what if a popular leader got elected chief minister but other political parties won majority seats in the provincial assemblies? In such a situation, the rival parties may not help the chief minister pass a budget or policies from the assembly.Yes, there are strengths and weaknesses of all systems. Such problems can be resolved because we see similar situations in other countries as well. Parties can’t prolong the deadlock in the House because they will be blamed for the impasse. One basis is that our local units are doing well under executive heads. So, we can practise it for a decade in the provinces and then apply it to the federal level based on that experience.Many forces and groups that aren’t happy with the present constitution, which was basically a compromise document. Once the constitution amendment process is open, they are certain to revive their demands. Will the situation be manageable?If the rights of historically marginalised communities are curtailed, they will certainly retaliate. If you try to go against the federal republic system and policy of inclusion, it may invite new conflicts. The proportional representation system is not a problem. Leaders made it unpopular by misusing it. We should find solutions to stop its misuse. We shouldn’t forget that this constitution is not only a constitution but also a key document of our peace process. This is not perfect but it was essential to end the conflict. Many say that while making a document of compromise, our constitution hasn’t followed the principles of constitutionalism. For instance, the hearing system is something unusual in a parliamentary system. As a constitutional expert, do you think we should also think about fixing such deviations?You are right. When we couldn’t change the people, we tried to add additional features as a measure to check the wrongdoings. Our leaders make appointments in key constitutional bodies guided by their personal and partisan interests. We copied the hearing practice from the presidential system with a view to check the leaders’ arbitrary appointments. It hasn’t been that effective. Therefore, we have proposed to give continuity to the hearing for political appointments but not in the appointments of judges because lawmakers don’t have the expertise to examine judges’ competence. Since lawmakers are mainly guided by the party’s whip and top leaders’ instructions, it rather increases political interference even in the judiciary. We have thus proposed to stop the hearing process for judges’ appointments.Many say that the judiciary hasn’t been federalized even though all other sectors have been restructured as per the three-tier federal system. Why this exception for the judiciary?Oh, you dragged me to a sensitive topic. One thing we shouldn’t forget is that we adopted a federal system not to unify small countries. We were already a united country. We adopted it to better manage our social diversity by involving all the communities in the governing system. We at the same time have to safeguard the country from disintegration. Judiciary, the national army and Nepali language are our institutional arrangements that can play a unifying role. Therefore, we didn’t make much changes in these three aspects.Some instances show that Nepal’s federalism might have been a bit more effective had the judiciary worked proactively. For instance, the court hasn’t decided even the cases filed by provinces years ago. What do you think about the judiciary’s role in this connection?Yes, those cases are still undecided. In the Constituent Assembly, the Maoist party had registered a proposal to form a separate constitutional court. The justices who were leading the judiciary at the time opposed the idea. It was later rejected. Then the idea to have a separate constitutional bench was included as a compromise deal. But it has failed to work effectively. It failed to decide election-related disputes. We have to review its jurisdiction. They have decided certain cases when there is public pressure. For instance they decided cases like House dissolution because there was constant public scrutiny. But they haven’t shown any interest in other important cases where constitutional interpretation is needed. Of late, a strong opinion is being built in favour of forming a separate constitutional court. These issues are being discussed seriously. This issue may emerge if the constitution amendment process begins.What we can infer from your analysis is that the constitution amendment process is not that easy. What are the basic things that should be and can be done in the constitution amendment at this stage?First, we should change the form of governance at the provincial level and go for a directly elected executive head. With this there will be no change in government in provinces after changes at the centre. The governments in provinces can work for five years with certainty. Second, we can transfer the powers that the local units have failed to exercise to provinces. And, the centre should allow the provinces to exercise the concurrent rights. By doing this the centre can reduce the overwhelming burden on it. While the provinces can play an implementing role, the federation can play a supervisory role. These things need to be fixed. We need some amendments to the constitution and some new laws for this. \nNepal has often earned global recognition for its progressive policies and inclusive stance on LGBTQIA+ rights. But do the global accolades Nepal has earned in terms of its progressiveness reflect the actual experiences of queer people here? The Post’s Aarati Ray sat down with Manisha Dhakal, executive director of the Blue Diamond Society and a leading advocate for LGBTQIA+ rights in South Asia for over 23 years.Nepal is often hailed for its progressive stance on queer rights, both in South Asia and globally. With over two decades of queer rights advocacy, how accurate do you find this portrayal?Many activists and commentators do describe Nepal as being progressive on queer rights. While this is partly true, especially when we consider the legal frameworks, the reality at the grassroots is quite different. On the one hand, Nepal’s constitution recognises LGBTQIA+ identities. Articles 12 and 18 mandate that “gender identity” be acknowledged on citizenship certificates, while Article 42 promises affirmative action and participation in government for sexual and gender minorities. Court decisions in Nepal, too, have been favourable for LGBTQIA+ rights, and unlike many former British colonies with Section 377-type laws that criminalise queer communities, Nepal has no such legal barriers. So, indeed, there are opportunities for activism, and progress has been made, particularly in terms of legal recognition. But, again, the rights enshrined in the constitution and affirmed by the courts have not been realised at the grassroots level. We are stuck with a limited focus, primarily on citizenship. The state claims that we’ve been given the right to identity and legal recognition, but even this is not fully realised. For example, the process of obtaining citizenship based on self-identification remains difficult, with government officials still unclear on how to implement these provisions. The broader narrative of Nepal being progressive is built on a superficial understanding of the situation.In August, Nepal’s Supreme Court ruled that Rukshana Kapali, a transgender woman, should be legally recognised as a woman on all documents without medical verification. How does this decision impact the future of LGBTQIA+ rights in Nepal?Rukshana’s case is a prominent victory, highlighting the judiciary’s support for LGBTQIA+ rights, especially compared to those of the executive and legislative branches. This ruling lays a strong foundation for similar future cases and will undoubtedly help in future activism. However, it’s important to note that the decision applies only to Kapali, meaning others will still need to go through the courts to have their gender identity legally recognised. How long must transgender individuals continue to endure lengthy court processes just to obtain citizenship?Even outside the courts, the bureaucratic hurdles—from medical reassignment surgeries to invasive checkups and long delays from the CDO (District Administration Office) to the Ministry of Home Affairs—can take years, with no guarantee of getting preferred names on legal documents. In many cases, even after completing the process, the names are inaccurately changed, such as altering Ram to Rama instead of the preferred name, like Manisha.We [Blue Diamond Society] get 15-20 complaints each year, primarily from transgender women, regarding difficulties in obtaining citizenship.The Supreme Court’s recent decision on same-sex marriage in Nepal has attracted global attention and gotten a positive response. Are there any limits to the court’s decision?After a long and arduous process, we secured temporary registration for same-sex marriages. On June 28, 2023, the Supreme Court, in the Pinky Gurung vs. Government of Nepal case, issued an interim order instructing the government to temporarily register same-sex marriages, including for those with “other” gender markers. That said, the Civil Code adopted in 2017 still defines marriage as a union between a ‘man’ and a ‘woman’.We, as a community, are pleased with the government’s temporary registration process. Yet it falls short of offering full marriage rights, including those related to property, adoption, and tax exemptions. While the court’s decision sets a supportive precedent, lack of clarity about the rights associated with the temporary certificate leaves many in limbo. So far, only around five couples have registered, and many in the community are hesitant to do so.The question remains: Can this temporary registration truly grant us the same recognition as heterosexual marriages? While the decision has garnered global praise, the LGBTQIA+ community on the ground continues to feel cheated of true equality. Our ultimate goal is to amend the Civil Code so that marriage is defined as a union between two individuals, rather than being restricted to one between male and female.Why do many court decisions on queer rights in Nepal, like of same-sex marriages, remain in limbo? Is this due to the government and courts trying to appease both conservative and progressive groups, or is it just a performative gesture of inclusivity?There are multiple factors at play. I think some responsibility also falls on activists. For example, when fighting for legal recognition since 2008, we should have advocated not only for the “third gender” or “other” but also for individuals who have transitioned from male to female or female to male. What’s more, policymakers and bureaucrats still lack awareness about human rights principles related to minority groups like the LGBTQIA+ community. Even though Nepal has ratified international conventions on human rights, these commitments have not been prioritised by lawmakers, which leads to this state of limbo and half-hearted inclusivity.As for the internal thought processes of bureaucrats and lawmakers, it’s hard to say. Many of them might still believe that the LGBTQIA+ community shouldn’t be granted full rights, so they engage in performative actions—appearing supportive on the surface to attract global attention but hesitating to fully advance our rights. This could explain why progress seems to stall midway.Queer rights have received some legal recognition. But how are they reflected in terms of social and cultural acceptance in Nepal?Legal changes and social acceptance need to go hand in hand. If we only focus on legal reforms without addressing societal attitudes, there will be no real change. We’ve seen this play out—there is legal recognition of gender identity, and temporary registration for same-sex marriage is available. Yet people struggle to fully realise these rights because of deep-rooted discrimination within families and society.In Nepal, a socially and culturally driven society, where family, relatives, and festivals play a major role, social acceptance is often more important than legal acceptance. When it comes to cultural acceptance, biases still persist. For example, it feels like we’re allowed to express ourselves openly only during the Pride Month in June. When we try to participate in other celebrations like Teej or Gaijatra, society often reacts negatively, asking why we need to “spoil” their festivals. This shows that social change is still lagging, despite the progress in legal rights.You mentioned that the queer community is often given the surface level of legal recognition. How is the state of the exercise of fundamental rights for LGBTQIA+ people in Nepal?Labelled as ‘gender and sexual minorities’, our broader struggles are ignored. When we raise concerns about poverty, food insecurity, or unemployment, the response we often get from government institutions and stakeholders is, “This isn’t our issue; it’s a gender problem.”We are just as much a part of society as anyone else. Issues like climate change, housing, and poverty affect us too. We want to be included in solutions, whether it’s participating in climate programs or being involved in community initiatives. Unfortunately, lawmakers and stakeholders often overlook that we are just as human as heterosexuals, with needs that go beyond legal recognition on paper.What are some aspects of the queer community that have not received enough attention in media narratives, and what tends to be unnecessarily highlighted?As I’ve mentioned before, the narrative surrounding our community often focuses heavily on issues like citizenship, while overlooking other important aspects of our lives. What’s missing is the correct representation of our contributions in various fields. Many LGBTQIA+ individuals are doctors, and experts in different professions, yet their accomplishments are only rarely acknowledged or represented. Instead, the focus often falls on the unfortunate image of some members of the community begging on the streets, which goes viral on social media.Another issue is the way we are predominantly associated with sex and sexuality. While these are important aspects of human identity, we are much more than that. We have other needs and rights that deserve attention. Unfortunately, the media tends to fixate on sexual aspects of the LGBTQIA+ community, reinforcing stereotypes. It’s time for the media to move beyond this narrow portrayal and include us in broader discussions that reflect the full scope of our lives.How has the current narrative of progressiveness in Nepal impacted real change for the LGBTQIA+ community?It’s time to move beyond this narrative of progressiveness. True progress should lead to further development, not be a barrier to it. Unfortunately, the current narrative seems to be stagnating.For instance, when we raise issues with the government, the response often is, “We’ve already given you the right to citizenship. You’re getting citizenship now.” Even when I travel people sometimes ask, “You’ve got citizenship, right? Things are becoming progressive.” This narrative of progressiveness has become an excuse for the government to claim they’ve done enough and to avoid further action.This surface-level progressiveness is used to showcase Nepal as forward-thinking internationally, but it hasn’t translated into real change for people at the grassroots. It also impedes activists’ efforts by providing the government with a shield against criticism. Until this narrative of progressiveness evolves into genuine, accountable action that goes beyond court decisions and performative gestures, it will continue to be a barrier to actual progress. \nNepal recently amended its Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act, complying with 95% of the Supreme Court's directives, addressing concerns from the international community, and aiming to complete the peace process.\nIncreasing road accidents in Nepal result from inadequate infrastructure, unqualified drivers, reckless driving, lack of lane discipline, outdated technology, haphazard road construction, government negligence, and jurisdictional disputes.\nAfter the CPN-UML split in 2021, CPN (Unified Socialist) leader Ram Kumari Jhakri advocates for party unification due to the new party's poor performance caused by a lack of youth representation, ineffective leadership, and absence of a clear national agenda.\nLight to moderate rainfall with thunderstorms likely in parts of Koshi and Bagmati provinces, along with sporadic rainfall in other hilly areas due to monsoon influence.\nOn Wednesday Lumbini, Karnali and Sudur Pashchim Province along with the hilly regions of the country will remain partly to generally cloudy.

Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nAmid opposition from two lawmakers, the Parliamentary Hearing Committee endorsed 16 of the 17 ambassadorial nominees on Thursday.Lawmakers from the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal (JSP-Nepal) and the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) registered their differing views over four nominees—Kapil Shrestha, Netra Prasad Timilsina, Dhan Prasad Pandit, and Shankar Prasad Sharma, ambassadorial nominees for South Africa, Malaysia, Israel, and India, respectively, but the committee endorsed them through a majority vote.Twelve nominees were unanimously endorsed.In his written opposition to the nominations, Dol Prasad Aryal of the RSP mentioned that all four nominees, who faced various allegations during the hearings, should not be appointed as they do not hold the high moral standards set by the constitution.On Shrestha, Aryal pointed to Article 248 (8) of the constitution, which bars former chairpersons and commissioners of the National Human Rights Commission from being appointed to other government positions.Shrestha lacks the high moral ground, said Aryal in his differing opinion registered in the House committee. He argued that such decisions will pave the way for appointing individuals with questionable morality in the future as well.In Pandit’s case, Aryal claimed that he was fined Rs15,000 by a court after Pandit was found hiding information, therefore he should not be appointed as ambassador. Aryal said considering persons of questionable moral conduct for such high-profile appointments would be a violation of the constitution. Similarly, Aryal raised concerns about Timilsina, the ambassadorial nominee for Malaysia, who has an ongoing court case against the government.A complaint was filed against Timilsina in the House committee where he was accused of misusing the letter head of the Nepal Red Cross Society when he was the chairman. But Aryal did not express any reservations about Sharma, who is proposed for India. Lawmakers from both the ruling and opposition parties were divided over the nominations, but consensus could not be reached as Aryal and Adhikari were firm in their opposition.The government had recommended Naresh Bikram Dhakal (Saudi Arabia), Prof Dr Kapilman Shrestha (South Africa), Prof Dhana Prasad Pandit (Israel), Ram Krishna Bhattarai (Sri Lanka), Sanil Nepal (Spain), and Dr Shail Rupakheti (Germany) for ambassadorial positions.Initially, Kanta Rijal was nominated for Australia, but later replaced by Chitra Lekha Yadav. Incumbent Foreign Secretary Sewa Lamsal has been recommended for the European Union and Brussels, but these nominations have yet to be sent to the Parliamentary Hearing Special Committee.Other nominees include Lok Darshan Regmi (USA), Chandra Kumar Ghimire (UK), Shiva Maya Tumbahangphe (South Korea), Junga Bahadur Chauhan (Russia), Ramesh Chandra Poudel (Qatar), Prof Dr Krishna Prasad Oli (China), Dr Sumnima Tuladhar (Denmark), Dr Netra Prasad Timilsina (Malaysia), Prakash Mani Pokhrel (Portugal) and Rita Dhital (Pakistan). Taking exception to the nominations, the hearing committee on September 9 summoned Foreign Minister Arzu Rana and questioned why the government failed to make the appointments inclusive.On July 29, the government had nominated 17 ambassadors and recalled several others. But the nominations were criticised for failing to honour the spirit of inclusiveness.Meanwhile, Prakash Adhikari of the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal (JSP-Nepal) has registered a written objection against Sharma, Timilsina, Shrestha and Pandit stating that Article 282(2) requires ambassadorial appointment to be inclusive. He said current nominations have not accommodated Madhesi, Dalit, Tharu, Muslim and other clusters.On Sharma, Adhikari said that his appointment violates the spirit of the ambassadorial appointment directive of 2075 BS. Aryal of the RSP and Adhikari of the JSP shared similar concerns about three other nominees.The committee postponed the endorsement of Ramkrishna Bhattarai, the proposed ambassador to Sri Lanka, citing unavailability of his bachelor’s degree certificate.“We have instructed him [Bhattarai] to submit the required documents,” said Ishawri Neupane, the chairman of the hearing committee.The government’s nominations have drawn widespread criticism for allegedly neglecting inclusivity and established criteria for such positions. Kanta Rijal, who had been proposed as ambassador to Australia, was recalled due to performance concerns during her previous term in Israel. Subsequently, the government nominated former lawmaker Chitra Lekha Yadav in her place.Ambassadors nominated by the government are appointed by the President after they are endorsed by the parliamentary hearing committee.The nominations were approved with the support of the opposition party, CPN (Maoist Centre). While the Maoist Centre lawmakers on the hearing committee did not object to any of the nominations, they did raise a few questions during the discussions. \nParwati, a bright and social 15-year-old from Lalitpur, enjoyed connecting with friends and meeting new people through social media. But from last year, Parwati, who the Post is identifying with a pseudonym, hasn’t been the same as a result of online grooming and sexual abuse.“Our bubbly girl is no longer so,” said Parwati’s mother. “Although she is taking counselling, she is still soulless.”When she was 14, Parwati got a message from someone posing as a popular teen influencer. He complimented her on her photos and suggested she join an exclusive online group for aspiring models. Flattered by the attention, Parwati began talking to him daily.He gradually coaxed her into sharing private photos, promising that they would stay between them and assuring her that she was special.Slowly, Parwati became withdrawn, spending long hours on her phone and becoming unusually secretive. Her parents dismissed it as typical mood swings that teenagers go through.“If only we hadn’t noticed sooner, things wouldn’t have turned out this way,” says Parwati’s mother.Parwati, too scared to tell them, kept everything to herself, believing she could manage it on her own.It wasn’t until an explicit image of Parwati was leaked online in her school group that her parents finally understood the gravity of the situation. By then, the damage had been done—Parwati had been a victim of grooming and blackmail for nearly a year.Parwati’s experience shows how vulnerable online spaces are for children, who the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child defines as a person below the age of 18.Parwati’s case is not isolated.A research conducted by Voice of Children and KNH Germany in 2023 involving 514 children, families and child protection and juvenile justice stakeholders in Koshi and Bagmati provinces revealed concerning forms of OCSA (Online Child Sexual Abuse).Among the girls in the study, 38.6 percent reported receiving sexual calls and messages, 34.1 percent received inappropriate photos, 13.7 percent encountered indecent links, videos, or images, 6.8 percent were unaware of such occurrences, and 6.8 percent faced other forms of online harassment and exploitation.Among boys, 32.3 percent reported receiving sexual calls and messages, 29.2 percent were sent indecent photos, 15.4 percent received inappropriate links, 16.9 percent were unaware, and 6.2 percent experienced other forms of abuse and exploitation online.The growing incidents of various forms of online child sexual abuse and exploitation is further buttressed by data from the Cyber Bureau.In just under two months of the fiscal year 2024-25, the bureau has recorded 68 cases of cybercrimes involving children, including online sexual abuse.In fiscal year 2023-24, the bureau recorded 635 cases of cyber violence involving children, up from 176 cases in fiscal year 2022-23—for a 260.8 percent rise.Experts say while Nepal has made efforts to address online child sexual abuse, existing laws and frameworks are not being enforced due to limited resources, lack of awareness, and inadequate training.Moreover, parents, caregivers, and children are often unaware of the risks of online abuse, making the current legal framework insufficient to fully address the issue.The recent rise in cybercrime cases involving children can be traced back to the Covid lockdown, when digital platforms became essential for children’s daily education.However, according to Roshani Poudyal, an assistant professor of law at Tribhuvan University and researcher in digital safety, the real issue was lack of proper monitoring of children’s online activities, leaving them exposed to various dangers.“Parents and teachers haven’t done enough on addressing risks online,” Poudyal says.Cyber violence against children is not specific to Nepal—it’s a global problem.At the 28th session of the Human Rights Council in 2015, a report highlighted how new technologies, while offering opportunities, also increase children’s vulnerability to online sexual exploitation.Contrary to the general narrative, while it may seem that only girls are affected by OCSA, boys too are vulnerable, says Poudyal.A 2019 study conducted in the Philippines found that all children, regardless of gender, are at risk online; “boys seeking sexual identity support or accessing pornography are especially vulnerable,” the report said.The huge gap in reporting of online abuse is a problem, as per the research of Voice of Children. Parents hesitate to report such cases due to social stigma, and children often don’t realise they’re being abused. “For example, if someone comments on their picture saying, ‘You’re so beautiful’ or ‘You’re so sexy,’ children might take it as a compliment, unaware of its inappropriate nature, especially if a predator is involved,” Poudyal says.Even if they recognise the abuse, children hesitate to tell their parents. This fear of blame or dismissal usually keeps children silent.The cases of OCSA often being dismissed and unreported adds to the gravity of the issue as, in such cases, there is a higher chance of the impact of OCSA on children going unaddressed, as happened with Parwati who faced continuous abuse for a year.Parwati is still struggling from PTSD and depression, showing how the psychological toll of OCSA can be as severe as offline abuse. The victims often experience self-blame, depression, nightmares, suicidal thoughts and anxiety.Raju Ghimire, deputy director of Voice of the Children, points out that while Nepal has several relevant policies, they are fragmented and lack a dedicated focus on OCSA prevention.The Electronic Transaction Act, 2008 prohibits the dissemination of illicit content online but is insufficient to address online child sexual abuse. These include time limits for filing complaints (35 days), privacy concerns, fair trial issues, and inadequate child protection measures.Even the Act Relating to Children, 2018 fails to define key terms such as child pornography, grooming, sextortion, or cyberstalking, contributing to poor understanding among stakeholders.“The Act is also silent on how to handle cases where the abusers are parents or guardians, and it lacks provisions for alternative shelters for minor victims when family members are perpetrators,” Ghimire says.Not only is there a paucity of special protections for vulnerable groups like children with disabilities or those in the LGBTQIA+ community, the existing act related to children does not address cross-border online child sexual abuse which needs to be covered either by the Act Relating to Children or the Telecommunication Act, 1997.Ghimire says there should be a comprehensive umbrella act with specific provisions addressing OCSA. “This act should define and incorporate various issues related to OCSA,” he says. “There should be a consultative process to amend the Act Relating to Children, 2018 to better cover OCSA.”Ghimire also recommends including a child psychologist in the complaint registration and hearings process to ensure proper support.“The digital world is complex,” Poudyal says. “It is vital for parents, children, and everyone to be sensitised about online sexual abuse and cyberbullying.”She adds that prevention should be prioritised over legal protection after the abuse. She calls for a specific legal framework to improve reporting, response, and investigation mechanisms. “We need better monitoring and regulation of ISPs, clear definitions of various forms of online child abuse, and enhanced digital literacy for children, parents, teachers, and the general public,” she said.“Many people are unaware of what constitutes online sexual abuse or how to address it legally. Awareness programmes in schools and homes are a must. After all, these places are where children spend most of their time.” \nThe government on Thursday organised a concert on the occasion of the ninth Constitutional Day with the stated goal of connecting with the youth.The KP Sharma Oli-led coalition government of the CPN-UML and the Nepali Congress facilitated the National Day Concert for National Unity at Durbar Marg, in front of Narayanhiti Palace at the heart of Kathmandu.Government officials, however, claimed that the concert was mainly organised and run by the public.The government organised the main Constitution Day ceremony at the Army Ground at Khulamanch earlier in the morning.Though the Tundikhel function was the day’s main event, the concert was organised to connect the public, especially youth, with the constitution, according to an official at the prime minister’s secretariat.The official at the prime minister’s secretariat said that coordination with artists was done at the citizen’s level while the government also facilitated the event.At a press conference on September 16, Krishna Hari Pushkar, a secretary at the Prime Minister’s Office, speaking about the function, said, “This time, we are organising a public concert to mark the Constitution Day from the people’s level.”Pushkar added that the concert would make Nepal’s historic journey towards democracy and constitution-making memorable. While officials portrayed the concern as an event organised by the citizens, people looked annoyed by the presence of thousands of security personnel at and around the venue.Officials defended the deployment as a security measure. Thousands of youths participated in the concert carrying the national flag.Prime Minister Oli, in blue jeans and a shiny jacket, attended the event along with his wife, Radhika Shakya, and some ministers including Finance Minister Bishnu Paudel, Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak and Minister for Industry, Commerce and Supply Damodar Bhandari. The concert featured popular artists including Ananda Karki, Kunti Moktan, Devika Bandana, Sugam Pokharel, Deepak Limbu, Pramod Kharel, Subani Moktan, Swapna Suman and renowned bands Kutumba and Elements.In preparation for the concert, vehicles were restricted from Wednesday, causing traffic disruptions at and around Durbar Marg, Putalisadak, Lazimpat, Naxal and other thoroughfares at the city centre. \nThe livestock sector was hit hard by rising feed prices and the contraction of meat consumption last Dashain.This year too, an economic depression and growing joblessness have resulted in a fall in urban household incomes, subduing meat demand. This has affected rural farmers. Lately, however, traders are optimistic about Dashain as they see signs of an economic revival. The 10-day festival begins on October 3.The Kathmandu valley is estimated to have consumed 50,000 to 55,000 goats last Dashain. They estimate the demand in the Valley to surpass 70,000 heads this year, equal to the pre-Covid period.“Nearly 45,000 live goats will be brought by traders at the Kalanki goat market this year,” said Janak Kumar Khadka, president of the Kalanki Khasi Bazaar, one of the oldest livestock markets in Kathmandu.Farmers from different districts also supply goats to Kathmandu, which are estimated to be around 25,000 heads.“We will put extra stalls for farmers who come to sell goats on their own in the market,” said Khadka.The financial situation of farmers has worsened because of an increase in expenditure resulting from a rise in operating costs. Another factor is the slump in the consumption of meat and dairy products. Dairy farmers have not been paid by private and state-owned dairies for months.Economists say consumption has slowed down because people's real incomes have dwindled while urban households' finances are tightened due to growing unemployment, a decrease in real estate and stock prices, and rising cases of fraud in the cooperatives sector.The economic slowdown dampened the festival spirit last year, but traders are quite optimistic this year.While there is no official data on festival spending, economic activity in Nepal peaks during September-November.Some economists estimate that 40 to 70 percent of market activities occur around the three key festivals of Dashain, Tihar and Chhath.It is estimated that many people save throughout the year to spend during these festivals.Business house, bank, and government workers receive bonuses for festivals, and suppliers are keen to capitalise on the increased demand.Last Dashain, the cash crunch forced consumers to cut back on purchases. But this year, banks have sufficient liquidity, and traders are optimistic about sales growth.Traders say that the price of goats, which has already shot up due to the cost of production, will remain stable this Dashain.Animal sacrifices and feast mark the festival, with tens of thousands of animals and birds slaughtered during the country’s biggest festival.Khadka said that as domestic production would be sufficient to meet the Valley's requirements, there would be no imports. “Due to the normal supply trend, prices may remain unchanged at the current market rate.”Live goat prices range from Rs660 to Rs670 per kg in the market.Last Dashain, the price of live goats weighing 20-25 kg was Rs560 per kg, while goats weighing above 25 kg sold for Rs570 a kg. Every Dashain, the Food Management and Trading Company sells goats and mountain goats to check prices that tend to go up on the pretext of festivals.This year, it plans to bring in 1,800 goats and mountain goats.“We have allocated around Rs40 million to buy goats,” said Sharmila Neupane Subedi, information officer at the Food Management and Trading Company. “The budget has been managed from internal sources.”According to the company, goats and mountain goats will arrive at the company’s office on October 3, the day of Ghatasthapana. Goats are mainly supplied from Hetauda and Dang, and mountain goats from Mustang. The animals will be sold from four company outlets in the Valley. The state-run company will also fix the price of goats on Ghatasthapana.“Even though market prices fluctuate, we will set it based on the buying rate,” Subedi said. “But observing the market, I do not think the price will increase.”The company plans to reduce the number of animals, as some died last year for the lack of proper management.Last year, the company supplied 1,659 goats and 542 mountain goats for Dashain. Subedi said around 42 goats died as the livestock was kept in unfavourable weather conditions for long.Most of the goat and mountain goat sales happen on the seventh, eighth and ninth days of Dashain.This year, as the ninth day of Dashain overlaps the eighth, traders said sales will pick up from the seventh day. \nThe Ruby Khan-led Mahila Adhikar Manch—literally, women’s rights forum—has filed a complaint against Banke police and the district attorney at the National Human Rights Commission for their reluctance to lodge cases against Nepali Congress leader Badshah Kurmi.Forteeen protesters have been staging a sit-in at Maitighar in Kathmandu since August 9, demanding Badshah be sacked as a minister from the Lumbini provincial government and lodging a case against him in Banke district court. Though he stepped down as a minister last week following the protest, no cases have been filed against him.Badshah, a Nepali Congress leader and Lumbini provincial assembly member, is the prime accused in Nirmala Kurmi’s disappearance and capture of her property. Nirmala, a resident of Banke district, disappeared mysteriously in 2010 and remains missing.“The chief of Banke police and the district attorney have been creating obstacles for justice by not filing a court case in Nirmala Kurmi's case,” reads the complaint filed by the Manch, urging the commission to take action against them.Banke-based human rights activists have been staging protests regularly for 42 days, demanding to proceed to legal action against the Congress leader. “Badshah had to resign following our protest,” Khan said. “We will not give up unless the case against him reaches the court.”The protesters walk barefoot every day from Kalanki to Maitighar before commencing their indefinite sit-in at Maitighar and walking back. The government has made no overtures for dialogue yet.This is the fourth time they have been in the federal capital demanding justice for Nirmala.The protesters have been claiming that by refusing to implement past deals, successive governments have proved that they are not accountable to the people and not bothered about upholding the rule of law.They first started their protests in October 2021 as a group of 14 people, including 11 women, who arrived in Kathmandu from Nepalgunj, covering over 500 kilometres on foot in the quest for justice for two women victims of murder and disappearances. They had to march to Kathmandu after the local administration paid no attention to their protest.After 12 days of sit-ins and a hunger strike in 2021, the government had agreed to investigate the case of Nirmala, who disappeared mysteriously in 2010. Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba was the prime minister at the time.Badshah is the prime accused in Nirmala’s disappearance and capture of her property. Ignoring the agreement it had signed with Ruby Khan, the Congress fielded Badshah in the provincial assembly elections in November 2023. He won.One and a half years later, on July 23, the country’s biggest party made him a minister in the province. But he had to resign in less than two months.After around three weeks of protest, the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government had reached a five-point deal with Khan in the last week of June. This included completing the investigation of Nirmala’s disappearance without delay.Based on the agreement in October 2021, the government had formed a committee led by Hira Lal Regmi, then a joint-secretary at the home ministry.The committee, in its report submitted to erstwhile minister for home affairs Bal Krishna Khand, had recommended the arrest of, and investigation into, eight people for their alleged involvement in Nirmala’s disappearance.The police arrested seven, who were later released, but they never arrested the Congress leader. Badshah was also a Constituent Assembly member and an influential Congress leader in Banke.With the government’s reluctance to implement the Regmi panel’s recommendations, Khan, accompanied by 15 others, walked to Kathmandu on foot from Banke and started the sit-in in the Capital on November 25, 2021. They withdrew their protest on the 42nd day, after the government agreed to get the Central Investigation Bureau of Nepal Police to investigate Nirmala’s disappearance, implement the home ministry’s probe report and provide security to the protesters.Nirmala, 52, had gone missing in January 2010 from Janaki Rural Municipality in Banke. Her disappearance came to light two years after her two teenage sons were murdered in the span of a week.The constitutional human rights watchdog had in June directed the government to present a progress report on the agreements. The government has ignored the directive by refusing to report to the commission. \nDefending champions and leaders Armed Police Force Club demolished Koshi Province 8-0 to maintain their unbeaten record in the ANFA Women’s League on a crazy high-scoring day that also saw second-placed Tribhuvan Army Club crush Chandrapur 10-0 at the ANFA Complex in Lalitpur on Friday.Rashmi Ghishing was the star of the show for APF with five goals, while Anita KC and Anita Basnet were also on target. The victory also helped the reigning champions preserve their three-point lead at the summit. APF have 19 points from seven games with six victories and a draw. Later in the afternoon, Army pulled off the second biggest victory of the season so far after Chandra Bhandari and Amisha Karki netted hat-tricks against Chandrapur. Dipa Shahi scored a double, while their goalkeeper Anjana Rana Magar also got to the scoresheet scoring a penalty kick. Army also boast the record for the biggest victory of the season so far. They had beaten Sudurpaschim 14-1.At Satdobato, a rampant APF opened the scoring in the 5th minute through KC who tapped in a cross from Ghising.Basnet doubled APF’s lead in the 19th minute scoring a freekick.APF stayed quiet throughout the first half but Ghising had something else in mind and furthered the lead in the 56th minute heading in a cross from Basnet.Basnet added the team’s fourth in the 81st scoring another freekick.Ghising then found the net three times in the space of four minutes late in the game to pull off a huge victory for APF.Ghising now leads the goal scoring chart with nine goals. Waling Municipality’s Jackline Nassali is second in the race with seven goals.Army are bidding to win their first trophy of the women’s league and showed APF they are the true contenders by mauling sixth-placed Chandrapur.Army showed no mercy and took the lead early in the 2nd minute after Hima Chaudhary pounced on a defensive mistake from Sarita Kumari Nath and set up Bhandari to tap into an empty net.It opened the floodgates as Karki added Army’s second in the 28th clinically finishing a pass from Bimala Chaudhary.Dipa Shahi added more salt to Chandarapur wounds in the 32nd minute after goalkeeper Usha Thapa failed to get her hands on a cross from Bimala.Bhandari extended Army’s lead in the 40th taking advantage of a mistake from goalkeeper Thapa. Thapa needlessly deserted her post to unsuccessfully clear a through pass from Karki allowing a confident Bhandari to dribble past her, another chasing defender and slam into the back of the net.Karki then put Army 5-0 in front before the break, beautifully chipping over Chandrapur goalie Thapa.Chandrapur replaced goalkeeper Thapa with Sujata Jhari Magar after the break but it could not stop Army from scoring more.Shahi added Army’s sixth from the penalty seven minutes after the restart after Jhari Magar brought down Bhandari inside the box.Chandrapur conceded another penalty midway into the second half after their captain Saloni Rana Magar handled the ball inside the area. Army goalkeeper Rana Magar took the opportunity to refresh herself after sitting unemployed most of the time at the other end.Karki completed her hat-trick a minute later with a mesmerising finish after good work from Bhandari.Bhandari then added her third and team’s ninth in the 84th minute with a solo effort before Sharmila Thapa completed the statement win two minutes later.The victory gives Army 16 points from seven games.The top five teams at the end of the single-round robin league will progress to the Super League, which will be played in a double round robin format. The top four teams from the Super League will then proceed to the Qualifiers, Eliminator, and Final.Nepal Police Club and Waling Municipality—both on 12 points—will battle for the third spot when they lock horns against each other on Saturday.  \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli left for New York leading Nepal’s delegation to the 79th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) on Friday.The prime minister is accompanied by his spouse Radhika Shakya; Minister for Foreign Affairs Arzu Rana Deuba; Chief Adviser to the prime minister Bishnu Prasad Rimal; Foreign Secretary Sewa Lamsal; and other senior government officials.According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Prime Minister Oli is scheduled to address the General Assembly on September 26. This year’s general debate theme is “Leaving no one behind: Acting together for the advancement of peace, sustainable development, and human dignity for present and future generations.”Oli will also attend the opening session of the general debate on September 24 and a reception hosted by US President Joe Biden on September 25.During his visit, the prime minister will address the Summit of the Future as chair of the Global Coordination Bureau of Least Developed Countries (LDCs). Oli will also participate in the high-level plenary meeting on addressing the existential threats posed by sea-level rise and the high-level meeting on Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR), among other events. In addition to attending the UNGA activities, he is scheduled to deliver a keynote address on “Nepal’s journey to democracy and economic prosperity” at Columbia University on September 23 and speak at the John F Kennedy Jr Forum at Harvard University on “Nepal’s perspective: From transitional justice to climate justice” on September 27.He is scheduled to meet United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres and hold various bilateral meetings on the sidelines of the UNGA.Prime Minister Oli is scheduled to return home on September 30.Meanwhile, President Ramchanda Paudel has entrusted Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Urban Development Prakash Man Singh with the responsibility of overseeing the daily administrative works to be done by the prime minister in the latter’s absence.The President assigned Deputy prime Minister Singh the duty as per the prime minister’s recommendation, the Office of the President said in a statement issued by Shailaja Regmi Bhattarai, spokesperson of the office. \nAs the Nepali Congress chief whip in Parliament, Ramesh Lekhak was among the most vocal advocates for the formation of a parliamentary committee to look into the irregularities in the cooperatives sector, with a particular focus on Gorkha Media Network. This was less than three months ago when the Congress was the main opposition. There had at the time been widespread media reporting on how the network chairman, GB Rai, and Managing Director, Rabi Lamichhane, had been involved in embezzling money from cooperatives and pumping it into the network’s Galaxy 4K television. The matter was urgent as Lamichhane was the serving deputy prime minister and home minister. Credible evidence had surfaced of the home minister trying to suppress police investigation into his personal involvement in the scam. Partly as a result of the relentless pressure from the likes of Lekhak and his party, such a committee indeed came into being on May 28. The same committee has now presented reams of evidence showing how Lamichhane misused money illegally brought into the network from various cooperatives. Lekhak, who has replaced Lamichhane as home minister, now has the chance to walk the talk and implement the recommendations of the parliamentary probe committee he so earnestly championed. Lamichhane and his Rastriya Swatantra Party colleagues rather curiously claim that the party chair has been given a ‘clean cheat’ by the probe committee. Far from it. It has instead held him responsible for the gross misuse of his office of the Gorkha Media Network’s Managing Director. Additionally, the committee has presented clear evidence of how Lamichhane used forged documents to undertake various financial deals while serving as the network’s MD. This is also an untenable premise considering that people in similar positions have been prosecuted. For instance, Gita Basnet, a parliamentarian from the Rastriya Prajatantra Party, is on the run after the police filed a case against her. Basnet was held responsible for misusing the money of Nawalpur-based Chhipchhipe Cooperative, the money which had been invested in a resort she was operating. Interestingly, she was held responsible even though it was not her but her brother-in-law who had brought the money into the organisation. By comparison, the case against Lamichhane is more straightforward. Besides evidence of funds misuse, there is also paper evidence of millions of rupees being deposited into his personal bank account from the account of a cooperative. Legal experts say there is enough evidence to book Lamichhane for cooperative fraud under Cooperative Act, fraud and duping under the National Penal Code, organised crime under the Organised Crime Prevention Act and money laundering under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.This is not a question of exacting revenge against a political opponent, as some RSP leaders have tried to paint the case against Lamichhane. For Home Minister Lekhak and the administration, it is rather a matter of applying the law fairly. The government is already pursuing action against the other individuals who had been accused alongside Lamichhane in the same case. While a diffusion notice has been issued against GB Rai, others are in judicial custody. Lamichhane has thus far been let off the hook because of his political manoeuvrings. Now that the Cabinet has given Lekhakh the green signal to press ahead, he should diligently pursue the case to its end. How he pursues the culprits flagged by the parliamentary committee in the cooperatives scam, including Lamichhane, will define his success or failure as home minister.  \nAristotle emphasized democracy while Socrates criticized sophistry, highlighting the dangers of deceptive rhetoric in democratic systems; modern-day sophistry, known as \"post-truth\" politics, manipulates and controls the political landscape, enabling established parties to maintain power despite corruption and moral transgressions.\nE-commerce giant Amazon has built a reputation as a global company that “delivers at the fastest speeds”. In 2023, it claimed to deliver 7 billion items the same or next day. This record was possible because of thousands of men like Momtaj Mansur from Nepal. In 2021, Mansur was recruited by a labour supply firm to work for Amazon in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. He thought this would be his dream job.What he encountered over the next two years not only shattered that dream but made his life miserable, suffering “harsh (working) conditions at Amazon’s warehouses”. Mansur’s story, which was part of a media investigation, revealed how “major American corporations profit, directly or indirectly, from employment practices that may amount to labour trafficking, which is defined as using force, coercion or fraud to induce someone to work or provide service”.People from Nepal, Bangladesh, India and Myanmar continue to be trafficked to Middle Eastern countries as cheap labour, revealing in many cases that trafficking is marked by either abduction or recruitment from the source countries from where they are transferred through transit regions and end up as victims of exploitation in destination countries.This scenario is one aspect Popular understandings of slavery might recall images of the trans-Atlantic slave trade, which was abolished in the 19th century. However, slavery continues today in new forms that include debt bondage, domestic servitude, forced prostitution, forced labour, forced marriage and human trafficking.In 1999, there were an estimated 27 million people living in modern slavery globally. According to the International Labor Organisation and the Walk Free Foundation, that number rose to 40 million in 2018, and the latest estimate under the Global Slavery Index puts it at 50 million. The people who comprise these figures are hiding in plain sight, often as workers in the informal economy across a wide range of economic sectors.The UN Special Rapporteur on Contemporary Forms of Slavery has listed domestic servitude as one form of modern-day slavery. Domestic or home care work is reported to be the least regulated sector in all regions of the world. Non- or underpayment of wages, long working hours, exploitative working conditions, lack of or limited access to social protection, inability to change employers and tied sponsorship system such as the Kafala system make women, children and migrant workers particularly at risk of domestic servitude.Kafala systemIntroduced in the 1950s, the Kafala system regulates incoming migrant workers in most of the Arab Gulf states. It allows citizens or companies to sponsor a migrant to come and work for them. It ties the migrant workers’ immigration status to their sponsor. They are not allowed to change employers, leave the country or even travel locally without the permission of the sponsor.A sponsor can transfer his sponsorship to another national who is willing to purchase it. This purposeful disenfranchisement of the migrant worker has given rise to modern-day slavery. Workers are denied the right to freedom of association and banned from union membership. Women who leave their employers without “permission” are deemed illegal and face detention or deportation. Such policies dehumanise labour and undermine human rights and fundamental freedoms of migrants.Take the case of Indian national Mythili Ezhumalai, who was found unconscious in her Kuwaiti employer’s house in December 2023. She was allegedly forced to work more than 18 hours a day, which caused immobility to her left arm. Later, she suffered a heart attack.While trafficking continues to negatively impact millions of South Asians, especially those from India, Nepal and Bangladesh, there have been reports of egregious forms of human rights violations in the Gulf countries as thousands of women from these countries are allegedly sold every year in slave markets in the Middle East.In 2015, media reports revealed that New Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata were “transit points for these sex traffickers” and that the perpetrators included airlines and immigration officials. Two years later, the Uttarakhand police exposed a trafficking case involving six Nepalese women who were to be taken to the Gulf to work as domestic helpers. In June 2017, the police rescued rescued 16 Nepalese women at the India-Nepal border while they were being trafficked to India.The human rights violations that these women experience in destination countries remain invisible, as their servitude is confined within the private space of their employers’ homes. Domestic workers are not protected by labour laws in any of these countries. As a result, they can become trapped in modern-day slavery and face multiple barriers to accessing justice.Online slave marketsThere is a new dimension to this transnational problem.In 2019, a BBC undercover investigation revealed the prevalence of online markets where migrant domestic workers would be bought and sold on various social media apps. A huge number of photographs of such unfortunate women—along with their racial profiles—were displayed. Hashtagged posts would accompany sales settled through private messages.The sellers advised confiscating the women’s passports, confining them to the house, denying them any time off and giving them little or no access to a phone. This transaction was seen as a means to make profit by the employers. They could buy a maid for 600 Kuwaiti dirham (approx $US1,970) and sell her for 1,000 dirham ($US3,280). This online sale bypassed the recruitment agencies and created an unregulated black market, which made women more vulnerable to abuse and exploitation.Despite assurances from Facebook, Google and Apple that the offending hashtags would be removed and they would work with app developers to prevent illegal activity, the Centre for International Policy’s data on Global Social Media Harms published in 2023 again uncovered slave markets on social media.While UN Sustainable Development Goal 8.7 aims to do away with modern-day slavery, practical policy and practice measures, rather than ideological confrontation, will ensure better outcomes. Most Gulf countries have not taken easily to demands for abolishing the Kafala system, while some have signed bilateral agreements with provider countries.Saudi Arabia and the Philippines signed a bilateral agreement in 2013 that contained specific joint regulation of private employment agencies. India signed a mobility agreement with Saudi Arabia in 2014, and Kuwait in 2018 started recruitment of Indian domestic workers through government agencies. Such agreements could give some degree of protection to migrant domestic workers if they lay down provisions pertaining to minimum working age, working hours, transfer of salaries through designated bank accounts, holidays, right to association and bringing domestic work under labour laws.Eliminating online slave markets should be top priority for not only Gulf countries but also provider states. The app companies should be held liable if national regulation was to hold them accountable. Legislation ought to be designed to regulate social media companies. Banning migration of unskilled women under the age of 30 to 18 countries identified with history of labour exploitation and abuses merely pushes them to grey channels, depriving them of protective measures.The main way for provider countries to protect female domestic workers is simply to ban their mobility. However, a 2023 report shows that international migration leads to an enormous jump in income. So, instead of depriving South Asian women of this opportunity, states could draft policies of protection and empowerment.—360info \nNepal's ninth Constitution Day is marked with celebrations and protests, as Madhesh-based parties express grievances and demand amendments.\nNepal Army team participated in Sagarmatha Friendship exercise with China, while Pacific Angel exercise with the United States concluded, enhancing disaster management capabilities.\nParliamentary Hearing Committee seeks public complaints against proposed Chief Justice and two ambassadorial nominees in line with constitutional requirement.\nIsraeli warplanes carried out late on Thursday their most intense strikes on southern Lebanon in nearly a year of war, heightening the conflict between Israel and Lebanese armed group Hezbollah amid calls for restraint.The White House said a diplomatic solution was achievable and urgent, and Britain called for an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. The US is “afraid and concerned about potential escalation,” White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre told a briefing. The intense barrage followed attacks earlier in the week attributed by Lebanon and Hezbollah to Israel that blew up Hezbollah radios and pagers, killing 37 people and wounding about 3,000 in Lebanon. In Thursday's late operation, Israel's military said its jets over two hours struck hundreds of multiple-rocket-launcher barrels in southern Lebanon that were set to be fired immediately toward Israel. The bombardment included more than 52 strikes across southern Lebanon after 9 p.m. (1800 GMT), Lebanon's state news agency NNA said. Three Lebanese security sources said these were the heaviest aerial strikes since the conflict began in October. There were no immediate reports of casualties. Israel's military vowed to continue to attack Hezbollah and said its strikes throughout Thursday hit about 100 rocket launchers plus other targets in southern Lebanon. In a TV address on Thursday, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said the device explosions on Tuesday and Wednesday “crossed all red lines.” “The enemy went beyond all controls, laws and morals,” he said, adding the attacks “could be considered war crimes or a declaration of war.” Israel has not directly commented on the pager and radio detonations, which security sources say were probably carried out by its Mossad spy agency, which has a long history of carrying out sophisticated attacks on foreign soil. The Lebanese mission to the U.N. said in a letter to the Security Council on Thursday that Israel was responsible for detonating the devices via electronic messages and explosives implanted in them before they arrived in Lebanon, in line with theories that have circulated since the explosions. The 15-member Security Council is due to meet on Friday over the blasts. Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati called on the Security Council to take a firm stand to stop Israel's “aggression” and “technological war.” ISRAEL VOWS HEZBOLLAH TO PAY ‘INCREASING PRICE’ As Nasrallah's broadcast aired, deafening sonic booms from Israeli warplanes shook Beirut, a sound that has become common in recent months but has taken on greater significance as the threat of all-out war has ramped up. Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said late on Thursday that Israel will keep up military action against Hezbollah. “In the new phase of the war there are significant opportunities but also significant risks. Hezbollah feels that it is being persecuted and the sequence of military actions will continue,” Gallant said in a statement. “Our goal is to ensure the safe return of Israel's northern communities to their homes. As time goes by, Hezbollah will pay an increasing price,” Gallant said. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened his close circle of ministers for consultations, Israel's Channel 13 News reported. Two Israeli soldiers were killed in combat on Thursday in Israel's north, the Israeli military said. ‘BIG HARSH BLOW’ Hezbollah fired missiles at Israel the day after the Oct. 7 cross-border attack by the Palestinian militant group Hamas which triggered the Gaza war. Since then, constant exchanges of fire have occurred. Although neither side has allowed this to escalate into full-scale war, it has led to the evacuation of tens of thousands of people from the border area on both sides. Nasrallah said Hezbollah hoped Israeli troops would enter southern Lebanon because that would create a “historic opportunity” for the Iran-backed group. No military escalation, killing, assassinations or all-out war would return Israeli residents to the border area, he added. Israel will face “a crushing response from the axis of resistance,” Iran's Revolutionary Guards Commander Hossein Salami told Nasrallah on Thursday, according to state media, referring to a coalition of Iran-aligned militant groups including Hezbollah, Yemen's Houthis, Hamas and armed groups in Iraq and Syria. Speaking in Paris, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged restraint, adding he did not want to see escalatory actions by any party that make a Gaza ceasefire deal more difficult. The attacks on Hezbollah communications equipment sowed fear across Lebanon, with people abandoning electronic devices for fear of carrying bombs in their pockets. Nasrallah said thousands of pagers had been targeted simultaneously, with some of the explosions happening in hospitals, pharmacies, markets, shops, and streets busy with civilians, women, and children. Israel says its conflict with Hezbollah, like its war in Gaza against Hamas, is part of a wider regional confrontation with Iran, which sponsors both groups as well as armed movements in Syria, Yemen, and Iraq. Israel has been accused of assassinations including a blast in Tehran that killed the leader of Hamas and another in a Beirut suburb that killed a senior Hezbollah commander within hours of each other in July.   \nScarred by a decades-long civil war and struggling to survive in Sri Lanka’s crippled economy, ethnic minority Tamils in the island nation say they have little hope that Saturday's presidential election will improve their lot by much.Tamils form 12% of the country’s 22 million population but have long been electorally sidelined, as most candidates belong to the majority Sinhala population and many Tamils say they have no hope of a better future from those candidates.A 26-year civil war between Tamil insurgents, who wanted a separate Tamil nation in the north and east of the country, and government forces ended in 2009. Rights groups accuse both sides of abuses during the conflict in which 40,000 people died, according to UN estimates.“After we recovered from the losses that we faced during the war, we faced the Coronavirus pandemic and the economic crisis ... I don’t have any hope,” Paramasamy Thanabalasingam, a 62-year-old fisherman in Jaffna, capital of the Northern Province, told Reuters.Sri Lanka voted on Saturday to elect a new president for a five-year term, the first election since a severe shortfall of dollar reserves pushed the South Asian island into its worst financial freefall in decades.Traditionally, Tamils have voted for Tamil parties which are active in northern Sri Lanka, but Thanabalasingam says their vote is now split among many factions which claim to represent the minority’s concerns.“As of now, only a Sinhala candidate can be a president, there is a Tamil candidate as well but our Tamil politicians are split in several ways,” he said.“The decision (of who will be president) will be made by the majority Sinhala people, that is why I feel there won’t be any change,” he said.President Ranil Wickremesinghe, a Sinhalese standing for the first time as an independent candidate, is among the 38 candidates contesting Sri Lanka’s presidential election on Saturday. The election is shaping to be a close race between Wickremesinghe, opposition leader Sajith Premadasa, and Marxist-leaning politician Anura Kumara Dissanayake.Thanabalasingam says he and his family were displaced during the civil war, and the COVID-19 pandemic coupled with Sri Lanka's economic crisis has worsened their condition.Muththu Sivamohan, 66, secretary of a farmers’ union in Iranaimadhu, also in the Northern Province, said most Tamil farmers are slowly recovering from the 2022 economic collapse but are deep in debt due to expenses incurred during the crisis.“There has been no economic development in recent years,” he said. “We are of the view that there has to be a change in the government to put an end to the corruption culture.”“At the same time, we cannot compromise on our rights for the sake of development. That’s why we decided to support the Tamil candidate as our first choice,” he said. \nStriking junior doctors in India’s West Bengal state agreed to resume essential services, in a partial resumption of medical facilities, but they will continue their strike over the rape and murder of a colleague over a month ago.The rape and murder of the 31-year-old female doctor in West Bengal in August set off a wave of protests by doctors demanding greater workplace safety for women and justice for their slain colleague, prompting India’s Supreme Court to create a hospital safety task force.The junior doctors will resume essential duties from Saturday, the West Bengal Junior Doctors’ Front, which represents about 7,000 physicians in the state, said in a statement on Thursday.“The movement for “justice” will continue in each state-run hospital but we have decided to resume essential services in hospitals due to the flood situation in parts of the state,” Aniket Mahato of the West Bengal Junior Doctors’ Front said.Doctors are demanding better security, included additional CCTV coverage, deployment of female security personnel, adequate lighting, toilets, and resting spaces.A police volunteer has been arrested in connection the doctor”s rape and death in the R.G. Kar Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata city, the former principal of the college has been arrested over accusations of evidence tampering and graft, and the police chief of capital Kolkata has been replaced.Although tougher laws were introduced after the 2012 gruesome gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old student in national capital New Delhi, activists say the Kolkata case shows how women in the country continue to suffer from sexual violence. \nThe mpox outbreak in Africa is still not under control, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) warned on Thursday, adding that cases were still increasing in several countries.The World Health Organization declared the recent outbreak of the disease a public health emergency of international concern after the new variant was identified.Countries in the continent are struggling to respond to another major outbreak coming at the heels of the COVID-19 pandemic that exposed weak health systems that were unprepared to deal with a major public health crisis.The number of mpox cases in Africa has surged 177%, and deaths have increased 38.5% compared with the same period a year ago, data from the Africa CDC showed.“We can say today that mpox is not under control in Africa. We still have this increase of cases that is worrying for all of us,” Jean Kaseya, director general of Africa CDC, told a weekly briefing on the outbreak.In one week 2,912 new cases were reported compared with the previous week including a new country, Morocco, where a case was reported, confirming the spread of the disease in all four regions of the continent.So far, 15 of the 55 member states of the African Union have reported cases, Africa CDC said.“We still have people dying from mpox in Africa. In one week, we lost 14 people,” Kaseya added.He added in some countries, such as Cameroon and the Democratic Republic of Congo, two strains of the disease were in circulation, but because surveillance and testing systems were not robust enough, it was impossible to tell if that was the case in other countries.Kaseya said Rwanda had started its vaccination campaign, while the Democratic Republic of Congo, the epicentre of the outbreak, is set to start vaccinations in early October. \nToday the weather is forecast to be partly to generally cloudy throughout the country.Koshi, Bagmati and Karnali Province and a few places in Gandaki Province and one or two places of the rest of the country are likely to experience light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning.Tonight the weather will be partly to generally cloudy throughout the country. Light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is likely to occur at some places of the hilly region of Bagmati and Gandaki Province and at one or two parts of the hilly regions of the rest of the province.On Thursday Janakpur recorded the highest temperature at 38.8°C, and Jomsom recorded the lowest at 10.5°C.  \nJackline Nassali scored a hat-trick as Waling Municipality thumped Bagmati Youth Club 4-0 to climb to the fourth position in the ANFA Women’s League on Thursday.Cissy Nantongo also netted for Waling at the ANFA Complex as the victory moved them level with third-placed Nepal Police Club. Both Waling and Police have 12 points but Police sit third due to superior goal difference.For Bagmati, it has proved a false dawn after opening the women’s league with a 5-1 thrashing of Sudurpaschim Province. It remains Bagmati’s only victory of the season. They have lost four and drawn one since and sit miserably in the eighth position with four points.Waling lost their opening match against Koshi Province 4-0 but have remarkably revived their season with four victories, thanks to their Ugandan signings Nassali, Nantongo and Viola Namuddu.Their Ugandan players have now scored 12 of their 15 goals this season.It was Nassali’s second hat-trick for Waling after also finding the net three times against Karnali Province.To her name, Namaddu also has a hat-trick, which came against Sudurpaschim.Nantongo, who also scored a goal in Waling’s 2-1 loss against defending champions Armed Police Force Club, opened the scoring in the 22nd minute, beautifully placing a rebound after her freekick hit the bar first.It was all Nassali after that.Nassali doubled Waling’s lead in the 41st minute with a powerful shot. Sukriya Miya was the creator of the opportunity as her shot hit the upright and returned back. The lazy Bagmati defenders failed to clear the rebound, allowing Nassali to slam home a left-footed strike.Nassali furthered Waling’s lead in the 54th minute tapping in a rebound after Bagmati goalkeeper Sujata Tamang failed to grab her header.Nassali then completed a comfortable victory from close range in the 83rd minute converting a pass from Sushma Tamang. \nDrinking water used by Kathmandu and Lalitpur metropolitan city residents for drinking has been found contaminated with deadly microbes.According to officials at the Lalitpur Metropolitan City, 180 of 540 water samples collected from wards 7, 8, 9, 15, and 17 of the metropolis were found contaminated with faecal coliform.Similarly, of 506 samples of drinking water collected from wards 11, 12, and 13 of Kathmandu Metropolitan City, 98 were contaminated with faecal coliform.The presence of faecal coliform, a microscopic organism that thrives in the intestines of warm-blooded animals or their faeces, indicates sewage contamination in the drinking water, according to doctors.Officials at the Health Office Lalitpur have reported the presence of deadly microbes in all water samples, including those from the water utility and well water of the areas that saw cholera outbreaks this year.“Faecal coliform has been detected in all water samples from the cholera-hit areas,” said Shree Bhadra Sharma, a lab technician at the Health Office Lalitpur. In July, officials had confirmed a cholera outbreak in Thaiba area in Godawari Municipality of Lalitpur.“Water samples collected from other areas too have been found problematic,” Sharma said.Of 81 people who tested positive for cholera in various districts nationwide in the ongoing monsoon season, 53 were from Lalitpur districts. Health authorities say they had launched an awareness campaign and chlorinated the drinking water to tackle the contamination.Kathmandu reported 12 cases of cholera infection during the period.Cholera is a highly infectious disease that causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting, which in turn results in dehydration and can lead to death within a few hours if left untreated. The World Health Organisation says cholera is a global threat to public health and an indicator of inequality and a lack of social development.Health officials said that the Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool sample of an infected patient. They say even jar water, widely considered safer than water from other sources, has been contaminated with faecal coliform.Doctors say this is not the first time that the water used by people in the Valley was found contaminated with potentially deadly microbes. What concerns them more is that water quality has not improved significantly.“Consumption of water contaminated with human faeces causes diarrheal infections,” said Dr Arjun Sapkota, chief of the Health Office, Kathmandu. “We have launched an awareness drive in the areas where cholera cases were detected, and water samples were found to be contaminated with deadly microbes.”Doctors say consumption of contaminated water not only causes diarrheal infections and cholera but also increases the chances of contracting dysentery, typhoid, and hepatitis A and E.Initiating awareness drives and ensuring safe drinking water are the only ways to save people from water-borne diseases, according to them. A combination of careful surveys, provision of safe drinking water, good sanitation and hygiene standards, social mobilisation and treatment are required to contain the spread of infection, they say. \n\nOn September 1, on the final day of the Nepali Congress Central Working Committee meeting, General Secretary Bishwa Prakash Sharma explicitly urged Sher Bahadur Deuba, the party president, to give up his aspirations to be the prime minister yet again.As per the seven-point agreement between the Congress and the CPN-UML on July 1, UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli, the incumbent prime minister, will lead the government for the first two years. Then Congress chief Deuba will lead the government until the elections in November-December 2027. Sharma urged Deuba to leave the prime minister’s post for another senior Congress leader. Deuba reportedly rejected the proposal outright.“I will not give up the position just because someone so desires,” Deuba reportedly said in response.Sharma, one of the two general secretaries of the country’s oldest political party, had proposed an exit policy in his contemporary political proposal tabled at the Mahasamiti meeting in February for the leaders holding state positions such as president, prime minister, ministers.Besides Sharma's proposal, the Mahasamiti also endorsed the papers submitted by Vice-president Purna Bahadur Khadka and General Secretary Gagan Thapa. However, it also gave room for the central committee to modify the proposal. When the central committee approved Khadka’s policy proposal and Thapa’s organisational proposal with minor changes, Sharma’s paper was pushed back to be considered while amending the national constitution.Sharma proposed one term for the [country’s] President, two terms for the prime minister, three terms for ministers, and four terms for lawmakers. Sharma’s proposal on term limits on persons serving as the country’s president or the prime minister is a national rather than the party’s issue, so it has been deferred, according to party leaders. Most of the Congress central leaders who spoke at the meeting, which lasted almost a month with gaps in between, claimed that fixing a time limit for the leadership was contrary to the democratic principle that the party champions.UML chief whip Mahesh Bartaula also says that since politics is a voluntary job, the politicians should be able to contribute to the society for as long as they want. “Nonetheless, the exit policy proposal is thought-provoking,” Bartaula told the Post. As a new generation of leaders is yet to be fully developed, the public still trusts the older crop of leaders, he argues. “Those vying for top positions are yet to gain the public’s credibility.”For Krishna Pokharel, a professor of political science, it would be unnatural to amend the constitution to address Sharma’s demand. “In countries where people directly elect their prime minister, amending the constitution to limit the executive head’s term could be reasonable” Pokharel told the Post. “However, in a country like Nepal where the parties choose the prime minister, exit policy should rather be mentioned in the party’s statute.” Had Nepali leaders internalised the spirit of the parliamentary system, their entry and exit points need not have been discussed. “The parliamentary system in Nepal has been vulgarised,” Pokharel added. According to political experts, despite the Congress leaders criticising the exit policy at the central committee, the proposal’s public appeal is growing. They see no alternative to its implementation, sooner or later. One reason for growing public disenchantment with political parties is that the same old faces have continued in leadership positions for a long time. If there were a term limit for a leader in a governmental or party position, people’s dissatisfaction would somehow be addressed.Experts say the recent political upheaval in Bangladesh and the political crisis of Sri Lanka two years ago were due to the continuous rule by a single person or a single family.One reason some democracies struggle is their political leaders’ unlimited hunger for power, Uddab Pyakurel, a political analyst, told the Post. “In Nordic countries, there is no need to set term limits for leaders as there is already a strong democratic culture there.” Despite having leaders like Donald Trump, American democracy still works, partly because of the term limits, Pyakurel reasoned. “If Nepal is to strengthen its democratic system, it must implement the exit policy for political leaders,” he said. Some political experts see problems even after introducing a term limit.Arguing that limiting the tenure for top positions alone is not enough to put curbs on autocratic tendencies, Khagendra Prasai, another political analyst, said: “The major issue is developing political mannerism and culture.”Calls for the top party leadership making way for a new generation are growing not just in the Congress. Even during the CPN (Maoist Centre) standing committee meeting last month, Deputy General Secretary Janardan Sharma questioned Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s uninterrupted leadership for nearly 35 years. Sharma even urged Dahal to resign the position. Experts say leaders with limited terms realise they must get a lot done within the given time at the top. There is no slow cooldown period. The current set of top party leaders—Deuba, Oli and Dahal in particular—have been in power for two or three decades, repeatedly assuming the country’s top executive position. Article 216 (7) of the Constitution of Nepal says a person elected mayor for two terms will not be eligible to be a candidate in future municipal elections. Article 215 (7) has a similar provision for chairpersons of rural municipalities.The constitution also has a two-term limit for President.While all other top governing posts come with fixed terms, there are limits on how many times the prime minister, chief ministers, ministers, and lawmakers can serve. This allows politicians to occupy office for as long as they choose, preventing the leadership handover to the next generation. In the view of Mighendra Bahadur Karki, executive director of the Centre for Nepal and Asia Studies (CNAS) at Tribhuvan University: “Leaders who know that their peers, even junior colleagues, may someday be their supervisors may be more thoughtful of their behaviour. Poor behaviour and status anxiety might be reduced, increasing the room for collaboration.” If senior leaders know that they need to bow out of the government or the party after a particular time, they are more likely to train and promote junior leaders to take their place, Karki told the Post. “This in turn will cultivate a healthy political culture.”But he warned that the question of term limit is not straightforward. “The exit policy, if it is to be implemented, should be system-centric rather than targeting particular leaders.” \nEven in the era of the meteoric rise of ultra-right politics globally, Nepal is among a few countries whose politics is dominated by socialists of different shades. From democratic socialists to moderate Leftists to Marxists and Bolsheviks to Bolivarans, all dream of establishing a classless society under a single-party dictatorship. Not being a socialist in this country is a political sacrilege and, ostensibly, becoming anti-development, if not outrightly anti-national. Nevertheless, almost all of these pipe dreamers have accepted the “mainstream” adult franchise-based parliamentary democracy.Not being socialist also (perhaps) goes against the Constitution. This is because, in at least three instances, The Constitution of Nepal 2015 categorically mentions the term “socialism” while defining the nature of the Nepali state. The preamble states that the constitution was issued as its formulator, the Constituent Assembly, was “committed to socialism”. Article 4(1) defines the State of Nepal as “an independent, indivisible, sovereign, secular, inclusive, democratic, socialism-oriented, federal democratic republican state”. Under the Directive Principles (Article 50, Clause 3), the objective of the State is “to develop a socialism-oriented independent and prosperous economy.” Tragically, the constitution has skipped the definition of the term “socialism”, making it a paradise for the interpretation of convenience.Political stunts often resurface to save socialism from falling from grace. When Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the chairman of the CPN (Maoist Centre), was prime minister, he formed a socialist front last January, including three other left parties—Janata Samajbadi Party, CPN (Unified Socialist) and CPN (Biplov). Now out of power, Dahal is trying to bring other fringe parties into the fold for a more organised opposition to the current government. There have been several efforts in history to unite the so-called socialists. But in practice, opportunism has homogenised Nepal’s every political outfit into a power-hungry brute force without principle, let alone ideology. The travesty, however, is that the fundamental allegation to demean one party by the other, mainly among the communist parties, is “the blatant abandonment of the principles of socialism.”Outdated narrativesSocialism takes refuge in utterly outdated socioeconomics and ecopolitical narratives for its survival. The overarching prescription is that the state must not only provide free health and education but also reduce the private sector’s role in the economy. The constitution includes free education up to the secondary level, free basic health care and gainful employment as fundamental rights. The socialists see all economic and political ills as the outcome of engulfing trends of liberalisation and globalisation. They still advocate for land reform that ensures entitlement of the “land to the tiller”. However, in reality, the younger generation is unwilling to own farms as they are moving away from agriculture to modern sectors of employment and entrepreneurship. Huge amounts of fertile land are increasingly being left uncultivated for want of people opting for farming. Besides, the unplanned drive of land fragmentation has converted entire farmlands into unfeasible patches for commercial-scale production of agricultural products. Failed land use planning and haphazard urbanisation have further eroded the prospects of the land used for agriculture.The pro-socialist crusade may not have appeared vocal to stop the privatisation of highly loss-making state-owned enterprises, stall private sector economic reforms and discontinue the centralised planning process, but they have crept into every aspect of economic policy-making. As a result, the economy is persistently left without a development model, and growth has stagnated beyond endurance. Nepal’s market integration with even the regional market is very limited, and the economy, seemingly irreversibly, becomes import-dependent, draining out capital and young brains.RamificationsThe discourse itself is anachronistic. The political parties are not competing to be forward-looking and pro-reform but to prove themselves purer socialists than others. This is rapidly disconnecting the political parties from the political system the country has adopted at a great opportunity cost and from the economic system that must generate output to increase public well-being.Philosophically, socialism with intended control of the state is the opposite pole to federalism, which seeks to devolve political and economic power closer to the masses. But most of Nepal’s political parties are playing devout socialists and ardent federalists. So, it is no surprise that federalism has been able to produce only suboptimal results during the last seven years of its implementation. The subnational political and administrative units created akin to the federal setup for all practical purposes remain subservient to the power concentrated at the centre. The concept of the controlling “central” government is finding it hard to convert into a coordinating “federal” government.The socialist idea of every facility being financed by the state certainly looks benign on the surface. This simply means the state treasury has to be adequately filled and continuously replenished to fulfil all existing public demands for services and facilities and be enough to meet future aspirations for improved quality of life. Without a reliable revenue source, the state can neither finance better public delivery nor develop infrastructure for the future. Nepal is now exactly in this trap.The real paradox of the socialist model of state-managed economy lies exactly here. Revenue on a convincing scale can only be generated if private sector investment substantially increases productivity, profit, employment and personal income. The state financing everything, even if it becomes a basic right included in the constitution, is impossible without making the market economy sizable, vibrant and capable of paying taxes. Such a market is impossible to imagine without unhindered private sector investment. Foreign investment is the new paradigm in the economies with comparative advantage. However, the very idea of a state-controlled socialist economy is perhaps enough to turn the heads of foreign investors away from the economy in question.Even Karl Marx’s Das Kapital advocated for the highest level of capital growth for extreme exploitation to explode into revolution. However, Nepali socialists didn't even recognise the importance of the inevitable expansion of capital for a state. The state apparatus has evolved since Marx to prevent extreme exploitation. Also, capitalists need not be exterminated by violence but can be constructively made liable to duly paying tax to the state.   \nMaya, a 36-year-old single mother from Babarmahal, Kathmandu never imagined that a polite rejection on Facebook two months ago would spiral into a living nightmare.Maya (her real name has been changed to protect her identity) became the target of an online stalker after she rejected a man’s advances. What started as a few friendly messages on social media quickly took a dark turn when the man demanded nude photos of her, which she refused to send.Unfazed, he started sending her unsolicited explicit images of himself. He then began tracking her online activity, leaving threatening messages, and eventually, he found her home address. “I would receive messages saying he was watching me, that he knew where my son went to school,” Maya told the Post. Despite blocking him multiple times, the stalker always found a way to reappear, using different accounts to harass her. Fearing for her nine-year-old son’s safety, she finally mustered the courage to file a complaint with the Cyber Bureau of Nepal Police 15 days ago.Since informing the stalker that she had taken legal action, he has not contacted her again, but the experience has left her feeling paranoid and anxious. She now fears leaving her home and hesitates to go online. “I just want to feel safe again, but I’m not sure if that’s possible anymore,” Maya says.Maya’s ordeal speaks volumes about how violence against women is no longer confined to physical spaces but has increasingly infiltrated the digital world in the form of online abuse, from revenge porn and bullying to sexual harassment, trolling, fraud, and blackmail.The severity of this issue becomes even clearer with data from the Cyber Bureau. In just under two months of the fiscal year 2024-25, the bureau has already recorded 882 cases of cybercrimes involving women. Looking back at previous years, the figures paint a troubling picture. In the fiscal year 2022-23, there were 9,013 reported cybercrime cases, with 4,590 filed by women. The period also saw 130 cases involving minor girls. The following year, 2023-24, witnessed a dramatic rise in the number of cases involving women to 8,745 and those involving minors to 382. This represents an increase of approximately 90.52 percent in cyber violence cases reported by women from 2022-23 to 2023-24.As the country entered a new fiscal year, the trend of online violence continues, with the bureau already reporting 35 cases involving minor girls and 882 cases involving adult women. However, these numbers alone do not capture the full extent of women’s and girls’ vulnerability in the digital space. Traditional beliefs, discrimination, and the normalisation of such behaviour, along with the fear that exposing abuse will shame them and their families, often lead to many cases going unreported.Rita, a 27-year-old woman, from Sunsari whom the Post is identifying with a pseudonym, is one such victim. She never imagined that a relationship she once cherished would end up destroying her life. After a difficult breakup, her ex-partner with whom she had a live-in relationship, sought revenge by sharing intimate videos and photos of her online with her family, friends, and relatives in 2022.For the next six months, her ex continued to sexually harass her through social media. The abuse only ceased after she attempted suicide, which resulted in a three-week hospitalisation.“Even after all this happened, my family refused to help me file a complaint. My relatives even mocked me, saying that I had already done intimate things during the live-in relationship. They said he wasn’t physically hurting or abusing me, so I should just get over it”, says Rita.According to a UN report based on studies in 10 countries, an estimated 95 percent of aggressive behaviour, harassment, abusive language, and degrading images online are directed at women, and they often come from partners or ex-partners.A year has passed for Rita, but the emotional scars remain, and she continues to struggle with depression.Many in Nepal, like Rita’s relatives, downplay the impact of online harassment, dismissing it as “just virtual, not physical.” However, a UN report titled ‘Combating Online Violence Against Women & Girls: A Worldwide Wake-Up Call,’ published by the UN Broadband Commission in 2015, tells a different story. It argues that ‘cyber touch’ can be as damaging as physical touch, suggesting that online abuse can be as bad as domestic violence or sexual assault.Now, as women across Nepal are celebrating Teej, many find themselves facing online violence. They are subjected to a barrage of hate speech simply for enjoying themselves.In recent years, the sight of women dancing, singing, drinking, and celebrating during Teej has sparked outrage among certain segments of society, particularly men who see these activities as a challenge to traditional gender roles. Social media trolls have seized on the opportunity to attack and criticise what they consider ‘inappropriate behaviour, clothing, and dance.’“Every year, it’s the same story,” says Ankita Chapagain, a 40-year-old from Kathmandu. “As soon as videos of women enjoying Teej and dancing go online, the hate comments start pouring in. We’re called names, our morals are questioned, and we’re blamed for the supposed degradation of society.”This animosity extends beyond anonymous trolls; it mirrors a deeper social unease with women’s independence and the pervasive misogyny and patriarchy in our culture. “It’s as if they can’t stand to see women happy and celebrating on their own terms,” Chapagain adds.The problem intensifies during elections, with female politicians facing significant online abuse. An analysis conducted by Panos South Asia reveals that insults and hate speech are the most common attacks on female politicians.A joint statement by the United Nations Special Rapporteurs on Violence against Women and Freedom of Expression says online violence against women can “chill and disrupt the online participation of women journalists, activists, human rights defenders, artists, and other public figures and private individuals” —which underscores the severe impact of growing cyber violence.So, how well-prepared are the institutions responsible for addressing this issue, like the Cyber Bureau? The answer seems to be, not very well.Superintendent of Police Deepak Raj Awasthi, spokesperson, and information officer of the Cyber Bureau, told the Post last month that the bureau is struggling with both understaffing and underfunding.The gap between the rise in cybercrimes and the lack of resources leaves the virtual realm a dangerous space, especially for girls and women who are already vulnerable due to unsafe physical environments, pervasive misogyny, and systemic discrimination. \nRae was the envoy to Kathmandu during the promulgation of the 2015 constitution and the subsequent blockade. In this conversation, Rae talks about the evolution of Nepal-India ties since the blockade, regional geopolitics, what the two countries get wrong about each other, how New Delhi views Nepali communist parties and the governments they lead, and the change (if any) in India’s neighbourhood policy since the start of Narendra Modi’s third term in office. \nKunwar has been the MD for just under three years. Before coming back to her homeland to join Daraz Nepal, she worked at different American companies, including Amazon, the world’s biggest e-commerce platform. In this conversation, Kunwar talks about the opportunities and challenges of running an e-commerce enterprise in Nepal, as well as the country’s overall business environment.  \nWhen the Ranjitkar group was established, they discovered this forgotten dance and devoted two years to researching it.Now, they are reintroducing it during Indra Jatra by training the new generation in this traditional art form. \nHe is known for his nationalist legacy, marked by the amendment of Nepal's map to include territories like Kalapani, Lipulekh, and Limpiyadhura, and his strong stance against India, especially during and after the 2015 Nepal blockade.But how did he rise to become the country's powerful man? \nTanka Chaulagain is a theatre artist, writer, and director. He has directed various plays, such as ‘Romeo and Juliet’, ‘Charlie and the Chocolate Factory’, and ‘Matilda’. Chaulagain is also the founder of ‘Lalabala’, an acting platform for children. He has also authored several books, such as ‘Kathmandu Geet’, ‘Taalatuli’, and ‘Ubadkhaabad’.In this conversation with the Post’s Rishika Dhakal, Chaulagain discusses his newly published book ‘Rudane’. What is your recent book about?My latest book is based on the life of Rup Chandra Bista, a well-known political figure. It's a mix of biography and fiction. Since the book is autobiographical fiction, some readers have asked why I chose to fictionalise Bista’s life instead of writing a straightforward biography. As someone with a background in theatre and drama, I was drawn to the dramatic elements of his journey. While biography is bound by facts, which anyone can research and present, fiction allows me to explore, be creative, and let my imagination shape the narrative. This approach makes the story more engaging, so I opted for a fictionalised account of Rup Chandra Bista’s life.While writing fiction, there’s a concern that the emotional elements might overshadow the historical facts, potentially erasing them. So, how have you balanced these aspects to avoid distorting history?I was aware of the challenge this posed as a writer. I never met Rup Chandra Bista, so I can’t write about him from a personal perspective. Sometimes, it’s easy to exaggerate a person's character when trying to make the narrative more dramatic, making them seem different from who they truly were. To ensure I was fair in my portrayal, after finishing the draft, I gave it to Rup Chandra Bista’s nephew, Bhuwan Prakash Bista, for his review. He raised similar questions and suggested a few corrections.Taking his feedback seriously, I revised the manuscript several times, carefully considering what he was trying to convey. After four or five rounds of edits, I feel I was able to present a more accurate balance of Bista's personality.However, my portrayal is still based on my understanding of him as a charismatic leader. I gathered information by listening to people who knew him and reading articles about his life, but my depiction may not fully capture his philosophy. That’s why I called it fiction.Why did you write about Rup Chandra Bista?In 2020, I did a play about Yogmaya, which was well-received. Yogmaya advocated a ‘dharma rajya’—a just and righteous society. While searching for another figure with a similar revolutionary spirit, I came across Rup Chandra Bista, whose story captivated me. A film about Bista was planned then, but the project was halted for 3-4 years and eventually cancelled. One of my brothers suggested turning the story into a drama. However, I was more fascinated with the narrative itself, and instead of writing it for the stage, I chose to turn it into fiction. That’s how the idea for the book emerged.Another reason I decided to write about Bista is that, in today’s political landscape, I don't see any leader with a philosophy like his. Bista was a leader who connected with people from all social classes. He had a separate group for children, encouraging them to “Know”—his guiding motto. He believed that awareness was key to individual and societal change. He also formed a group for women and supported their causes.Although Bista came from a wealthy family, he chose to live among the poor. He worked alongside them, striving to enlighten and uplift the marginalised.Bista’s deep connection with people and unique vision drew me to his story, leading me to base my book on his life.How important is your new book in today’s political and social climate? Looking back at history, Rup Chandra Bista was a political figure who thrived within the system of his time, winning elections multiple times during the Panchayat era. Yet, he wasn't afraid to openly criticise the Panchayat governments for their wrongdoings. Despite his privileged background, Bista lived a simple life. He strongly believed in reusing things and always wore second-hand clothes. In today’s world, with issues like climate change and overuse of resources, Bista’s lifestyle should resonate with our society. Inspired by him, I’ve started sleeping on the floor to feel more connected to the Earth.Bista also spent two decades living with farmers in Sim Bhanjyang, where he grazed goats and cultivated potatoes and cauliflower to improve their livelihoods. His focus on uplifting the underprivileged reflected his belief that society can only progress when the most disadvantaged rise.Looking at Nepal’s current political situation—where there is no consensus among parties and governance feels disorganised—alongside society’s increasingly materialistic values, I believe this book is more relevant than ever.How has your background in drama influenced your approach to writing fiction?As a drama student, I naturally include a lot of dialogue in my fiction writing. Writers like Buddhisagar and Subin Bhattarai often focus on playing with words and descriptions, but in my process, I focus on creating scenes, establishing characters, and weaving in dialogues. For instance, my book ‘Rudane’ has plenty of dramatic dialogue. Without them, the book could have risked becoming a straightforward biography. However, the dialogue helped breathe life into the characters. Writing them and building scenes allowed me to bring the story to life.Writing drama in Nepal is particularly challenging. The play's audience is small, and there is no guarantee that it will reach its intended audience or be published and read. That's one of the reasons I shifted toward fiction writing. However, I still translate plays I enjoy, which helps me balance my love for both forms. Even in my fiction, especially in the dialogues, the influence of drama is quite evident.While fiction usually requires fewer dialogues than drama, writing both involves building vivid scenes. For example, when writing a scene with four characters in a café, I instinctively imagine the entire setting, down to the smallest details. My background in drama has been invaluable in this regard, as it has helped me visualise scenes more easily and bring them to life in my fiction.What message do you want to convey to readers through your book? Rup Chandra Bista's life offers many valuable lessons. He believed in living a minimalist lifestyle and prioritised using Nepali products. Bista often wore clothes, bags, and other items made from burlap sacks. Despite being offered prestigious jobs, including one by Juddha Shumsher, he always put the well-being of others before his own.In contrast, today's generation often focuses more on personal gains than thinking of others. Through my book, I hope readers will learn from Bista’s selfless lifestyle and reflect on how they can also think about the needs of others. Bista was a man of strong principles and died on his terms. His statement, “Those I tried to awaken never did. Those who were awakened only ended up supporting the opposition,” reflects his deep frustration with the political system of his time.Beyond the political and social lessons, Bista's life, as shared through various articles and stories, offers timeless insights into leadership, selflessness, and the pursuit of justice for all.Tanka Chaulagain’s book recommendationsSotalaAuthor: Dor Bahadur BistaPublisher: Sajha PrakashanYear: 1976Bista's work captures a bygone era when many Nepalis journeyed to Tibet for the salt trade, offering readers a glimpse into Nepali society at that time.Lamppost Bata Khaseko JoonAuthor: Manu ManjilPublisher: FinePrintYear: 2011This poetry collection features forty-six free verse poems and the book is known for its portrayal of contemporary Nepali culture.Mantha Darayeko JugAuthor: Mohan Mainali Publisher: Heritage Publishers and DistributorYear: 2015This book chronicles the lives of those who were killed during the war, highlighting their valiant efforts to protect themselves and their families.YashodharaAuthor: Haribol KaflePublisher: Lipi BooksYear: 2023Told from Yashodhara's perspective, this novel provides a fresh view of Siddhartha's journey to becoming the Buddha.UlarAuthor: Nayanraj PandeyPublisher: Tanneri PrakashanYear: 1998This book is a window into the harsh reality of politics and people who have suffered from political instability. \nRepresentatives at the first national conference of the Rastriya Swatantra Party saw factionalism within the party.Some of the representatives who arrived in Kathmandu three days ago for the two-day gathering starting on Tuesday said that growing factionalism is not healthy for the new political outfit promising to challenge traditional forces like the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML.“We were told that factionalism existed in our party in various forms, but we denied such claims. However, during our three days in Kathmandu, we witnessed it,” a group of party members told the Post. It seems that President Rabi Lamichhane and Vice-president Swarnim Wagle are not in the same boat on how the party should function, they added.RSP acting spokesperson Manish Jha explains that it is the lack of synchronisation—rather than differences—between the leaders. “People from various schools of thought came together to form the RSP. It is true that we lack synchronisation, but it would be wrong to portray it as differences.”Another leader of the party said on condition of anonymity that the party has two schools of thought—one based on democratic principles and the other opposed to it.RSP acting general secretary Kabindra Burlakoti claims that the party is united.In conversations with the Post, representatives from Kathmandu Valley, Pokhara and Chitwan sounded more optimistic with the central leadership while those from remote areas were confused over their take on the party’s central leadership.The representatives from Madhesh were mild in their opinion about the leadership.Moreover, representatives were also not very positive about the way the central leadership is investing their energy to claim that Lamichhane had got a clean chit from the parliamentary special committee formed to investigate crisis-ridden cooperatives.The probe panel, which submitted its report to the House of Representatives, has recommended the government prosecute Lamichhane, along with his former business partner GB (Gitendra Babu) Rai, board member of the media Kumar Ramtel and initial founder Chhabi Lal Joshi as per the prevailing laws. The inquiry committee, however, has said it couldn’t establish Lamichhane’s role in rerouting the cooperatives fund to Gorkha Media Network.“It would have been better had the central leadership waited to see how the government would take action,” the group of representatives from western Nepal told the Post. “In case Lamichhane is booked under the law, it could be counterproductive for the party in the long run.”The political campaign started by the RSP won’t get stalled even without Lamichhane, the representatives said, expressing their confidence in the party’s longevity.Lamichhane also presented a political report incorporating proposed statutory changes, the party’s commitments to voters, policy agenda presented by Swarnim Wagle at the Jaleshwar meeting and the conclusion drawn from the closed session of the national conference.Lamichhane’s report states that the policy paper presented in Jaleshwar defined ‘constitutional socialism’ as the party’s political ideology. Lamichhane also accuses the ruling Nepali Congress and CPN-UML of trying to lead the country to a two-party system by polarising smaller parties. “On the pretext of administrative reform, they are planning to wipe out the existence of small parties,” the report reads. “Potentially, this step can bring together new parties that want to be an alternative political force sooner or later.”Asked about RSP’s possible alliance with other parties, Burlakoti said though they are not in talks with the main opposition CPN (Maoist Centre), they are in regular contact with several independent candidates of last election.Asked if they are in discussion with Kathmandu Metropolitan City Mayor Balendra Shah, who won the 2022 local election independently, Burlakoti said: “Strategic moves are not to be disclosed.”However, when the national conference concluded after Lamichhane presented his report, representatives arriving from around the country were displeased.“This is not the way a party functions,” a representative told the Post, asking not to be named for fears of reprisal.When leaders put themselves at the centre and cadres in the periphery, the party’s downfall begins, another representative said. Acting General Secretary Burlakoti, however, defended the party leadership. “Our national conference was designed this way,” Burlakoti said. The report presented by the chair will be discussed in the party’s Mahakali-Mechi campaign that will start soon, he added.“At the national conference, we gave 5 percent of the total representatives (1500) time to speak, but those who spoke exceeded that number,” Burlakoti said.The conference, however, passed Lamichhane’s report. On Wednesday, Lamichhane announced the date of the party’s first general convention. It will be held on May 8-10 at a yet-undecided venue.“I would like to inform you that the Central Committee has become the general convention organising committee,” Burlakoti said. Lamichhane also announced the ‘Mahakali-Mechi Campaign’ to interact with the general public.In his report, Lamichhane has proposed a person not affiliated to any party to be elected the country’s president, directly elected executive head, or the prime minister. He also proposes giving the nation’s vice president the responsibility to chair the National Assembly.While the paper bats for a fully proportional electoral system, it says provincial assemblies cannot be accepted in the current shape.However, this does not mean the RSP is against the federal structure gained through the sacrifice of thousands of people, another representative said. “Our party has no strength to amend the constitution and scrap the federal structure. Therefore, for the time being, voices are growing among the party members about accepting the present political structure,” Khemraj Koirala, a conference representative from Kailali told the Post.Party members also suggested downsizing the number of ministers to make the provincial system functional, Koirala said.The report also stands for reducing the number of municipalities to less than 500, from the current 753. \nThe coalition government of the CPN-UML and the Nepali Congress has reiterated its commitment to review the achievements made and weaknesses observed in the course of implementing the constitution in the past nine years.The two ruling parties have pledged to amend the constitution based on a broader understanding made through discussions, dialogues and consultations with political parties, civil society, intelligentsia, constitutional experts and the public.The parties have said such amendments will be made mainly based on the findings of the review and experiences of implementing it. Moreover, the parties said that establishing political stability in the country would be the major objective of the amendment.The two ruling parties made the commitments in the common minimum programme of the government, which was submitted to Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli and Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba on Wednesday evening. The parties had earlier formed a four-member panel to draft the government’s programme based on a seven-point agreement reached between the Congress and the UML in the first week of July. Party general secretary Gagan Thapa and spokesperson Prakash Sharan Mahat from Congress, and party deputy general secretaries Pradeep Gyawali and Bishnu Rimal from the CPN-UML were tasked to prepare the document. They jointly submitted the document to the two party chiefs and made it public.“The achievements of the 2006 movement and the fundamental pillars of this constitution including federal, republic and inclusive governance system will be further institutionalised and strengthened,” the document says.The seven-page document is divided into eight subtitles—safeguarding national interest and independent foreign policy; protection, implementation and amendment of the constitution; good governance and quality service delivery; dynamic economy and development; ensuring social justice and fundamental rights; youth partnership; transitional justice, sustainable peace and social harmony; and miscellaneous.The coalition has pledged to set up a high-powered cooperative regulatory body as per the recommendation of the parliamentary inquiry committee to address the problems seen in the cooperative sector.“Taking action against those involved in misusing funds from cooperatives, the return of depositors’ money will be ensured,” the common minimum programme states.The ruling parties have pledged to punish corrupt people irrespective of the individuals’ power and positions. On the economic front, the coalition has vowed to expedite generation and transmission of hydroelectricity and further intensify the electrification process. \nThe erstwhile Pushpa Kamal Dahal government on April 12 constituted a committee led by Om Prakash Mishra, a former chief justice, to nominate candidates to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons. While the government picked four members for the committee, the fifth member is either the chairperson of the National Human Rights Commission or someone nominated by him. Initially, the commission had insisted that revision of the Enforced Disappearance Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act was a precondition for its participation in the committee, but following the Act’s amendment, it agreed to join the Mishra panel. However, three weeks after President Ramchandra Paudel authenticated the bill to amend the Act that the federal parliament endorsed, the constitutional human rights watchdog has yet to recommend its representative. Its officials said they are waiting for a formal request from the Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs, as they expect a new letter in the changed context.“We have been told the ministry would send a new request letter for our representative, given the new context following the amendment to the Act,” said a commission member. The revised Act states that the recommendation committee has two months to make nominations for the chairpersons and members of the two commissions. It has already been five months since the Mishra-led panel was formed. However, a senior official at the law ministry said he does not think a new process needs to start just because the Act has been amended. “The two month countdown began the day the revised Act was enacted,” said the official. “I also don’t think the ministry told the commission that it would send a new request letter. If such a message was conveyed, it may have come from the political level.” Those involved in forging all-party consensus on the amendment say tensions between the CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre) have stalled the transitional justice process. Relations between the two parties have not been cordial ever since the formation of the new ruling alliance. The UML has consistently referred to the Maoist insurgency as ‘violence’, while the Maoist Centre has warned that the present KP Sharma Oli government could meet the same fate as Sheikh Hasina Wazed, the immediate past prime minister of Bangladesh.“The tussle between the two parties has directly affected the ongoing process,” one leader involved in the negotiations told the Post. “Oli doesn't seem as interested as he was earlier.”The committee was formed in May amid reservations from conflict-era victims of human rights violations and human rights defenders, who demanded that the Act be amended before selecting office bearers. The government, however, argued that forming the committee was necessary as per the Supreme Court’s March 12 order to the government to select office bearers for the two commissions within a month.The court had asked the government to constitute task forces within the commissions to conduct preliminary investigations into the victims’ complaints until the office bearers were appointed.Following the court’s order, the victims and human rights defenders demanded the government and the parties endorse the legal amendments by the top court’s deadline before starting the selection process. However, the amendment bill couldn’t be endorsed within the deadline, prompting the government to form a committee based on existing law.Following the committee’s formation, the victims and human rights defenders requested the government to halt the selection process until the Act was amended. They also urged the national rights watchdog to hold off on sending its representative.The two commissions have been defunct since July 2022, when the government decided to extend their terms without retaining their chairmen and members. The government claimed the bill to amend the transitional justice law would be endorsed by October 2022, and the appointments made based on the revised Act.But it took over two years for the federal parliament to endorse the bill. The victims and human rights defenders are closely watching who will be appointed to the commissions.The Truth Commission has received 63,718 complaints, while the commission on disappearances is sitting on around 2,400 cases. The new teams will have four years to accomplish their tasks, though there are provisions for their extension. The commissions that were formed in 2015 have done nothing other than collect complaints and conduct preliminary investigations on some of them.  \nRastriya Swatantra Party chair Rabi Lamichhane, addressing a two-day national conference of the party's central council that started on Tuesday, said that the emergence of the RSP has been a headache for Nepal’s traditional political parties.“Until we win a majority in the next election, their headache will continue,” Lamichhane said. “Some people think that if Rabi Lamichhane is defeated, then the role of RSP in national politics will shrink. However, with or without Rabi, RSP now will move ahead as a campaign.”At the national conference of central council members, all seven provincial committees presented their reports. In the process, some committees briefed the RSP on the financial difficulties they are facing to run their day-to-day activities, whereas others hinted at the challenges they are facing building the party organisation.Party’s Koshi provincial president Rajesh Timilsina said there are 25,000 RSP cadres in the province. Due to irregular levy payments from cadres, it had been difficult to run the party.“We now face the challenge in expanding the party’s membership base,” a party leader quoted Timilsina as saying. There were more people frustrated with the party’s activities than those attracted to it.Timilsina also called for a regular financial source to carry out party activities, the leader said.RSP provincial president for Madhesh Tapeshwar Yadav presented a report depicting the party in good light in the province. “If general elections were to be held now, our party would either lead the province or take the main opposition position,” a party insider told the Post, quoting Yadav.Achyut Lamichhane, the provincial chief of Bagmati, claimed that the leadership had expanded the membership in Chitwan and Kathmandu by 7,000 and 5,000, respectively.Party’s Lumbini committee chief Devraj Pathak, presenting the provincial report, said that a funds crunch had hampered the committee’s activities. In Karnali, the RSP is tackling geographical difficulties in welcoming more members to the party. Sudurpaschim party chief also briefed the leadership on the difficulties the provincial committee is facing in expanding the membership, the party leaders said.The financial report presented by RSP treasurer Lima Adhikari suggests that the party’s income totalled Rs34 million in the fiscal year 2023-2024. The amount includes membership fee, donations, sale of publicity materials, and interest on deposits, among other sources. According to RSP leaders, at least 50 representatives expressed their opinions in the ‘open session’ on Tuesday. They suggested that the leadership should be protected from external attacks, and the party chair should be allowed to form a team so as to ease the party’s operation.Vice-chair Swarnim Wagle presented a brief explanation on the ‘policy paper’ endorsed by the party’s Jaleshwar meeting last year.Acting General Secretary Kabindra Burlakoti presented a proposal for amending the party statute. Burlakoti proposes three vice-presidents and joint general secretaries, including a woman in each position.Apart from the treasurer and spokesperson, all the office bearers are also proposed to be directly elected.Though the party called its first national conference to discuss a wide array of issues, the report submitted by the parliamentary special probe committee on Monday dominated the discourse.The report on crisis-ridden cooperatives, submitted to the government via the Speaker of the House of Representatives, also concerns the fate of RSP President Rabi Lamichhane. Though the report does not directly implicate Lamichhane in the cooperatives fraud, it links him to the spending of the money illegally sourced from multiple cooperatives. The report also recommended prosecuting four individuals: Lamichhane, then-managing director of Gorkha Media Network; chairman Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai; board member Kumar Ramtel; and initial founder Chhabi Lal Joshi.Lamichhane was accused of diverting funds from multiple cooperatives to run the media company that operated the Galaxy 4K Television channel, which ceased operations last year. Rai and Lamichhane co-founded and jointly ran the media company before Lamichhane joined politics in June 2022.Lamichhane also claims to have held 15 percent of sweat shares in the company, which he sold after completing the legal procedure as he quit the television. However, the committee’s investigation found those claims to be false. Denying his involvement in the cooperatives scam, Lamichhane and other RSP lawmakers attacked the Nepali Congress for its repeated stance that led to the parliamentary committee’s formation.RSP leaders at the meeting tried to establish that Lamichhane had got a clean chit from the probe.Before concluding the conference on Wednesday, Lamichhane will present his political report. This conference is also expected to schedule the party’s first general convention for May next year. \nThe parliamentary special probe committee formed to investigate crisis-ridden cooperatives has concluded that Rabi Lamichhane, the chairman of the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), was involved in misusing millions of rupees received from cooperatives when he was the managing director of the now defunct Gorkha Media Network.The committee’s report recommends that the government take action against former deputy prime minister and home minister Lamichhane for the act.Lamichhane was accused of diverting funds from multiple cooperatives to run the media company that operated the Galaxy 4K Television channel, which ceased operations last year. Chairman GB (Gitendra Babu) Rai and managing director Lamichhane co-founded and jointly ran the media company before Lamichhane joined politics in June 2022.“During our investigation, we found that the investment in the Gorkha Media Network had been made with the money diverted from various cooperatives,” Ishwari Devi Neupane, a Nepali Congress member of the probe committee, told the Post. “Although Lamichhane has been found guilty of using funds from cooperatives for Gorkha Media Network, it could not directly link him to the rerouting of cooperative funds.”Lamichhane has consistently denied any involvement in the misappropriation of cooperative funds. However, the report of the parliamentary special committee formed to investigate crisis-ridden cooperatives has concluded that Rs650 million from five credit cooperatives, including the Pokhara-based Surya Darshan Cooperative, Butwal-based Supreme Cooperatives, Chitwan-based Sahara Cooperatives, Birgunj-based Sano Paila Cooperatives, and Kathmandu-based Swarnalaxmi Cooperatives, were diverted to the Gorkha Media Network.The committee’s report, which was submitted to Speaker Devraj Ghimire at a meeting of the House of Representatives on Monday, recommends prosecuting four individuals, including Lamichhane, the then managing director of Gorkha Media Network; chairman Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai; a board member Kumar Ramtel; and initial founder Chhabi Lal Joshi.“Those in the roles of shareholders, board members and managing director can’t evade accountability and liability for the money that comes into the company,” reads the report submitted by the chair of the probe panel, CPN-UML lawmaker Surya Thapa. It states that the bank account holders who operate the account should be responsible for how the money in that account is used. “Since Rai, Ramtel, Lamichhane and Joshi are seen to be using the money that came into the company from various cooperatives, we recommend that the Nepal government prosecute them in accordance with the prevailing laws,” the report further says. An Interpol diffusion notice has been issued against Rai, who has been on the run and is believed to be abroad. Ramtel is in judicial custody.The probe panel has also recommended that the government make binding legal arrangements for the payment for share purchases and sales. The report also suggests that the government make proper legal arrangements concerning sweat shares and prompt relevant agencies to address the matter. Lamichhane claimed to have held 15 percent of sweat shares in the company, which he said he sold after completing all legal procedures. However, the committee’s investigation found those claims to be false. “Forgery was involved in the purchase and sale of sweat shares,” Lekhnath Dahal, the CPN (Maoist Centre) lawmaker and committee member, told the Post. The report states that the office bearers of the media company had used forged documents while transferring the company’s shares, and recommends that the government carry out further investigation of the matter and take necessary actions.However, RSP leaders had their own interpretation of the probe committee’s report.RSP chair Lamichhane and Vice-chair Swarnim Wagle, while leaving the House meeting, claimed that the committee had acquitted Lamichhane of the allegations that he was involved in embezzlement of cooperative funds. They said they welcome the committee’s report, and noted that Shishir Khanal, the RSP member in the committee, did not even write a note of dissent “as the report had exonerated the party chair”.RSP leaders also claimed that the accusations from other parties had been proved false.Manish Jha, acting spokesperson of the RSP, said that even Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa had claimed that Lamichhane was directly involved in diverting cooperative funds to the media company using his own signature. Jha claimed that the report disproves this accusation. “We had acknowledged that Gorkha Media Network had diverted the cooperative funds for its operation, which the report confirms,” he added.“We had assumed the report might do great damage to our party, but we are pleased how it has been presented,” Jha told the Post. “Things will become clearer after the full report is made public.”But committee members don’t agree with the RSP leaders’ interpretation. “They may have assumed that their party chair would be directly implicated, but that did not happen,” said Dhruba Bahadur Pradhan, a Rastriya Prajantra Party (RPP) lawmaker and committee member. He said that not being directly implicated does not mean that he was not involved in the scam. “Our law does not permit the rerouting of the cooperative funds to a private company, yet Lamichhane and the company did exactly that. He can be prosecuted for this,” Pradhan, who is also a former chief of Nepal Police, told the Post.Legal experts say that Lamichhane could face prosecution under four different laws based on the findings of the parliamentary special inquiry committee’s report. “Lamichhane could be charged the cooperative fraud case under the Cooperative Act, fraud and duping under the National Penal Code, organised crime cases under the Organised Crime Prevention Act and money laundering case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act,” advocate Om Parkash Aryal told the Post.The committee was formed on May 28 and had four-point terms of reference to investigate cooperative funds embezzlement. Among the four-point ToR, the cooperatives linked with the funding of the now-defunct Gorkha Media Network will also be probed.The probe panel had three months to complete its work from the first day of the committee meeting which was held a week later after the committee’s formation. When the committee could not complete its task in the given time, Parliament had extended the term by 15 days, to September 22. But the committee has submitted its report before the expiry of the extended time. Speaker Devraj Ghimire forwarded the report to the government for implementation after committee chair Thapa submitted it to the House of Representatives on Monday.The lower house formed the special inquiry committee after the erstwhile main opposition party Nepali Congress obstructed House meetings continuously for weeks demanding the formation of such a panel.The Congress, along with the RPP, demanded a parliamentary special probe committee to investigate the cooperative embezzlement, claiming involvement of the then deputy prime minister and home minister Lamichhane. The then ruling parties the CPN (Maoist Centre), the major coalition partners UML and Lamichhne’s RSP were against the demand.Lamichhane, host of a popular television show, founded the RSP in June 2022. RSP is the fourth largest party in Parliament with 21 lawmakers (including deputy speaker).He is linked with multiple controversies. His case regarding the use of dual passports is sub judice. He was also stripped of his position as a lawmaker and minister for home affairs in early 2023 after he was found guilty of contesting the 2022 election without proper Nepali citizenship. Lamichhane had obtained an American green card, but contested the election in Chitwan-2 without first re-acquiring Nepali citizenship. He won by a huge margin. Lamichhane, who had been stripped of the lawmaker position on charges of using dual citizenship, got reelected as the lawmaker from the same constituency in a by-election held in 2023. Similarly, the parliamentary special probe committee has recommended that the government investigate Jyoti Gurung, former wife of Nepali Congress Vice President and lawmaker Dhan Raj Gurung. Jyoti Gurung, who was a board member of Miteri Cooperative, is accused of mishandling more than Rs120 million of the cooperative’s funds. “The Miteri cooperative chairman, Khumbharaj Gurung, had complained to the committee about Dhan Raj Gurung and his wife over their mishandling of the cooperative's money,” Pradhan said. “So the committee report has recommended further investigation into the Gurungs.” On Friday, the special committee members visited the Miteri Cooperatives office at Mahalaxmisthan in Lalitpur, to discuss the matter with its chairman.After being charged with embezzling the cooperative’s funds, Congress Vice President Gurung, speaking in Parliament on September 10, called for a thorough probe to clear his name. Pradhan said the committee found no evidence implicating lawmaker Gurung in the misappropriation. Cooperatives are considered to be self-regulatory bodies, but in Nepal a large number of cooperatives are being operated arbitrarily by a handful of operators. The committee report also suggests that the government should establish a strong regulatory body to look after the financial aspect of cooperatives.Apart from chair Thapa the committee had six other members. Sarita Bhusal from the UML; Dilendra Prasad Badu and Ishwari Devi Neupane from the Congress; Lekhnath Dahal from Maoist Centre; Sishir Khanal from RSP and Dhruba Bahadur Pradhan from RPP. \nPanic gripped locals in ward 12 of Chandragiri Municipality, Kathmandu, on Thursday morning after a suspicious object was found in the locality.The suspicious object was spotted in front of Balambu Secondary School, sparking fears of a bomb threat.Locals informed the police, and a bomb disposal team from the Nepal Army arrived at the scene. According to the NA Directorate of Public Relations and Information, the team disposed of the suspicious object, which turned out to be a pressure cooker.   \nKathmandu Metropolitan City has extended the area to prohibit building any structure on either side of the rivers in its territory.In a notice on Wednesday, the city office stated that construction of any structure has been barred on the additional 20 meters from the existing prohibited area.According to the metropolis notice, if the city has, under the existing rule, prohibited any construction on 20 meters from the area marked as river, the prohibited area will now be altogether 40 meters on either side of the waterway.The metropolis said the decision was taken based on a recent Supreme Court verdict that directed the authorities concerned to prohibit construction within an additional 20 metres from riverbanks in the Kathmandu Valley.Currently, construction is permitted only 20 metres beyond major riverbanks in the Kathmandu metropolis.The notice issued by the metropolis states, “No construction will be permitted on an additional 20 metres of land on either side of the river, and ongoing construction will be halted.”It has also asked one and all not to release contaminated water, including sewage, into Bagmati River and its tributaries. “Private and government buildings, as well as commercial properties, must install soak pits for groundwater recharge,” it said. “Waste must not be disposed of in the rivers. Non-compliance will lead to legal action under existing laws.” \nThe rhythmic beat of the Dha echoes through a Bhaktapur alley, blending with the energetic footsteps of dancers. Bhaktapur, which sees jatras and festivals round the year, is no stranger to music, dance and celebrations. But this is not an ordinary occasion. The performers in question are Lakhe dancers who are reviving the Ranjitkar Lakhe dance after a century.The young dancers are preparing for Indra Jatra this year, where mask-clad Lakhe dancers roam the streets to rid the community of hardships and suffering. Lakhe, demon deities revered as protectors of people and crops, are thought to reside in the demonic mask. As the dancer dons the mask, the spirit is said to take over.Bhaktapur was once a key site for the Ranjitkar Lakhe performances, but the art form vanished from the city after the 1934 earthquake.“Bhaktapur suffered the most damage during the 1934 earthquake,\" says Ganesh Ram Ranjit, treasurer of the Ranjitkar Group’s Bhaktapur branch. “The destruction left residents struggling to recover for a decade, making it nearly impossible to perform the costly Lakhe dance.”The Ranjitkar Group discovered the extinct dance in the year the group was established. They located a Lakhe temple in Bhaktapur that had closed after the earthquake. After two years of research, they learned that performing the Lakhe dance was seen as a good omen in Bhaktapur and involved hosting community feasts. However, the high cost of this tradition forced many to sell their properties, rendering it unfeasible in the city’s post-earthquake conditions. Over time, the dance was abandoned as more lands supporting these cultural events were lost during rapid urbanisation.“There was a significant decline in our engagement with our cultural heritage,” says Rabi Shakya, a sculptor and Lakhe dance teacher training the new dancers. “The encouraging change now is the strong interest from the new generation, which is making it possible to revive intangible heritage like this dance.”After 100 years, the Ranjitkar Lakhe Dance is making a return to Bhaktapur at this year’s Indra Jatra.“It’s challenging to accurately re-enact the dance since it hasn’t been seen in a century,” Shakya notes. “As a sculptor, I drew inspiration from Bhaktapur’s revered Shree Navadurga Bhawani to create the Lakhe’s mask.” Similarly, the dance was choreographed by studying Lakhe dances from Kathmandu, Patan, and Banepa within the Ranjitkar community, and combining them with traditional steps from Bhaktapur Lakhe dances.“As for the musical instruments, we are using traditional instruments like Dha, Dhime, and Ponga, which are said to excite the Lakhe,” says Rajendra Maharjan, Lakhe dance teacher and musician.Maharjan is one of the experienced Newari arts teachers working to revive the lost Lakhe dance. He is involved in training young students in cultural arts and is now dedicated to the Ranjitkar dance training, with the students practising together nearly every day.“Becoming a Lakhe performer involves more than just wearing the costume and mask,” said Sudin Ranjit, a Lakhe dance student. “We must train extensively with our teachers, and it demands a lot of hard work.”To Ranjit, a resident of Bhaktapur, the training is more than learning a new craft; it is a matter of protecting culture. Growing up only interested in instruments, he slowly understood how important continuing cultural practices like Lakhe dances is for their community.“The dance will not only bolster Bhaktapur’s cultural pride but also boost tourism and create jobs,” says Dr Purushottam Lochan Shrestha, a professor and researcher specialising in Bhaktapur and Newari culture.Shrestha notes that reviving the dance would offer employment to everyone involved, from the dancers and the sculptor making the masks to those participating in the rituals. “Economic centres throughout the city, from small businesses to large industries, will benefit from the influx of tourists attracted by the Lakhe dance,” Shrestha adds, commending the Ranjitkar group's initiative.Once the Ranjitkar community revitalises the Lakhe dance, the Ranjitkar group plans to set up a new Guthi house with a fresh community fund and organise annual events for the dance.“The Lakhe dance won’t let them separate,” Shakya remarks.In today’s globalised world, where identity often merges into a homogenised blend, shared cultural practices provide a sense of connection and belonging. This new Lakhe dance embodies that spirit of togetherness for the community involved.“Reviving the dance after 100 years,” Shakya says, “is about preserving our culture for the next 300 years.” \nThe Lions Club of Kathmandu Corporate, Nepal MD325-D has felicitated various personalities as part of its endeavour to recognise the contribution of the individuals and business entities for the society.As part of its campaign, the Lions Club of Kathmandu honoured Prateek Pradhan with Social Journalism Award, Sylapa T Rimponche with Social Spiritual Award, Erika Gurung with Social Player Award, Ramesh Corporation with Social Corporate House Award, Rajendra Malla with Social Corporate Leader Award and Rajesh Hamal with Social Celebrity Award.Likewise, Chandra Ghimire is honoured with Social Bureaucratic Award, Binod Das with Sports Management Award, Anil Kedia with Social Academic Award, Mohan Ojha with Social Management Award and Surya Nepal with Corporate Social Responsibility Award.The Lionism embarked in Nepal in 1971 as the Lions Club of Biratnagar under the stewardship of former Prime Minister Matrika Prasad Koirala.The Lions Clubs International says it has over 2,000 clubs operating across the nation. \nThe government has declared a public holiday in the Kathmandu Valley on Sunday to celebrate the Bhoto Jatra.On the occasion of the festival, a public holiday has been declared in the three districts of Kathmandu Valley [Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur], according to a statement by Narayan Prasad Bhattarai, spokesperson for the Ministry of Home Affairs, on Friday.The government announces a public holiday each year on this occasion.The month-long chariot-pulling festival of Rato Machhindranath concludes with the displaying of a bhoto (a jewel-studded vest) at Jawalakhel, Lalitpur. It is an annual cultural and religious ritual of displaying the black jewel-studded vest believed to be of then Nagraj, the serpent King.Machhindranath is revered as the God of rain, good harvest and prosperity. Paying homage to Lord Machhindranath is believed to bring good luck and fulfil one’s wishes. \n\n\nThe Nepal-India Chamber of Commerce & Industry (NICCI) participated in the Bodhgaya-Nalanda Conference—BIMSTEC Plus, which was organised by the Synergia Foundation in collaboration with Nalanda University in Bihar, India, on September 12.Sunil KC, vice-president of NICCI, representing the Nepali delegation, attended the three-day event. KC emphasised the importance of cultural and economic integration among BIMSTEC nations while speaking at the event session entitled, ‘Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) Plus: Shared Cultural Values and Futures’.He highlighted how the BIMSTEC bridges South and Southeast Asia, fostering a deep-rooted connection through shared historical values and economic ties.KC underscored the vital role of culture in regional development, noting that shared cultural heritage can drive economic collaboration, particularly in sectors like tourism, education, and creative industries. He called for greater cooperation to promote tourism, leveraging the region’s rich cultural diversity, and boosting local economies.The conference explored the vision of \"BIMSTEC Plus\" to extend partnerships beyond the region, creating wider economic corridors and addressing global challenges such as climate change, digital innovation, and economic resilience. \nGeopolitical conflicts and tensions are fuelling a surge of economic fragmentation and protectionism around the world, which would hit poor nations in particular, experts warn. In addition, there is a climate crisis, which would require huge amounts of money to cushion the shocks.But who will fund it?The Horizons Dialogue series, organised by the British Embassy and UK International Development in Kathmandu on Wednesday, brought together national and international experts to discuss the challenges and opportunities in Nepal’s development in the next ten years amid geopolitical conflicts and growing climate crisis. Experts have warned that the geopolitical conflict's repercussions could cause Nepal to lose foreign grants, loans, and other support.“We [Nepal] have seen a decline in international cooperation after the Covid-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine war and conflict in the Middle-East countries,” said Kalpana Khanal, senior research fellow leading the Center for Economic and Infrastructure Development Policy at the Policy Research Institute. She was speaking on the theme ‘Navigating Nepal’s Fragility’.Khanal said, “The world is experiencing violence, interstate wars, and economic turbulence, with some countries adopting more anti-globalisation policies and populist regimes. This could cause a decline in international cooperation.”What will happen then? Khanal explained that such a scenario would force Nepal to focus on revenue collection to repay loans and interest rather than funding critical projects.“Currently, Nepal is channelling 22 percent of its total revenue towards debt servicing. In such a situation, if we do not receive the grant and rely more on loans, it will hinder overall development,” said Khanal.Nepal's public debt is 43 percent of its total GDP, half of which is made up of external loans and support.“We can potentially face a decline in international cooperation, as global lenders and development partners may channel funds towards the war-ridden countries like Ukraine and Palestine,” Khanal said.Khanal said climate change, amid geopolitical tension, may hamper projects built with foreign loans. “Many of the ongoing hydropower projects in Nepal rely on foreign loans. The devastating floods and landslides due to extreme weather conditions increase the project's costs. This, too, impacts public debt,” Khanal said.The global war will bring not only disaster but also hunger.Khanal said Nepal’s food inflation increased sharply after the Covid-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war. “It’s high time the country focused on food security.”According to a report prepared by the organisers, over the next decade, changes in the demand for Nepali workers, particularly in India and the Middle East, or geopolitical events that limit labour migration could have major impacts on the national development trajectory.Climate change, disasters, and health crises could also have significant economic impacts. In recent years, disruptions to agriculture from droughts and floods have led to sharp rises in food prices, the report said.Nearly 60 percent of Nepal’s population relies on agriculture, and two-thirds of that group is engaged in subsistence farming. The report said that, as a result of male outmigration, women constitute 73 percent of the agricultural workforce.Over the past decades, air quality has significantly deteriorated, consistently exceeding the World Health Organization's limits. The participants say that without significant intervention, it is likely to deteriorate further in the next five years.“But hopefully, in 10 years, we have projected some improvement in some areas,” said Arun Bhakta Shrestha, senior climate change specialist and programme manager for the Regional River Basins and Cryosphere programme of International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD).Air pollution in the Kathmandu valley and the Tarai presents a growing health crisis, with around 12 percent of Kathmandu’s population suffering from chronic respiratory diseases like asthma and pneumonia, threatening to reverse reductions in infant and child mortality, the report said.Air pollution hazards will be worsened by more frequent hydrometeorological events such as droughts and heatwaves, with huge knock-on effects for the health of the population, the report said.Comparing the National Board of Diseases report of Nepal between 2011 and 2021, in 2011, malnutrition was the number one cause of death but now it's air pollution. Over 20 percent of deaths are now caused by air pollution in Nepal, which is around 42,000 deaths annually, said Dr Meghnath Dhimal, an environmental health scientist and chief research officer at Nepal Health Research Council.As South Asia is suffering from heat waves, which increase non-communicable diseases, many people are now using more chemicals than before because once the temperature goes high, the effectiveness of the insecticide goes down, Dhimal said. “As a result, more people are suffering from cancer, diabetes, malaises, and others,” he said.Climate change, air pollution, and bio-diseases may result in the epidemic of the non-communicable disease. As climate change and air pollution all cause non-communicable diseases, this share may go up to 90 percent in the next five to ten years, Dhimal said.Rob Fenn, the British ambassador to Nepal, said, “As the world grapples with climate change, Nepal is bearing the brunt despite contributing very little to global emissions.”It is vital that global action supports Nepal’s resilience and growth, Fenn said. “The UK will remain a reliable partner in helping Nepal recover from shocks, adapt to challenges, and thrive,” he said.“Our programmes will continue to invest in climate resilience, sustainable economic growth, and health systems that serve all communities.”  \nAlong with dengue infection, major hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley are seeing a significant surge in cases of viral fever, flu, typhoid, and seasonal influenza in recent days.Doctors attending to the patients said that the number of fever cases has risen compared to previous months, with some patients even developing pneumonia and requiring inpatient care due to worsening health.“Around 50 percent of the patients who come to the outpatient department at our hospital are fever cases,” said Dr Rita Hamal, a consultant paediatrician at the Chabahil-based Om Hospital and Research Centre. “Some children have also been diagnosed with pneumonia and have been admitted at the hospital for inpatient care.”Experts say the rise in fever and cold before weather transitions is concerning and that the spread of the virus could be behind the surge in infection rates.They say the influenza virus causes respiratory complications, which affect the lungs. The virus spreads quickly in communities. These diseases can cause fever, cough, body aches, occasional vomiting, diarrhoea, and pneumonia.Doctors say that while the number of new cases of fever and flu has risen significantly, the exact cause of the surge still remains unclear. Many patients do not opt for various diagnostic tests, and health workers also provide symptomatic care first.“There is no specific care for viral infections, including dengue,” said Hamal. “We provide symptomatic care only. So we do not know the actual cause of the ailments.”Doctors recommend multiple tests only for patients with serious health conditions. They say that early diagnosis is crucial for preventing infection, and patients recover quickly if treated in time. However, according to experts, the severity of the disease and the number of deaths increase if seasonal influenza cases are not diagnosed promptly.“We don’t know the actual cause of the surge in fever, flu, and other ailments,” said Dr Sumit Agrawal, spokesperson at the Kanti Children Hospital. “Almost all hospital beds have been occupied by ailing patients, and the number of fever cases has risen significantly recently.”The hospital, which also serves as the national referral centre for ailing children, said that over 1,200 children seek care daily, and 30 to 40 percent of them are fever and flu cases.Doctors at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital and Patan Hospital also said that the number of fever and flu cases has risen significantly of late.“Along with dengue cases, the number of people suffering from viral fever, flu, typhoid and other infections has increased at our hospital as well,” said Dr Yuba Nidhi Basaula, director at the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital in Teku, Kathmandu. “Most of the beds in our hospital have been occupied. The number of dengue infection cases has also surged lately.”Doctors at Patan Hospital said that in addition to fever cases, patients with diarrhoeal infections and other water-borne diseases are also seeking care. They expect more cases in the coming days, as fever and flu cases usually spike during weather transitions.Even though fever and flu cases are rising significantly, authorities remain unaware of the exact cause of the surge in infection rates.“When the cause of ailments is not ascertained, it becomes difficult to provide effective care,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at Sukraraj Hospital. “The number of people infected with influenza could be several times higher than those seeking care at hospitals, as many people suffering from influenza-like illness do not seek treatment unless they become serious.”A recent report by the Nepal Statistics Office also shows that cold and fever remain a significant concern, with an increase from 43.7 percent in 1995/96 to 51. 5 percent in 2022/23.Doctors say more people get infected with viruses during seasonal changes, as most viruses—adenovirus, rhinovirus, influenza virus, and even coronavirus—become active during these times, particularly in winter.However, they say this does not mean respiratory viruses do not spread at other times. People are continuously infected with respiratory viruses in other seasons as well, and those with weak immunity could become more severely affected by infections.Doctors urge everyone to take precautions against these risks and ask authorities to step up surveillance to determine the real causes of influenza-like illnesses. \nThe licences of hundreds of health facilities of Bagmati Province have not been renewed for the past two years, as the provincial government has yet to enact its public health law.Health officials say even if the licences of most private health facilities have expired, those facilities are not illegal.They, however, concede that no agency in the country is monitoring activities of the private health facilities and their service quality due to the failure to renew the licences.“Other provinces across the country have already passed the provincial public health act to govern private hospitals up to 200-bed capacity and other health facilities,” said Dr Arjun Sapkota, chief of the Health Office, Kathmandu. “We hope that the Bagmati provincial government will introduce the provincial public health act soon, which will clear the way for licence renewal of the institutions fulfilling the due procedure.”There are over 1,000 private health facilities, including 52 private hospitals, in Kathmandu district alone. If all the health facilities in the province are counted, they will number in thousands, officials said.Operators of private health facilities, including the Association of Private Health Institutions of Nepal (APHIN), an umbrella organisation of private hospital operators, complained that they are deprived of banking services, importing health equipment and other facilities due to the apathy of the relevant agencies to renew the licences.“We recently held discussion with officials at the Health Office, Kathmandu and drew their attention to the non-renewal of licences,” said Dr Padam Bahadur Khadka, chairman of the Private Health institutions of Nepal. “Health facilites have been facing several problems including problems in importing equipment and banking facilities, among others.”Health officials say that monitoring of private health facilities operating in the districts of the Bagmati Province has been halted due to non-renewal of licences. They say that the condition of hospital equipment, manpower, hospital waste management, power back-up, operation theatres and emergency wards also need to be monitored but remain unattended for years.Studies show over 95 percent private hospitals have been operating out of rented residential buildings that have no proper patient safety measures. Nor are the facilities equipped to withstand disasters like earthquake and fire, and to handle patient flow caused by such disasters and disease outbreaks.Buildings that are currently being used by private hospitals were built many years ago and do not meet the basic criteria as they aren’t equipped with emergency entry and exit points, fire escapes, and waiting areas, among others. Majority of private hospitals also lack the required human resource and force staff to work overtime in the absence of enough personnel.Inspections carried out in the past show that most hospitals are also found to be lacking in hazardous waste management systems. The inspection team of the Ministry of Health and Population and local units found that most hospitals segregate hospital waste but the waste is then sent to private companies for management, where household waste is mixed up with the hospital waste. When hazardous waste produced from hospitals is left untreated, chances of infection spreading in communities are high.“Once the provincial government brings the provincial public health act, we will monitor the health facilities and renew licences,” Sapkota said. \nA 24-year-old student has died from the Nipah virus in the southern Indian state of Kerala, a local medical official said on Monday, and 151 people who came into contact with the victim are under observation to prevent the spread of the deadly virus.This is the second death caused by Nipah in Kerala since July. Nipah is classified as a priority pathogen by the World Health Organization (WHO) because of its potential to trigger an epidemic. There is no vaccine to prevent infection and no treatment to cure it.Parts of Kerala are among those most at risk globally for outbreaks of the virus, a Reuters investigation showed last year. Nipah, which comes from fruit bats and animals such as pigs, can cause a lethal, brain-swelling fever in humans.The student started showing fever symptoms on September 4 and died five days later, said R. Renuka, a district medical officer in the town of Malappuram, located in northern Kerala.The testing of a blood sample from the victim sent to the National Institute of Virology in Pune confirmed a Nipah infection on September 9, Renuka said.Five other people who have developed primary symptoms of a Nipah infection have had blood samples drawn and they were sent for tests, she said, without saying if they were primary contacts of the dead person.Nearly 151 people are being monitored for any symptoms after they were found to be on the primary contact list of the victim, who had come from Bengaluru, she said.This is the second death from a Nipah infection in Malappuram this year after a 14-year-old boy succumbed in July.Nipah has been linked to the deaths of dozens of people in Kerala since its first appearance in the state in 2018. \nDusit Princess Kathmandu is organising a five-day trout festival at its SOI restaurant. The dishes will be available for order from 12:30 pm to 10:00 pm every day till August 30. In celebration of Nepal’s rivers and lakes, which provide an ideal environment for high-quality trout, the Director of Culinary Food and Beverage Service, Chef Utpal Mondal, and his team at Dusit Princess Kathmandu have crafted a menu showcasing the flavours and versatility of locally sourced trout. “As the festive month of Shrawan ends, people focus on healthy and nutritious food. Trout, rich in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and essential minerals, offers a heart-friendly option that checks all the boxes from a nutritional and culinary standpoint,” says Mondal.He adds that the goal of the culinary event is to offer their guests a rare opportunity to experience a wide variety of trout dishes they wouldn’t typically find at home.The event menu features twelve unique dishes, six of which are drawn from diverse culinary traditions across continents. Three dishes are inspired by oriental cuisine, while the remaining three highlight flavours from Nepal and India. The menu has been designed to include various dishes, from soups and starters to main courses, including Mexican, Italian, Continental, and Thai flavours.While discussing the event’s highlights, Mondal said, “The celebration presents a unique opportunity for guests to indulge in a diverse range of trout-based dishes, something they wouldn’t typically have the chance to experience elsewhere.” \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story.

Their only win of the League 2 came in February at the TU Cricket Ground during the inaugural Tri-Series (involving the Netherlands and Namibia) against the Dutch, who now lead the table with 12 points after six wins and two losses.Nepal were looking to bounce back from their first ever one-day international defeat against Canada on Monday and showed some improvements, with their captain Rohit Paudel also finding firm after dismal innings in his previous four outings.Nepal, invited to bat first after losing the toss, made a shaky start to their innings as they lost Arjun Saud (5), who opened in place of out-of-form Kushal Bhurtel, Aasif Sheikh (11) and Bhim Sharki (11) cheaply and were scratching their head at 31-3 after 13.1 overs.But Paudel scored a half-century and rebuilt the innings with Aarif Sheikh, who came to bat first for the first time since Nepal’s second leg loss against the Netherlands in February, to take the total past 100.After Aarif fell to Shakeel Ahmed, who was making his ODI debut, in the 36.3 overs making 35 runs off 88 balls, Paudel departed playing 72-ball 60 that included two fours and four sixes.Jha, promoted to number six, then continued the revival scoring 53 runs off 35 balls. His aggressive knock featured three boundaries and five maximums.Sompal Kami then smashed quick 20 off eight balls at the end to guide Nepal to 220-9 from 50 overs.This was also the first time Nepal have crossed the 200-run mark in the League 2 this edition.In response, Kashyap Prajapati (36 off 52) and Jatinder Singh (41 off 49) added 75 runs for the opening wicket to give Oman a solid start.Sandeep Lamichhane finally ended their stand in the 17th over trapping Singh lbw and Aarif dispatched Prajapati in the 20th over to halt the Oman progress.Jha then returned with the ball and dismissed Oman captain Aqib Ilyas for 29 and Aayan Khan for nine.Karan KC next took the wickets of Pratik Athavale (26) and Khalid Kail (17).Jha then sent back Shoaib Khan (26) and Fayaaz Butt (8), and bowled a maiden over in the 48th over that also included the wicket of Jay Odedra (5), leaving Oman needing 10 runs from the final two overs with one wicket remaining.Karan KC gave away just two runs in the 49th over but Shakeel and Kaleemullah robbed Sompal Kami with two fours to lead Oman to 223-9.Jha finished his 10-over spell with 5-47 that also included two maidens.The victory gave Oman their second win in five matches and put them in sixth position with five points.Nepal next play Canada on Sunday and Oman on Tuesday in the reverse fixtures of the Canada Tri-Series. \nInter Milan escaped Etihad Stadium with a surprise 0-0 draw against Manchester City in the Champions League on Wednesday, exacting a small measure of revenge for their narrow loss to Pep Guardiola’s side in the 2023 final.Both teams squandered numerous chances in a breathless back-and-forth affair. City were largely stalled by Inter’s impressive discipline in defence, while Simone Inzaghi’s Inter, who were dangerous on the break on a nervy night for both sides, were wayward with their finishing.“We faced a really difficult team,” Guardiola said. “I’m still really, really satisfied for the game we played, especially with how (Inter) defended, they are masters of that, so big, they help each other unbelievably. So you cannot expect to create a lot of chances.”Inzaghi was similarly pleased with his squad’s night.“I said ‘well done guys’, they put in a giant performance,” the manager said. “I asked them to play exactly as they did. We all know Manchester City, what they are capable of, we knew we had to pull out all the stops, play a great game and we did it.”City’s goal machine Erling Haaland, who would have become the fastest player in history to record 100 goals for a European club had he scored, will have to wait to achieve that milestone.The Norwegian, who has nine goals in four Premier League games this season, narrowly missed a couple of first-half chances including a header that keeper Yann Sommer jumped up to grab on the line, and a hard, low shot that rolled just wide of the post.Henrikh Mkhitaryan had City fans breathing a huge sigh of relief when he missed a late chance, launching a rocket just over the bar from about eight metres out, then holding his head in disbelief.At the other end, Ilkay Gundogan elicited huge groans from City fans after twice failing to convert with close-range headers in the dying seconds. He launched the first one straight at the keeper, with the second one glancing just over the bar right before the final whistle.City fired 22 shots to Inter’s 13 but only had one more shot on target than their visitors with five.Under the new Champions League format, teams play eight matches against eight different opponents, with the top eight sides in the 36-team league automatically advancing to the last 16, and the next 16 playing a further knockout round.It was a lacklustre performance for four-time defending English champions City, who are in a familiar spot sitting atop the Premier League table after four games with a 100% record. Inter are third in the Serie A table.One negative on the night was a potential injury to City captain Kevin De Bruyne, who appeared to pick up a knock late in the first half and did not play in the second.His team face another intense contest on Sunday when they host Arsenal, who sit two points behind them in the table.City, who edged Inter 1-0 to hoist the 2023 Champions League trophy in Istanbul as part of their treble, were eliminated by eventual winners Real Madrid in the quarter-finals of Europe's top competition last season, while Atletico Madrid ousted Inter in the round of 16. \nNepal Police Club missed their chance to leapfrog Tribhuvan Army Club to the second spot in the ANFA Women’s League after they were held to a goalless stalemate by sixth-placed Chandrapur Municipality at the ANFA Complex in Lalitpur on Wednesday.Police also had to rely on a goalkeeping heroics from Usha Nath to avoid a shock loss late in the game as the goalkeeper saved a penalty kick from Dil Kumari Magar, helping the departmental side preserve their unbeaten run in the league.The draw—second in a row and third in the season—will still have damaging consequences to Police as the outcome left them four points adrift of leaders and reigning champions Armed Police Force Club, who are on 16 points.Police have 12 points from six games.Army occupy second position with 13 points.Police were not at their best and had to wait until the 34th minute to have a clean chance at goal when Niru Thapa outran two Chandrapur defenders to set up Nirmala Upadhyaya inside the penalty area but Chandrapur goalkeeper Usha Thapa reacted quickly to save Upadhyaya’s shot.Niru also set up Anuska Sherpa with a beautiful through pass in the final minute of the first half but Chandrapur goalkeeper Thapa came to the rescue again with her quick thinking.Chandrapur came close to scoring in the injury time of the first half after a poor defending from Samikshya Ghimire allowed Sunita Sunar from an open play but she ended up shooting wide.Police almost found the lead five minutes into the break when Niru’s strike beat Chandrapur’s goalie Usha, who had come far off the post to check Ghim Kumari Gurung’s clever pass, but the shot could not find the target.Chandrapur had a golden chance to punish misfiring Police in the 71st minute from the penalty kick. They were awarded the penalty after Ghimire handled the ball inside the area but Police goalkeeper Nath stretched full length to deny Magar and saved her side from the jaws of defeat.In the later action, Karnali Province registered their first victory of the season with a 3-0 victory against Sudurpaschim Province.Bhumika Budhathoki put Karnali in front in the 24th minute capitalising on an opportunity by Garima Rai, who twisted and turned to outwit Sudurpaschim defenders before putting it on the plate for Budhathoki.Rai then combined with Budhathoki to double Karnali’s lead in the 62nd minute, before Barsha Oli finished off a counter attack to wrap up a comfortable victory.Karnali stayed in the ninth position with four points. Sudurpaschim are rock bottom after facing their sixth defeat in six matches. Bagmati Youth Club play against Waling Municipality on Thursday. \nIsrael bombed southern Lebanon on Thursday and said it had thwarted an Iranian-led assassination plot, a day after explosions of Hezbollah radios that came on the heels of blasts in booby trapped pagers, setting the foes hurtling towards war.The sophisticated attacks on armed group Hezbollah's communications equipment, which killed 37 people and wounded around 3,000 over two days, sowed disarray in Lebanon, with panicked residents abandoning their mobile phones.\"This isn’t a small matter, it’s war. Who can even secure their phone now? When I heard about what happened yesterday, I left my phone on my motorcycle and walked away,\" said Mustafa Sibal on a street near central Beirut.A distant roar in the skies could be heard in Beirut from what Lebanese state media said was Israeli jets breaking the sound barrier - a sound that has grown increasingly common in recent months.Israel said its warplanes struck villages in southern Lebanon overnight, and a security source and Hezbollah's al-Manar TV reported airstrikes near the border resumed on Thursday just after midday.Hand-held radios used by Hezbollah detonated on Wednesday across Lebanon's south. The Lebanese health minister raised the death toll, saying 25 people had been killed and 608 injured in the country's deadliest day since cross-border fighting erupted between the militants and Israel in parallel with the Gaza war last year.The previous day, hundreds of pagers - used by Hezbollah to evade mobile phone surveillance - exploded at once, killing 12 people including two children, and injuring more than 2,300.In a post on X, Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati called on the United Nations Security Council to take a firm stand to stop Israel's \"aggression\" and \"technological war\" against his country.Israel has not commented directly on the booby-trapped walkie-talkies and pagers, but multiple security sources have said the attacks were carried out by its spy agency Mossad.Israel says its conflict with Hezbollah, like its war in Gaza against Palestinian militant group Hamas, is part of a wider regional confrontation with Iran, which sponsors both groups as well as armed movements in Syria, Yemen and Iraq.On Thursday Israeli security forces announced that an Israeli businessman had been arrested last month after attending at least two meetings in Iran, where he discussed assassinating Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the defence minister or the head of the Shin Bet spy agency.Last week, Shin Bet uncovered what it said was a plot by Hezbollah to assassinate former Defence Minister Moshe Ya'alon.Israel has been accused of assassinations including a blast in Tehran that killed the leader of Hamas and another in a Beirut suburb that killed a senior Hezbollah commander within hours of each other in July.Despite the events of the past few days, a spokesperson for the U.N. peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon said the situation along the frontier had \"not changed much in terms of exchanges of fire between the parties\".\"There was an intensification last week. This week it is more or less the same. There are still exchanges of fire. It is still worrying, still concerning, and the rhetoric is high,\" the spokesperson, Andrea Tenenti, told Reuters.Israel and Hezbollah have been exchanging fire across the Israeli-Lebanon border in parallel with the war Israel has waged in Gaza against Hamas, the Palestinian militant group whose fighters attacked Israel on Oct. 7.Tens of thousands of people have had to flee the Israel-Lebanon border area on both sides. Netanyahu vowed on Wednesday to return the evacuated Israelis \"securely to their homes\".SHIFTING FOCUSThe Israeli military said its overnight air strikes hit Hezbollah targets in Chihine, Tayibe, Blida, Meiss El Jabal, Aitaroun and Kfarkela in southern Lebanon, as well as a Hezbollah weapons storage facility in the area of Khiam.Israeli media reported that a number of Israeli civilians had been wounded by anti-tank missile fire from Lebanon, but there was no official confirmation.On Wednesday, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said the war was moving into a new phase, with more resources and military units now being shifted to the northern border.According to Israeli officials, the forces being deployed there include the 98th Division, an elite formation including commando and paratroop elements that has been fighting in Gaza.Hezbollah launched missile barrages on Israel on the day after the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas, and since then there has been a constant exchange of fire that neither side has allowed to escalate into a full-scale war.However, tens of thousands have been evacuated on both sides of the border, and there has been mounting pressure in Israel for the government to get the evacuees back home. \nA Norwegian human rights foundation gave its annual prize on Thursday to jailed Cuban dissident leader Luis Manuel Otero Alcantara for his “fearless opposition to authoritarianism through art”.Four past laureates of the Rafto Prize — Myanmar’s Aung San Suu Kyi, East Timor’s Jose Ramos-Horta, South Korea’s Kim Dae-jung and Iran’s Shirin Ebadi — later went on to win the Nobel Peace Prize.This year’s Peace Prize will be announced on October 11 in Oslo.“The 2024 Rafto prize aims to highlight the importance of the work of Luis Manuel Otero Alcantara and other artists in challenging power structures and defending democracy and human rights, both in Cuba and globally,” the Norwegian foundation said in a statement.A Cuban court sentenced the artist-dissident in 2022 to five years in jail in a high-profile case that human rights groups branded a “farce” but that Cuban state media said was a fair trial over “common crimes.”The 36-year-old artist was a prominent member of the Havana-based San Isidro Movement, an artists collective that led a number of protests over two years. Many of the group have since left Cuba, alleging government repression.On Thursday, the Rafto Foundation called on the Cuban government to release him, joining similar calls by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International.The laureate is awarded a diploma and prize money of $20,000. \nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nWhat animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. \nNepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) \nThere is no doubt that the promulgation of the Constitution of Nepal, 2015, nine years ago, was a significant accomplishment. That was primarily because it represented the realisation of the decades-old national dream of being governed by a constitution drafted by a sovereign body elected by the people of Nepal. Due to its “fast-tracked” provenance, the kind of deliberations that would have granted it much greater legitimacy was sorely missing. Even so, it was a milestone in Nepal’s history.That momentous achievement was, however, marred by the somewhat contradictory turn of events in that it was adopted in the face of opposition by a large section of the populace, particularly from the Tarai. While the royalist Rastriya Prajatantra Party had expectedly voted against the republican and secular constitution, all the Madhesh-based parties had boycotted the proceedings altogether. The main grouse of the latter was the delineation of provincial boundaries, but there were also strong misgivings over the distribution of parliamentary constituencies as well as restrictions on the right of women to pass citizenship to their offspring.The whys and the whereforesWith the political space heating up amidst talk of amending the constitution following the Nepali Congress-UML pact, we appear to be headed for another round of acrimony. As per the two-party agreement, the express purpose of the amendment would be to identify the constitution’s “strengths and weaknesses and complexities that have emerged in practice” which have contributed to Nepal’s chronic political instability. Party leaders have been clear that their main target is the current mixed electoral system, particularly proportional representation (PR), which they are more than quite certain is the primary cause for the never-ending making and breaking of governments. It is a different matter that our own experience from the 1990s clearly indicates otherwise, and other countries that have adopted PR have not been similarly blighted by the kind of instability that has become the hallmark of Nepali politics.Beyond that, given the two parties’ record, there was immediate suspicion that they would try to do away with some of the more progressive elements of the constitution. The Nepali Congress leader, Sher Bahadur Deuba, has in the past hinted secularism could be up for negotiation. And while Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has maintained that any amendment would lead to an even more liberal document, given his earlier stance on issues such as inclusion and devolution of provincial authority, there are reasons aplenty to consider his assertion with a block of salt.Besides the political parties, there have been similar calls from the judicial sector as well. Two prominent recently retired Supreme Court justices who had both served on the court’s constitutional bench have spelt out the need for amendments. Anand Mohan Bhattarai believes that it should begin with the political leadership first identifying where the bottlenecks are. The second jurist, Ishwor Khatiwada, goes further and argues that each and every article of the constitution should be up for review, albeit for the purpose of improving them and not to fulfil the interests of any political party. The latter, obviously, is the crux of the problem. Without doubt, there will be some fiddling with the constitution; it is only a question of when, not if.Self-inquiry before self-interest Now that he is out of office, the Maoist supremo, Pushpa Kamal Dahal Prachanda, has suddenly felt the need to re-embrace the agenda that propelled him to power but which he had lost sight of in his extended romp in the nation’s highest offices. Thus, he says that his party would be amenable to constitutional amendments provided there are no “attempts to shrink the rights of the citizens and dismiss the achievements in the name of the constitution amendment”.Perhaps, it was the still-muted pushback that prompted Deuba to clarify that the provinces would remain, and instead, the focus would be on strengthening the provincial structure. He also said that many groups in the country will have to be provided with proportional representation in governance structure. “This country belongs to everyone,” he said somewhat sagely.The hard sell, of course, will be to the Madhesh-based parties. For instance, the president of the Tarai Madhesh Loktantrik Party, Brikhesh Chandra Lal, writes that the move by the ruling coalition could be a cover for “extreme nationalism” which would ultimately negate sub-national identities. He believes such a move “could increase the possibility of the country getting stuck in a permanent conflict”. Conflict does not necessarily mean violence, but the kind of upheaval Lal warns about will have the same deleterious effect overall. Hence, the need to tread carefully and take all sides into confidence instead of ramming through amendments on the basis of parliamentary strength.I do not think the NC-UML combine would opt for a path of confrontation. Going back to Deuba, we can take heart in his words that there was no need to distrust them since both parties have emerged out of the struggle for democracy. “Personally, I first met him [Oli] in jail. We have both fought for democracy. As parties that fought for democracy throughout our student life and jail experiences, there is no way we can go against democracy.”One can read something in his use of the now-discredited “prajatantra” to refer to democracy instead of the more-favoured “loktrantra”. But it could easily just have been a momentary lapse, attributable to his advanced age.Age did not hamper someone else in lucid expression though. In the summer of 1787, at the end of the rather raucous convention that drafted the American constitution, 81-year-old Benjamin Franklin, by then the elder statesman in the room, made a statement that rings true for all time: “I confess that there are several parts of this constitution which I do not at present approve, but I am not sure I shall never approve them: For having lived long, I have experienced many instances of being obliged by better information, or fuller consideration, to change opinions even on important subjects, which I once thought right, but found to be otherwise. It is therefore that the older I grow, the more apt I am to doubt my own judgment, and to pay more respect to the judgment of others.”Those wise words should guide our politicians even as they begin discussions on changes to the constitution. We can only hope that they are capable of the same humility borne out of a lifetime of self-enquiry that Franklin articulated so eloquently. \nAs a child growing up in the early 1990s, I remember learning in school about the greenhouse effect. Carbon dioxide released by burning fossil fuels traps heat near the Earth’s surface, like the glass of a greenhouse. I imagined myself on the playground, roasting inside a humid hothouse.Fast forward 30 years, and the terms have changed.For a while, “global warming” was the go-to expression for talking about rising global temperatures and the role of human activities, particularly the use of fossil fuels. It had a spike in internet searches in 2007, probably due to former Vice President Al Gore’s documentary “An Inconvenient Truth: A Global Warning,” which hit theatres in 2006.Near the end of the Obama administration, “climate change” became the most common term. It’s now trending in Google searches more than global warming. Both terms make the same point: Rising global temperatures have major consequences on local weather patterns and worldwide climate effects, including stronger hurricanes, droughts, floods and fires.Trending termsGoogle Trends tracks the relative popularity of internet search terms over time. The popularity of the term \"global warming\" has declined globally in recent years, while \"climate change\" has risen.However, the words we use to discuss these effects can make a large difference in how people understand the risks and the need for more sustainable choices.What’s in a name?I’m a linguistics researcher currently living on Mayotte Island, off the coast of Madagascar, where I study climate change knowledge among local populations and the language they use to discuss it.Local fishers in Mayotte struggle to talk about the phenomenon because there is no established terminology for it. What my colleagues and I have learned offers some insight into the difficulties people in many cultures have with understanding climate change.In the grand scheme of climate change education and sustainability efforts, this seemingly minor problem of translation is in fact symptomatic of a larger underlying issue regarding the relationship between humans and their environment.In fact, when we dig deeper into the challenges of communicating climate change across cultures, two factors come into play: spiritual beliefs and notions of time.Spiritual language can overlapSpiritual and religious beliefs can play an important role in how climate change is understood and even named. For example, the translation for the term climate in Inuktitut, an Inuit language spoken in Canada, is “sila.” However, sila also refers to wisdom, the spirit, the earth, and the universe. It is something sacred to be revered.Seen through the lens of this second set of definitions, sila is effectively impossible for people to influence. It is beyond humankind’s reach to change the cosmos. As a result, communication aimed at promoting awareness of climate change becomes politicised in Eastern Canadian Inuit languages.My colleagues and I encountered similar challenges while discussing possible future efforts to slow down environmental destruction caused by climate change in Mayotte.The Maore fishers we interviewed, many of whom were of deep Islamic faith, often responded with “Inshallah,” or God willing, when questioned about efforts the community could make in the future to address the problem. They saw these climate change-related events as out of their hands, as something only God could interfere with.Different understanding of timeSecond, we might think that time is objective and therefore shared across cultures. But as Albert Einstein argued, time is relative.Time is not only relative scientifically speaking but also culturally. For example, the ancient Greeks had more than three types of time, one of which we still use today, Kronos, or linear time—think chronological order. We have all but forgotten Aion, or sacred, eternal time, and Kairos, or cyclical time.Notions of time play an important role when thinking about climate change since the heart of the phenomenon involves a slow, continuous change over a long period. We cannot see climate change happen with the naked eye, because it occurs over years and decades. Of course, we can see its effects on weather patterns, including extreme heat waves and heavy downpours.Getting people to think about time in a way that simultaneously thinks about the now, and a “then” in the distant future proves to be challenging in many cultures.For example, researchers studying sustainability efforts in the Maldives Islands have come up against this very issue. While discussing time, many local residents think in terms of the now and the near future, whereas policymakers must think about longer-term effects on a larger scale. These contrasting approaches to time have made it difficult to put into place sustainability efforts to tackle rising sea levels—a significant threat to this tropical nation of 26 atolls.Translating climate changeA first step to confronting this problem is to put language at the forefront of climate change education efforts.One youth-driven nonprofit making strides in this area is Climate Cardinals. The group’s objective is to translate climate change research into as many languages as possible. Most scientific studies and reports are in English, which can be a barrier to the many non-English speakers around the globe. In their efforts to translate this research and related phenomena, they need to think carefully about how important words are translated and understood.The United Nations and other groups are also starting to take seriously the connection between climate change scepticism and religion, including the need to reconcile eventual points of friction.For example, the Faith for Earth Initiative works with religious organisations to address the compatibility of sustainability efforts and faith. It does this by helping religious leaders connect core spiritual values, like caring and rejection of greed, to the community’s environment, thus reconnecting with nature and seeing themselves as its stewards.Finally, it is imperative to keep studying local or indigenous knowledge about the environment as related to change and time. The ancient Greeks certainly had their reasons for dividing time into multiple categories. So what were the environmental and historical influences that led them to do so?For instance, researchers and community members in Australia are looking to reconcile Indigenous knowledge with Western science. Thanks to the locals’ long-standing observations of their environment over several generations, they were able to identify local effects of climate change. Such information is often overlooked and difficult to obtain by traditional research methods.Beyond the headlinesClimate change awareness and sustainability efforts will only increase over time. Care needs to be taken to how these concepts are lived, understood and talked about in non-Western settings. Language is part and parcel of these efforts and deserves to be considered more carefully.-The Conversation Read the original article here. \nIn the past two weeks, the Federalism and Localisation Centre organised interactive programmes with chief ministers, ministers, political party leaders, principal secretaries and secretaries, and other key officials from Koshi, Madhesh, Bagmati and Gandaki provinces. Today, the Centre is organising a similar programme in Lumbini Province. This article summarises the key insights shared by the chief ministers during these discussions, focusing on three key areas: Provincial government achievements, challenges in federalism, and necessary reforms, including issues related to constitutional amendments.During a session in Pokhara, Chief Minister Surendra Raj Pandey stressed that the federal governance system cannot be effectively institutionalised without a significant shift in the mindset of political leaders. He recounted how he coordinated with then-Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal to convene a meeting of the National Coordination Council in July 2023, but lamented that the meeting yielded no meaningful outcomes. Although the meeting made six decisions to clarify the rights of all three tiers of government, Chief Minister Pandey pointed out that none have been fully implemented.According to him, while former Prime Minister Dahal was genuinely committed to federalism, many other leaders did not share the same dedication. Despite Dahal's commitment, the momentum for federalism stagnated during his tenure, as attempts were made to centralise power instead of promoting federalism. Pandey argued that it is unproductive to blame bureaucrats for the stagnation of federalism; rather, the real issue lies in a lack of political will. He mentioned that although the Madheshi and Maoist parties initially drove the federalism movement, political parties must now clearly articulate their stance if constitutional amendments are needed.Pandey asserted that provinces are the most crucial innovation of federalism, though opposition has emerged due to internal provincial issues and resource allocation. He stated, \"If we fail to deliver services, we must reassess our approach. Criticising us without the chance to perform is unfair. The federal government often does not pass necessary laws, yet we are held accountable.\" Engaging with nearly 100,000 people annually, he highlighted that this is a direct result of federalism. He called for a shift in political attitudes and expressed concern about provincial employees and police not being under provincial control, limiting governance potential.Chief Minister Hikmat Bahadur Karki of Koshi Province shared similar sentiments about the state of federalism in Nepal. He highlighted a concerning trend: Political leaders who once served at the provincial level often forget the challenges provinces face when transitioning to the federal government. \"Many who were once in the provinces during their first term are now at the federal level, but they seem to have forgotten the struggles and concerns of the provinces,\" Karki noted. He also addressed alarming calls to abolish federalism and eliminate provinces, attributing such views to a centralised mindset.Karki urged those drafting the constitution to take responsibility for its implementation, emphasising the need to prioritise federalism and constitutional reinforcement. He dismissed claims that integrating civil servants and police into the provincial system is impossible, warning that undermining federalism could lead to renewed conflict. \"If federalism is abolished, a new constitution may emerge, but it will only push Nepal towards further turmoil,\" Karki cautioned. Instead of dismantling the current federal structure, he advocated for addressing its flaws, noting that provinces operate with limited authority that must be expanded.Karki questioned the need for 25 federal ministries, suggesting that only essential ones like the Prime Minister’s Office, Finance, Defense, Home Affairs and Foreign Affairs should remain at the federal level. He criticised the disparity in resource allocation, noting that 80 percent of government employees are at the federal level, while the combined budgets of all seven provinces fall short of a single federal ministry's budget. To address this, he proposed a revenue-sharing model, with the federal government receiving 30 percent of revenue and provinces and local governments each receiving 35 percent. Karki expressed dissatisfaction with the Fiscal Commission's performance, stating it has not followed the constitutional spirit. He also highlighted the challenges of administrative federalism, where many civil servants resist transfers. Despite these issues, Karki acknowledged progress in infrastructure development but lamented the lack of communication and advocacy for federalism. In Madhesh Province, there is a growing recognition that meaningful federalism can only be realised if the federal government allows provinces to exercise the rights guaranteed by the constitution. Concerns have been raised about the federal government's reluctance to grant constitutional rights to provincial governments under various pretexts, hindering the institutionalisation of federalism.During a dialogue on strengthening federalism held in Janakpur, Chief Minister Satish Kumar Singh highlighted positive developments in sectors such as education, health and infrastructure since the establishment of federalism. He cited these advancements as having significantly transformed the rural landscape of Madhesh, underscoring the tangible benefits of provincial governance.Despite limited rights and resources, Singh highlighted the provincial government’s commitment to establishing essential infrastructure and mechanisms for the benefit of the people. He noted that the effective roles played by provincial and local governments during the Covid-19 pandemic were crucial in saving countless lives. Singh cautioned that relying solely on the federal government during such crises would have led to dire consequences, further reinforcing the importance and relevance of federalism.While acknowledging that the rights granted to provinces are insufficient, Singh said that the provincial government has shown its presence by undertaking necessary tasks even in areas beyond its jurisdiction. For instance, despite lacking authority over basic education, the provincial government has initiated school infrastructure development. He highlighted the critical issue of the teacher-student ratio in Madhesh Province, where one teacher serves 40 to 45 students, compared to the standard of one for every 20 to 22 in the hills, raising concerns about education quality.Singh noted that 80 percent of government employees are concentrated in Singha Durbar, fostering a perception that provincial workers are penalised. He criticised the federal government's maintenance of 25 ministries, arguing that only five to seven are necessary, especially with existing provincial ministries. Singh stressed the importance of addressing flawed practices while advocating for provincial rights. He warned that if actions undermine the future of federalism, Madhesh Province would not remain silent. Calling for unity among political parties against attempts to weaken federalism, he emphasised that collaborative efforts are essential for strengthening governance in Nepal.Chief Minister Bahadur Singh Lama of Bagmati Province expressed serious concerns about the ongoing challenges the provincial government faces, particularly due to the lack of control over police administration. He underscored that a government without effective police oversight is fundamentally flawed. \"While a government may exist, its significance diminishes without a functional police administration,\" he stated.The relationship between the federal and provincial governments has been strained for some time, especially regarding police integration and civil service legislation. In light of these challenges, Bagmati Province has proactively constructed police facilities and established relevant laws. However, unresolved issues surrounding police integration continue to hinder effective governance. He acknowledged that while some changes have occurred since the implementation of federalism, they do not align with citizens' expectations. \"The hopes and desires of the people are substantial; however, managing these aspirations with current resources presents significant challenges,\" he explained. Chief Minister Lama assured attendees that the provincial government is prioritising issues outlined in the list of exclusive rights mandated by the constitution, stating, \"To date, we have enacted 80 laws that address the needs of our province.\"Lama emphasised the urgent need for improved coordination among provincial, federal, and local governments, identifying this as a primary challenge. \"Developing the necessary laws to facilitate effective collaboration among the three tiers of government is essential. Failure to do so will lead to public dissatisfaction.\"The insights shared by the chief ministers highlight the urgent need for reforms in Nepal's federal system. While progress has been made, significant challenges remain. \nWhenever there is a discussion about rural development in Nepal, access to quality education always emerges as an obvious solution, yet its implementation has often been grossly neglected. This is evident in the fact that schools in Nepal’s rural areas have for years been grappling with a shortage of qualified teachers. A recent Post report highlights how the education of students in Araniko Technical Secondary School, Dasharath Secondary School, and Jananamuna Secondary School in Karnali Province have been compromised due to the lack of qualified teachers for basic and secondary-level science and maths students. Such issues occasionally make headlines; however, little has been done to minimise the education gap. Although this is a problem in various provinces, Karnali’s community schools have suffered the most. Data from the education planning, data and research branch of the Social Development Ministry of Karnali Province shows that 626,010 students have enrolled in community schools in the province. However, of the 8,793 primary teacher positions, 644 are vacant. Further, in the lower secondary and secondary levels, 2,699 and 1,749 posts remain unfulfilled.The rural municipalities in the neighbouring Sudurpaschim province seem to be handling the problem by hiring lower-level and underqualified teachers to teach secondary-level students. This only masks the problem as the teachers won’t be able to deliver what the subject demands. In most cases, there is a lack of science, maths, and English teachers. These are major subjects that demand proper lessons and shouldn’t be taught only for the sake of teaching. However, these schools have limited options as teachers qualified to teach science and maths opt for civil service and secure a government job as they do not see teaching in rural areas as a promising career. According to the Education Development and Coordination Unit, Myagdi, seven science teachers left teaching to join the civil service in 2022. The problem stems from the government’s failure to realise that teacher availability is vital for improving education. There are little to no incentives for teachers in rural areas. Qualified teachers feel less secure in their contract-based jobs in rural areas and are compelled to move to the cities for better opportunities. Even if the teachers join contract-based positions in remote areas, they leave feeling demotivated and undervalued. Seeing the poor teaching and learning conditions in rural schools, students migrate to get a better education. The lack of teachers has, in turn, led to the lack of students in some schools. According to the Ministry of Social Development, Karnali, there are fewer than 10 students in 137 community schools in the province. There is also a growing tendency among teachers to take tuition classes rather than teach in schools as they earn more from that. Due to the distrust of schools, parents in remote areas send their children to neighbouring towns and cities for tuition. This becomes more noticeable during the Secondary Education Examination. During this year’s SEE, over 500 grade 10 students across Bajhang were studying in tuition centres, leading to a lack of students in schools and the cancellation of classes. With the inability of our education system to bridge the gap between rural and urban education, the poor SEE results should not be a surprise. The students mirror the teaching they get, just as teachers reflect the conditions they work under. So a change in existing policies for hiring teachers is warranted. More efforts should be made to retain qualified teachers in rural areas and discourage private tuition. We cannot expect better output from students unless they have good and enough teachers in their schools.  \nIt is no secret that we are taking in chemicals-laced fruits and vegetables into our kitchens and bodies. But the Nepali government reports progress, suggesting most of the food we consume might be safe. Last year, the Department of Food Technology and Quality Control tested over 63,000 samples and found only 37 of them positive for pesticides. A similar report from the Central Agriculture Laboratory indicated that 8,503 of 8,575 samples tested for carbamate and organophosphate pesticide residues were safe for consumption.These reports are far from comforting, as they include tests only for a limited number of pesticides. In reality, pesticide imports have more than doubled in the past five years in Nepal, from 169,360 kilograms in 2017-18 to 354,358 kilograms in 2022-23. According to Kantipur, a sister publication of this paper, nine kinds of pesticides are registered in Nepal. Among them, seven kinds are imported. While hundreds of pesticides fall under these groups, only two—residues of insecticide from the carbamate and organophosphate—are tested in the government’s laboratory. The rest are left untested and unregulated. Such negligence from the authorities and from farmers who knowingly or unknowingly use insecticides and pesticides has endangered people’s lives. Heavy use of pesticides leads to severe health problems. The living examples of this are the residents of Gorkha Gandaki Rural Municipality in Gandaki Province. Sixty-one people in the place are fighting cancer, and 15 more are suffering from kidney failure. People in other districts are also struggling with the immediate health effects of pesticides (dizziness, tiredness, heart attack, vomiting, headache, among others) as well as long-term effects (cancer, retarded body growth, inborn disability, etc.). The state cannot shun its responsibility to protect the lives of its citizens; the right to health is their fundamental right, too. There have been measures like declaring Karnali as an “organic province” six years ago. Yet, chemical fertilisers banned, farmers in the province were given no alternatives like organic compost and plant fertilisers to grow enough healthy crops and vegetables. Nor were there laboratories and manpower to test if the foods being produced were really organic. As yields dwindled, people became even more dependent on chemical-laden foods imported from India. The organic project, which could have been a model for the country, was instead a dismal failure. If the use of pesticides continues, a nationwide public health crisis is not far off. The examination of foods for the heck of it must stop. If the authorities really want to work in favour of consumers, they must test for a wider range of pesticides in the food imported via the open border. There must also be more labs to test these products in local units. As important is allocating more technicians for this work, which even our few laboratories lack. All these measures seem a little too much to ask but they are all worth pursuing in the long run. At stake are the health and wellbeing of millions of Nepali. Experts also highlight the lack of knowledge and awareness among farmers about the use of pesticides—and local levels can play a key role in making them aware of their downsides. The more we educate them, the better we control the use of chemicals. \nFormer Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister and current chair of the Rastriya Swatantra Party Rabi Lamichhane has desperately tried to evade responsibility for his role in the misappropriation of cooperatives funds. Yet the mounting pile of evidence suggests his clear culpability. The parliamentary special probe committee was specifically formed to look into his involvement in the siphoning of money from various cooperatives into the Gorkha Media Network, of which he was the Managing Director. If the feelers coming from the committee members are any sign, Lamichhane will be held accountable for his crime. Yet corruption in Nepal is not limited to Lamichhane or his party. If Lamichhane deserves to be investigated and, if found guilty, punished, so should members of any other political party, irrespective of the positions they occupy. Credible evidence has emerged of the involvement of Dhan Raj Gurung, the Nepali Congress Vice-president, in the embezzlement of funds from a Lalitpur-based cooperative. Gurung reportedly helped his ex-wife, Joyti Gurung, embezzle around Rs12.5 million. Similarly, there are accusations that Risikesh Pokharel, the CPN-UML leader who is also the chair of Parliament’s Public Accounts Committee also helped his wife, Anjala Koirala, embezzle as much as Rs120 million from a Morang-based cooperative. What is interesting about the cases against the senior Congress and the UML leaders is the state’s apparent collusion in shielding the two. For instance, the operators of Miteri Savings and Loan Cooperative had filed complaints against 11 people, including Gurung, for misappropriating funds. But the Bagmati Province government has excluded his name in the list of the possible culprits it has sent to the Central Bureau of Investigation of Nepal Police. (The province has Bahadur Singh Lama of the Congress as its chief minister.) Likewise, the Cooperative Registrar Office of the Koshi Province has excluded the name of Anjala Koirala in the list it has forwarded to the police. This is even though the victims of the cooperative had flagged her as one of the operators involved in fund embezzlement. (Koshi province has Hikmat Kumar Karki of the UML as its chief minister.) How seemingly the whole state apparatus is being employed to shield the political leaders from the two ruling parties is shocking. No wonder the government is facing allegations of bias and vindictiveness. On Saturday, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli spent much time fulminating against the Maoist Centre, new political forces, the royalists of various hues as well as Kathmandu's mayor. Yet there was little in terms of introspection. How does he expect people to take either him or his government seriously when it is seen as protecting the corrupt and the compromised people? Rather than making big promises, Oli and his government would be better served if they are seen to be fairly applying the rule of the land and working in public interest. The cooperatives crisis is assuming alarming proportions. It has the potential to do serious damage to the national economy—besides adding untold miseries to hundreds of thousands of poor cooperatives victims who stand to lose everything if prompt measures are not taken to bring fraudulent cooperatives operators to book. If the Oli government plays with the cooperatives’ fire, it could find itself engulfed in the inferno.  \nNepal is marking its ninth Constitution Day on Thursday. The country’s two largest parties—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—formed a coalition government a month ago with a commitment to reviewing and amending the constitution. In this context, Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal and Binod Ghimire sat down with constitutional expert Purna Man Shakya to discuss the good and bad aspects of the constitution amendment process.The Congress and the UML have floated a proposal to amend the constitution. Is the time ripe to make changes in our statute?Generally, constitutions are reviewed after around a decade of their implementation. So, we have come to the stage of reviewing whether our constitution has functioned properly. However, the sudden announcement of the amendment is premature, as this is a serious business. In our case, the constitution can’t be amended just based on the interest of one or two parties. It requires a national consensus. There should be an understanding among the political parties represented in Parliament. And, a sort of consensus even among the people’s level is important as there was huge public involvement in making this constitution. Sentiment of various communities must be respected while making any changes in the national charter. What can be the modality of seeking consensus at the people’s level? Should a draft be prepared and opened up for debate?While making changes in the constitution, some issues might be technical and not of interest to common people. But if any changes are made in policy issues that can alter our country’s structural dynamics, the concerned communities must be consulted. Just the present strength of the political parties represented in Parliament is no guarantee that they truly represent people. For instance, the Maoists emerged as the largest party through the election in 2008. But it has been shrunk to a distant third in the House. However, we can’t conclude from this that the people have discarded the party’s agenda. The Maoists might have been discredited due to their activities and failure in delivery but people might still favour the agenda they once championed. Similar is the case with other parties. Therefore, we have to consider broader consensus both in Parliament as well as the people’s level.How challenging is it to enter the constitution amendment process?Any amendment calls for a two-thirds majority in the House of Representatives as well as the National Assembly in the federal parliament. If an issue is linked to provincial authority, it should be endorsed by the majority [four] of seven provinces. So, this is not easy. Therefore, the parties should tread carefully.You mentioned earlier that constitution amendments without a review process is not a right step. Could you elaborate?The right way is to first have broad understanding among the top leaders of political forces on the issues and then constitute a panel of experts to conduct a comprehensive study on that. Such studies are conducted through two methods—doctrinal and non-doctrinal. The doctrinal method analyses related literature and principles on theoretical approach while the non-doctrinal method studies the public sentiments and opinions through surveys and interactions, and comes up with certain methodologies with the help of subject experts. Through such study, the experts identify the issues and recommend the ways to the politicians. This is the right process.There are also arguments that reviewing the constitution without even bringing it into full-fledged implementation is wrong. Based on the practice during these years, we have concluded that certain provisions didn’t work properly. It is true that we are talking about making changes in the constitution without even implementing certain provisions. First we have to give the system an opportunity to work in a full-fledged way. Then, we can evaluate whether it worked. Any move to dissolve the system without properly implementing it will create divisions and invite another conflict. A question that is often asked: Is there a problem with our constitution or with our politicians? People can change the constitution but the constitution can’t change the people. Therefore, a constitution should be developed also on the basis of the nature of people in the country who use it. If our political parties and the politicians had reformed themselves, we might not have had to discuss constitutional changes time and again. We should have made the system strong for more effective checks and balances and made leaders and officials more accountable. The ruling parties reason that the constitution amendment became necessary to ensure political stability.When a federal government is changed, its aftershocks are immediately seen in all seven provincial governments. It directly impacts development and other activities across the country. It’s a flaw in our party system but we have to find a solution in the system. We see people raising voices for two things—stability and retirement of old politicians. As Nepali politicians never retire voluntarily, we have to address it through the system. Direct election of executive head can be one way to address this problem. People have found local governments more effective than federal and provincial governments. It is because chiefs and representatives of local governments are directly elected and they can serve the full five-year term.Once people are given the right to elect heads of government, they won’t elect old faces such as KP Oli, Sher Bahadur Deuba and Prachanda [Pushpa Kamal Dahal], who have been tested multiple times. It will serve two purposes—first, it gives stability and second, it allows popular leaders to emerge in place of the old ones. The old leaders have maintained control over national politics through their huge party organisations. But when people directly elect presidents and chief ministers their grip over party organisations can’t be decisive in national politics. For that we have to amend the constitution.However, again, an expert team needs to thoroughly study the pros and cons of such changes. But what I can say based on the general study of public perception is that we can first go for direct election of executive heads at the provincial level. In the next phase we can go for direct presidential election at the federal level.What went wrong in the practice of the three-tier federal system?While adopting federalism, the basic idea was to allow the local governments to oversee local matters while the provincial governments would handle wide ranges of issues related to agriculture, industry, forest, education and health, etcetera. If the two sub-national governments handle these things, people don’t need to come to the centre seeking solutions to their problems. In such a scenario, the federal government can focus on important affairs such as foreign relations, defence, telecommunication, currency, national infrastructure projects and inter-provincial affairs. Such division of powers would automatically create specialisation in the respective governments.But the federal system is not implemented as per that spirit. Provinces aren’t allowed to exercise their rights. People are still travelling to Kathmandu all the way from remote districts even for basic things. The constitution has mandated the provinces to maintain law and order in their respective provinces but the federal government hasn’t allowed them to have their own police forces. Provinces without police have become like administrative units. The centre has a huge bureaucracy in Kathmandu. It is high time that the centre delegates authority to provinces as per the constitutional spirit. Federal lawmakers have huge interest in local development activities because it is directly related to their election. They don’t want to lose this influence. The interest of federal lawmakers however contradicts with the constitution.There is also a belief that the local level has authority in areas where they can’t work effectively, for instance they are mandated to oversee the education system up to grade 12 while provinces don’t have much role. Do you think such jurisdictional matters need to be reviewed and provinces should be given more authority?That’s right. First of all, we should be clear that there is no point in adopting a federal system if we don’t want provinces because we had central and local levels even in the past. Provincial layer is an integral part of federalism. So, we have to think about transferring certain rights from local to provincial level because the local units don’t have expertise to oversee education up to grade 12 on their own. Our local units are traditionally trained in local development activities. But now they are entrusted with the responsibility of not only overseeing education and health issues but also with legislative and judicial functions. They haven’t been able to play that role. We should think about transferring some roles from local to provincial levels. Likewise, the centre should be ready to allow the provinces to exercise their rights bestowed by the constitution. It is time to strengthen the provinces.You said direct election of executive heads in provinces could end instability at the provincial level. But what if a popular leader got elected chief minister but other political parties won majority seats in the provincial assemblies? In such a situation, the rival parties may not help the chief minister pass a budget or policies from the assembly.Yes, there are strengths and weaknesses of all systems. Such problems can be resolved because we see similar situations in other countries as well. Parties can’t prolong the deadlock in the House because they will be blamed for the impasse. One basis is that our local units are doing well under executive heads. So, we can practise it for a decade in the provinces and then apply it to the federal level based on that experience.Many forces and groups that aren’t happy with the present constitution, which was basically a compromise document. Once the constitution amendment process is open, they are certain to revive their demands. Will the situation be manageable?If the rights of historically marginalised communities are curtailed, they will certainly retaliate. If you try to go against the federal republic system and policy of inclusion, it may invite new conflicts. The proportional representation system is not a problem. Leaders made it unpopular by misusing it. We should find solutions to stop its misuse. We shouldn’t forget that this constitution is not only a constitution but also a key document of our peace process. This is not perfect but it was essential to end the conflict. Many say that while making a document of compromise, our constitution hasn’t followed the principles of constitutionalism. For instance, the hearing system is something unusual in a parliamentary system. As a constitutional expert, do you think we should also think about fixing such deviations?You are right. When we couldn’t change the people, we tried to add additional features as a measure to check the wrongdoings. Our leaders make appointments in key constitutional bodies guided by their personal and partisan interests. We copied the hearing practice from the presidential system with a view to check the leaders’ arbitrary appointments. It hasn’t been that effective. Therefore, we have proposed to give continuity to the hearing for political appointments but not in the appointments of judges because lawmakers don’t have the expertise to examine judges’ competence. Since lawmakers are mainly guided by the party’s whip and top leaders’ instructions, it rather increases political interference even in the judiciary. We have thus proposed to stop the hearing process for judges’ appointments.Many say that the judiciary hasn’t been federalized even though all other sectors have been restructured as per the three-tier federal system. Why this exception for the judiciary?Oh, you dragged me to a sensitive topic. One thing we shouldn’t forget is that we adopted a federal system not to unify small countries. We were already a united country. We adopted it to better manage our social diversity by involving all the communities in the governing system. We at the same time have to safeguard the country from disintegration. Judiciary, the national army and Nepali language are our institutional arrangements that can play a unifying role. Therefore, we didn’t make much changes in these three aspects.Some instances show that Nepal’s federalism might have been a bit more effective had the judiciary worked proactively. For instance, the court hasn’t decided even the cases filed by provinces years ago. What do you think about the judiciary’s role in this connection?Yes, those cases are still undecided. In the Constituent Assembly, the Maoist party had registered a proposal to form a separate constitutional court. The justices who were leading the judiciary at the time opposed the idea. It was later rejected. Then the idea to have a separate constitutional bench was included as a compromise deal. But it has failed to work effectively. It failed to decide election-related disputes. We have to review its jurisdiction. They have decided certain cases when there is public pressure. For instance they decided cases like House dissolution because there was constant public scrutiny. But they haven’t shown any interest in other important cases where constitutional interpretation is needed. Of late, a strong opinion is being built in favour of forming a separate constitutional court. These issues are being discussed seriously. This issue may emerge if the constitution amendment process begins.What we can infer from your analysis is that the constitution amendment process is not that easy. What are the basic things that should be and can be done in the constitution amendment at this stage?First, we should change the form of governance at the provincial level and go for a directly elected executive head. With this there will be no change in government in provinces after changes at the centre. The governments in provinces can work for five years with certainty. Second, we can transfer the powers that the local units have failed to exercise to provinces. And, the centre should allow the provinces to exercise the concurrent rights. By doing this the centre can reduce the overwhelming burden on it. While the provinces can play an implementing role, the federation can play a supervisory role. These things need to be fixed. We need some amendments to the constitution and some new laws for this. \nNepal has often earned global recognition for its progressive policies and inclusive stance on LGBTQIA+ rights. But do the global accolades Nepal has earned in terms of its progressiveness reflect the actual experiences of queer people here? The Post’s Aarati Ray sat down with Manisha Dhakal, executive director of the Blue Diamond Society and a leading advocate for LGBTQIA+ rights in South Asia for over 23 years.Nepal is often hailed for its progressive stance on queer rights, both in South Asia and globally. With over two decades of queer rights advocacy, how accurate do you find this portrayal?Many activists and commentators do describe Nepal as being progressive on queer rights. While this is partly true, especially when we consider the legal frameworks, the reality at the grassroots is quite different. On the one hand, Nepal’s constitution recognises LGBTQIA+ identities. Articles 12 and 18 mandate that “gender identity” be acknowledged on citizenship certificates, while Article 42 promises affirmative action and participation in government for sexual and gender minorities. Court decisions in Nepal, too, have been favourable for LGBTQIA+ rights, and unlike many former British colonies with Section 377-type laws that criminalise queer communities, Nepal has no such legal barriers. So, indeed, there are opportunities for activism, and progress has been made, particularly in terms of legal recognition. But, again, the rights enshrined in the constitution and affirmed by the courts have not been realised at the grassroots level. We are stuck with a limited focus, primarily on citizenship. The state claims that we’ve been given the right to identity and legal recognition, but even this is not fully realised. For example, the process of obtaining citizenship based on self-identification remains difficult, with government officials still unclear on how to implement these provisions. The broader narrative of Nepal being progressive is built on a superficial understanding of the situation.In August, Nepal’s Supreme Court ruled that Rukshana Kapali, a transgender woman, should be legally recognised as a woman on all documents without medical verification. How does this decision impact the future of LGBTQIA+ rights in Nepal?Rukshana’s case is a prominent victory, highlighting the judiciary’s support for LGBTQIA+ rights, especially compared to those of the executive and legislative branches. This ruling lays a strong foundation for similar future cases and will undoubtedly help in future activism. However, it’s important to note that the decision applies only to Kapali, meaning others will still need to go through the courts to have their gender identity legally recognised. How long must transgender individuals continue to endure lengthy court processes just to obtain citizenship?Even outside the courts, the bureaucratic hurdles—from medical reassignment surgeries to invasive checkups and long delays from the CDO (District Administration Office) to the Ministry of Home Affairs—can take years, with no guarantee of getting preferred names on legal documents. In many cases, even after completing the process, the names are inaccurately changed, such as altering Ram to Rama instead of the preferred name, like Manisha.We [Blue Diamond Society] get 15-20 complaints each year, primarily from transgender women, regarding difficulties in obtaining citizenship.The Supreme Court’s recent decision on same-sex marriage in Nepal has attracted global attention and gotten a positive response. Are there any limits to the court’s decision?After a long and arduous process, we secured temporary registration for same-sex marriages. On June 28, 2023, the Supreme Court, in the Pinky Gurung vs. Government of Nepal case, issued an interim order instructing the government to temporarily register same-sex marriages, including for those with “other” gender markers. That said, the Civil Code adopted in 2017 still defines marriage as a union between a ‘man’ and a ‘woman’.We, as a community, are pleased with the government’s temporary registration process. Yet it falls short of offering full marriage rights, including those related to property, adoption, and tax exemptions. While the court’s decision sets a supportive precedent, lack of clarity about the rights associated with the temporary certificate leaves many in limbo. So far, only around five couples have registered, and many in the community are hesitant to do so.The question remains: Can this temporary registration truly grant us the same recognition as heterosexual marriages? While the decision has garnered global praise, the LGBTQIA+ community on the ground continues to feel cheated of true equality. Our ultimate goal is to amend the Civil Code so that marriage is defined as a union between two individuals, rather than being restricted to one between male and female.Why do many court decisions on queer rights in Nepal, like of same-sex marriages, remain in limbo? Is this due to the government and courts trying to appease both conservative and progressive groups, or is it just a performative gesture of inclusivity?There are multiple factors at play. I think some responsibility also falls on activists. For example, when fighting for legal recognition since 2008, we should have advocated not only for the “third gender” or “other” but also for individuals who have transitioned from male to female or female to male. What’s more, policymakers and bureaucrats still lack awareness about human rights principles related to minority groups like the LGBTQIA+ community. Even though Nepal has ratified international conventions on human rights, these commitments have not been prioritised by lawmakers, which leads to this state of limbo and half-hearted inclusivity.As for the internal thought processes of bureaucrats and lawmakers, it’s hard to say. Many of them might still believe that the LGBTQIA+ community shouldn’t be granted full rights, so they engage in performative actions—appearing supportive on the surface to attract global attention but hesitating to fully advance our rights. This could explain why progress seems to stall midway.Queer rights have received some legal recognition. But how are they reflected in terms of social and cultural acceptance in Nepal?Legal changes and social acceptance need to go hand in hand. If we only focus on legal reforms without addressing societal attitudes, there will be no real change. We’ve seen this play out—there is legal recognition of gender identity, and temporary registration for same-sex marriage is available. Yet people struggle to fully realise these rights because of deep-rooted discrimination within families and society.In Nepal, a socially and culturally driven society, where family, relatives, and festivals play a major role, social acceptance is often more important than legal acceptance. When it comes to cultural acceptance, biases still persist. For example, it feels like we’re allowed to express ourselves openly only during the Pride Month in June. When we try to participate in other celebrations like Teej or Gaijatra, society often reacts negatively, asking why we need to “spoil” their festivals. This shows that social change is still lagging, despite the progress in legal rights.You mentioned that the queer community is often given the surface level of legal recognition. How is the state of the exercise of fundamental rights for LGBTQIA+ people in Nepal?Labelled as ‘gender and sexual minorities’, our broader struggles are ignored. When we raise concerns about poverty, food insecurity, or unemployment, the response we often get from government institutions and stakeholders is, “This isn’t our issue; it’s a gender problem.”We are just as much a part of society as anyone else. Issues like climate change, housing, and poverty affect us too. We want to be included in solutions, whether it’s participating in climate programs or being involved in community initiatives. Unfortunately, lawmakers and stakeholders often overlook that we are just as human as heterosexuals, with needs that go beyond legal recognition on paper.What are some aspects of the queer community that have not received enough attention in media narratives, and what tends to be unnecessarily highlighted?As I’ve mentioned before, the narrative surrounding our community often focuses heavily on issues like citizenship, while overlooking other important aspects of our lives. What’s missing is the correct representation of our contributions in various fields. Many LGBTQIA+ individuals are doctors, and experts in different professions, yet their accomplishments are only rarely acknowledged or represented. Instead, the focus often falls on the unfortunate image of some members of the community begging on the streets, which goes viral on social media.Another issue is the way we are predominantly associated with sex and sexuality. While these are important aspects of human identity, we are much more than that. We have other needs and rights that deserve attention. Unfortunately, the media tends to fixate on sexual aspects of the LGBTQIA+ community, reinforcing stereotypes. It’s time for the media to move beyond this narrow portrayal and include us in broader discussions that reflect the full scope of our lives.How has the current narrative of progressiveness in Nepal impacted real change for the LGBTQIA+ community?It’s time to move beyond this narrative of progressiveness. True progress should lead to further development, not be a barrier to it. Unfortunately, the current narrative seems to be stagnating.For instance, when we raise issues with the government, the response often is, “We’ve already given you the right to citizenship. You’re getting citizenship now.” Even when I travel people sometimes ask, “You’ve got citizenship, right? Things are becoming progressive.” This narrative of progressiveness has become an excuse for the government to claim they’ve done enough and to avoid further action.This surface-level progressiveness is used to showcase Nepal as forward-thinking internationally, but it hasn’t translated into real change for people at the grassroots. It also impedes activists’ efforts by providing the government with a shield against criticism.
