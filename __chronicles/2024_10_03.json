Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nThe National Disaster Management Executive Committee under the home ministry on Monday announced relief schemes for families of those killed or missing in monsoon-induced floods and landslides. During a meeting on Monday, the committee decided that the families of those unaccounted for after ten days will be provided with relief equal to the amount given to the families of the deceased.The government has also decided to form a special task force within 15 days to assess the losses caused by rain-induced disasters across the country. The decision comes with the intent of offering timely compensation for those affected by the floods and landslides that are the result of incessant rains from September 27. As per the decision, relevant ministries will promptly commence the reconstruction of government and public buildings and transport infrastructure, including roadways and bridges.The committee also decided to provide temporary housing grants within seven days for the families that lost their homes. The committee stated that the district disaster management committees, led by the respective chief district officer (CDO), would facilitate and coordinate with the local and provincial bodies to implement these decisions.“The relief distribution programme is already underway,” Dil Kumar Tamang, information officer at the home ministry, told the Post. “As per the decision of the National Disaster Management Executive Committee’s meeting, we have provided Rs200,000 to each bereaved family, and temporary shelters are being arranged for those in need.”Due to the monsoon-induced floods and landslides, 238 people have lost their lives across the country as of Wednesday evening. Last week’s incessant rain caused water levels in Kathmandu’s major rivers, including Bagmati, Bishnumati, and Dhobikhola, to rise, flooding nearby settlements. Areas such as Nakkhu, Balkumari, and Gwarko in Lalitpur were also inundated after the Karmasasha, Nakkhu, Godavari, and Bagmati rivers breached their banks.In Bhaktapur, the Hanumante river crossed the danger mark, inundating several riverside settlements and displacing hundreds of people.Although the government official claimed that relief distribution had already begun, Min Kumar Magar, who resides along the Bagmati riverbank at Thapathali in Kathmandu, told the Post on Wednesday evening that he and other flood victims have yet to get any assistance. “Some police officers came by on Monday afternoon to collect data, but we are yet to get any relief,” Magar told the Post. Not only Magar, but Kumar Thapa, another flood victim who lives in Nakhipot, Lalitpur, also said his family had also not received any relief announced by the government. Madhav Prasad Dhungana, Kathmandu’s deputy chief district officer and spokesperson for the District Administration Office, says the district’s relief distribution is coordinated with the Nepal Red Cross Society and various municipalities. As relief is being distributed by area, it is possible that some people might not have received it yet, but they will soon, Dhungana said.“Soon after the heavy rainfall started on Saturday, our district administration office started distributing the relief,” Dhungana told the Post. “At present, we are focussing on helping those affected by heavy rains.”Dhungana said that as the government has adopted the one-door policy for relief distribution, all the relief that reaches needy people comes through the government.Relief distribution in Lalitpur district has been coordinated with local representatives, says the assistant CDO, Kalpana Ghimire Nepal, who is also the spokesperson for the Lalitpur CDO office. According to her, the Lalitpur administration has taken twin approaches while distributing aid to those in need. “Based on the request from local bodies, we have arranged for relief materials to be sent to the local units,” Nepal told the Post. “We have also started providing Rs200,000 to the families of the deceased from the disaster management fund.” Assistant CDO Nepal said they distributed relief money in the Godavari area on Tuesday and in the Lalitpur metropolitan area on Wednesday, and that the distribution will be continued for the next few days.Meanwhile, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has criticised the government’s relief distribution efforts as less than proactive. An NHRC official, citing reports, said the relief distribution is not satisfactory even in most areas within the Kathmandu Valley, let alone in remote parts of the country. “While some people may have received relief from certain organisations, the information sent by our team members from the field suggest that many people within the Kathmandu Valley have not gotten any help,” an NHRC official said.“When giving any kind of help, priority should be given to marginalised groups,” the deputy spokesperson of NHRC Shyam Babu Kafle told the Post. “In similar situations in the past, we have seen political parties giving priority to their own cadres for relief, and we have cautioned the government not to let that happen this time.” \nLight to moderate rainfall is likely in some places of Bagmati Province, especially in the hilly region on Thursday, while districts of Koshi Province could witness rainfall on Wednesday night as well.The Meteorological Forecasting Division of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology attributes these weather disturbances in the two provinces to the partial influence of a low-pressure system developing over northeast Assam in India, and monsoon winds.“Light to moderate rainfall is a normal phenomenon during the monsoon season,” said Sanjeev Adhikari, a meteorologist at the division. “We want to reassure everyone that there is no need to panic, and also request that they rely on the Met office’s updated bulletins.”Many people living in the cities and planning to return to their home villages during Dashain are concerned about news circulating on various online portals regarding the possibility of heavy to very heavy rainfall.“While some isolated instances of heavy rainfall could occur, we define heavy rainfall as amounts exceeding 50 millimetres in 24 hours,” said Adhikari. “Continuous rainfall is unlikely in the next two days, and conditions will improve after Friday.”Some districts of Koshi—Udayapur, Morang and Sunsari in particular—witnessed heavy rainfall on Wednesday. The Met office said the rainfall did not occur continuously in those areas.Many people who witnessed last week’s monsoon mayhem still worry about the rain and its aftermath. At least 228 people have been confirmed dead, while 25 others are still missing in the floods and landslides triggered by record-breaking precipitation in the three starting Thursday evening. As many as 159 people have been injured, and more than 14,802 others moved to safe places, according to Nepal Police. Floodwaters submerged many parts of the Kathmandu valley and other districts, with landslides and floods destroying homes, vehicles, bridges, and highways.Since the monsoon entered the country on June 10, at least 460 people have died and 84 others are missing. The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority (NDRRMA) said that 378 people have been injured in landslides, floods and lightning strikes, and 3,939 families have been affected.The monsoon season in Nepal typically starts on June 13 and ends on October 2. This year, however, the clouds from the south entered Nepal from the western region on June 10, three days ahead of the usual onset date. Last year, the monsoon began on June 14, a day before the normal date.The monsoon season, which delivers around 80 percent of the country’s total annual rainfall, generally lasts about 105 days. But, in recent years, it has been taking longer to withdraw.As predicted before the onset of monsoon, Nepal recorded above-average rainfall this season.Nepal is one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to the climate crisis and has witnessed extreme weather events over the past decade and a half.Evidence suggests that Nepal's maximum temperature is rising at a greater rate (0.056 degrees Celsius per year) than the global average of 0.03 degrees Celsius per year.Experts say extreme weather events—excess rainfall in a short period, continuous rains for several days after the monsoon, dry spells, droughts, below-average precipitation, and above-normal winter temperatures—have become more frequent in Nepal.Evidence suggests that maximum temperatures in Nepal are rising faster, at 0.056 degrees Celsius a year, compared to the annual global average rise of 0.03 degrees Celsius. \nNepal and Bangladesh on Wednesday agreed to sign an energy trade deal on Thursday.A Joint Steering Committee (JSC) meeting, jointly chaired by Nepal’s Energy Secretary Suresh Acharya and Senior Secretary at the Power Division, Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources, of Bangladesh, decided to sign the power sales agreement between the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA), Bangladesh Power Development Board and NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam amid a function in Kathmandu on Thursday, the Ministry of Energy said in a statement on Wednesday evening.As per the agreement, Bangladesh will import 40 megawatts of electricity from Nepal. The Indian side has also been involved in the trade deal as Nepal’s electricity will be transmitted to Bangladesh through the transmission infrastructure on the Indian territory. Nepal and Bangladesh are not territorially linked to each other.Nepal is estimated to sell 144,000 MWh (megawatt-hour) electricity in five months—mid-June to mid-November—at the rate of 6.4 US cents a unit.The Nepal-Bangladesh meeting also agreed to develop the Sunkoshi-3 hydropower project in a collaborative participatory modality between Nepal, Bangladesh and India, according to the ministry. They have decided to finalise a joint venture agreement in the next meeting.Originally scheduled for July 28, the signing was postponed due to political tension and change of government in Bangladesh.The two sides have also agreed to conduct a technical and financial feasibility study of the proposed cross-border transmission line for energy trade between Nepal and Bangladesh. For now, Nepal will transmit the energy to India through the 400KV Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur cross-border transmission line and before India transmits the equivalent to Bangladesh. The NEA will calculate the quantum of exported energy at the Mazaffarpur point. The NEA estimates an earning of around Rs330 million for the country through the sale. \nGoods arriving from the north and south for Dashain have been stuck in bordering areas for the last five days. As the major highways remain obstructed following the incidents of floods and landslides caused by the late September rains, there is little hope that the consignments will arrive in Kathmandu ahead of the festival.Hari Bahadur Gautam, president of the Nepal Traders Association, said that more than 300 containers have been stuck on the Tatopani and Kerung borders points as of Tuesday. Most containers carried festive and winter goods, especially readymade garments.The border with China has been closed since Friday due to the floods and landslides caused by incessant rainfall.Dashain shopping starts from Ghatasthapana on Thursday, the first of the ten-day festival. Most containers of goods have been stranded in Khasa and Kerung in China’s Tibet, and at the customs on the Nepali side, said Gautam. The landslides and floods have damaged the roads on both sides.He said that road repairs would not be possible before Dashain. The Bhotekoshi river swept away the Bailey bridge at Larcha near Tatopani, Nepal’s second largest customs on the northern border.Kumar Shrestha, ward chairman of Bhotekoshi Rural Municipality-2, said that the road is being repaired by putting a hume pipe in Larcha after two days of negotiations with the rural municipality.“We are trying to open the road by using excavators. It will take 2–3 days to reopen the road,” Shrestha said.Shrestha said temporary arrangements have been made by laying iron poles in the bridge for the movement of locals.“Though there is no authentic data on the containers stranded at the China border, traders say they have received only 5 percent of the goods they ordered for Dashain,” Gautam said.After the impact of the Covid-19 and the subsequent economic slowdown, traders hoped for sales recovery. “The flood and landslide, however, has stalled the cargo movement, shattering traders' hope,” Gautam said.In Kathmandu, most traders had stocked their goods on the banks of the Bagmati and Manohara rivers, which have also been flooded. Traders said that price hikes of goods are unavoidable to recover the losses.Due to floods on the Liping river, a large part of the bridge connecting Liping and Kodari has been damaged. Maintenance work has started, according to the Bhotekoshi rural municipality.“The traders have requested the government to immediately rebuild the Larcha and Liping bridges. Rajendra Sangraula, senior vice president of Nepal Freight Forwarders Association, said goods from India have been halted in the border areas as the road network connecting Kathmandu has been damaged. He said that since the transporters have hiked their freight charges, goods, particularly apparel, would be expensive in the Kathmandu market.The transporters have hiked the cargo fare of 12-wheeler trucks from Rs70,000 to Rs130,000 for Birgunj-Kathmandu. A loaded container that used to take a maximum of two days to arrive in Kathmandu from southern border points may now take days. The association said the exports are also stuck on the road.“Due to the high risk, transporters are not allowing their trucks to carry goods. Drivers are worried. This situation may increase the transit cost and, as a result, increase the prices,” Sangraula said.“The highway needs to be repaired promptly as further delays may increase the overall logistic cost,” Sangraula said.According to the association, the Tribhuvan Highway, which is currently blocked for cargo movement, used to see more than 100 goods-laden trucks coming daily from major customs like Birgunj, Biratnagar, and Bhairahawa.According to the Department of Customs, Nepal’s imports declined by 1.16 percent to Rs1.59 trillion in the last fiscal year, 2023-24, which ended in mid-July. The exports, too, declined by 3.03 percent to Rs152.38 billion in the same period.In the last fiscal year, Nepal imported goods worth Rs298.77 billion from China, while exports were Rs2.58 billion.Nepal imported goods worth Rs996.68 billion from India, while exports were Rs103.17 billion during the review period. \nNepal defeated Oman by 56 runs in the fifth match of the Canada T20 Tri-Series at King City on Wednesday.Nepal, after being put into bat, posted 157-7 in their allotted 20 overs as skipper Rohit Paudel played a crucial knock, remaining unbeaten on 56 from 44 balls, hitting two fours and four sixes.Contributions from Anil Sah (11), Aasif Sheikh (16), Dev Khanal (18), and Kushal Malla (19) helped Nepal build a competitive total.Fayyaz Butt was the standout bowler for Oman, taking three wickets for 23 runs.In response, Oman struggled against Nepal’s disciplined bowling attack and were bowled out for 101 in 17.5 overs. Zeeshan Maqsood top-scored for Oman with 35 off 30 balls, while Aqib Ilyas contributed 22. Oman lost wickets at regular intervals and failed to build momentum.Kushal Bhurtel picked three wickets as Sandeep Lamichhane, Rohit Paudel and Rijan Dhakal claimed two wickets each. \nNepal’s immediate neighbors India, China and other friendly countries have assured Nepali authorities of all possible cooperation and support to Nepal in the wake of the recent floods and landslides that killed at least 238 people.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday sent a letter to Prime Minister KP Oli expressing condolences for the loss of lives and pledging all possible assistance, said a senior official at the Prime Minister Office.“India stands with Nepal in this hour of grief,” said Modi in his letter, adding, “As always, India is also ready to support and extend all possible cooperation to Nepal.”In his letter, Modi has mentioned that India will support Nepal in the search, rescue and reconstruction bid of Nepal.Naveen Srivastava, Indian ambassador to Nepal, handed the letter to Prime Minister Oli, while the Indian Embassy in Kathmandu delivered copies to the Prime Minister’s Office and Ministry of Foreign Affairs.Likewise, Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi on Wednesday sent a message of condolences to Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba, over the severe floods and landslides in Nepal.According to the Chinese official news agency, Xinhua, Wang, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee said he was shocked to learn that heavy rainfall in Nepal has triggered severe floods and landslides, resulting in significant casualties and property losses.He also expressed deep condolences over the deaths and sincere sympathies to the bereaved families and the injured, according to the news report. China is willing to provide support within its capacity, said Wang.“As a friendly neighbor linked by mountains and rivers, China has always shared weal and woe with Nepal and is ready to provide support and assistance within its capacity for Nepal’s flood relief in light of its needs,” said Wang.  The Chinese Red Cross Society has already donated $100,000 to the Nepali for Nepalis affected by the recent floods and landslide.Chinese Ambassador to Nepal, Chen Song handed over a cheque of $100,000 to Nepal Red Cross Society through the Ministry of Home Affairs on Wednesday.Likewise, British King Charles III also sent a message of condolence to the President Ramchandra Paudel.Charles said he and the Queen were “heartbroken” at the “devastating effects” on the Himalayan nation and that the UK stands ready to help President Paudel support those in need, according to the British news agency, Press Association.The disaster came just ahead of the country’s biggest festival Dashain, which begins on Thursday, when people return home to celebrate with their families.The King said: “My wife and I were heartbroken to see the devastating effects of flooding and landslides in Nepal over the weekend. Many in the United Kingdom have strong, deep and personal ties to Nepal, not least through the Gurkhas and their outstanding contribution to the British Army.“Together with the British public, we send our deepest condolences to those who have so tragically lost their loved ones, and who continue to be affected. As always, the United Kingdom stands ready to help you support those most in need.“As many in Nepal begin to mark important festivals, I particularly hope that families might still be able to come together, even at such an incredibly difficult time.” Likewise, Russian President Vladimir Putin has sent condolence telegrams to President Paudel and Prime Minister Sharma Oli over the deaths caused by landslides and floods, the Russian embassy in Kathmandu told TASS, a Russian news agency.Federation Council Speaker Valentina Matviyenko and State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin also sent condolences to the Nepali authorities.\"Russian national flags were lowered at the Russian embassy in Nepal and at the ambassador's residence in Kathmandu as a sign of mourning for the victims of the natural disaster,\" the Russian diplomatic mission said.Several Kathmandu based diplomatic missions have also expressed concerns over the recent floods and landslide in Nepal and expressed their readiness to support the government of Nepal. \nConcerns are growing about a possible rise in home deliveries in several districts after road links were disrupted last week’s devastating floods and landslides.Officials at the Ministry of Health and Population said that they are aware of the growing risk and have instructed agencies concerned to start risk mapping.“The risk of home deliveries has grown due to last week’s monsoon havoc,” said Dr Bikash Devkota, director general at the Department of Health Services. “We have instructed agencies concerned to monitor the situation and report back. We also held discussions with our development partners about the risks and requested them for help.”At least 233 people have been confirmed dead, while 22 others are still missing in the floods and landslides triggered by record-breaking precipitation in three days starting Thursday evening last week. As many as 169 people have been injured, and more than 17,120 others were shifted to safety, according to Nepal Police. Transport links to many districts have been disrupted by the floods and landslides that swept the roads and bridges in many places. Health facilities and birthing centres in many places were also destroyed in the disaster.Maternal health experts say that the recent disaster could cause a severe setback to maternal and child health and also affect institutional delivery rate.“Due to the disruption in vehicular movements, many pregnant women may not be able to reach birthing centres,” said Nisha Joshi, a public health official at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “Pregnant women and new mothers who have lost family members or property in the disasters would be unable to reach hospitals or health facilities for childbirth.”Health officials say that they have cautioned health workers in the affected areas about the heightened risk of an increase in home deliveries, which increases the risk of maternal and newborn deaths.A report on maternal mortality carried out by the National Statistics Office in 2021 showed that for every 100,000 live births, 151 women still died from maternity-related complications. Similarly, the institutional delivery rate has reached around 80 percent. Maternal death rate and home delivery rate are very high in remote areas. “We are aware of the risk of a rise in home deliveries, which poses a threat to the health of mothers and their newborn,” said Joshi. “We have requested the United Nations Population Fund and Nepal Red Cross Society to distribute warm clothes to 12 new mothers in the Nakkhu area of Lalitpur, who are taking refuge in makeshift shelters.”Maternal health experts say expecting mothers may face difficulties in attending regular checkups during pregnancy, which could put both their lives and babies at risk. Along with a potential drop in institutional deliveries, the number of antenatal and postnatal visits could also decline due to the impact of the disaster, according to them.With the government announcing free institutional delivery service in 2009 at all state-run health facilities, more than 2,800 birthing centres were set up across the country. The institutional delivery rate, which was around 18 percent then, has now increased to an average of around 80 percent across the country. The health ministry also provides travel allowances for antenatal care visits, offers skilled birth attendant (SBA) training to staff nurses, and hires them at birthing centres to help prevent deaths during or after childbirth.Nepal had cut the maternal mortality rate from 539 per 100,000 births in 1996 to 239 per 100,000 births in 2016—for which the country even received a Millennium Development Goals award.In the last fiscal year, at least 190 women from 51 districts died of complications during childbirth, data provided by the health ministry shows.The actual number of maternal deaths due to birth-related complications could be much higher, as maternal and perinatal death surveillance is being carried out in 51 districts only, officials say.Nepal’s target under the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals is to reduce the maternal mortality rate to 75 per 100,000 births by 2030. \nForeign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba on Wednesday called for stronger cooperation among Asia Cooperation Dialogue (ACD) member states to harness artificial intelligence’s (AI) potential for shared prosperity.Speaking at the ACD Business Forum in Doha, Qatar, Minister Rana highlighted AI’s role in shaping global financial architecture, governance, and key sectors like education, health, and security. She stressed the need to address data security, disinformation, and the digital divide.According to the Nepali Embassy in Doha, Minister Rana also urged foreign investors to explore opportunities in Nepal across diverse sectors, including energy, tourism, manufacturing, agriculture, infrastructure development, education, health, and AI.She highlighted Nepal’s conducive business environment and invited business delegations from ACD member states to capitalise on these investment prospects.The forum, held under the theme “Artificial Intelligence and New Business Models,” was attended by the Qatari Minister of Trade and Industry Mohammed bin Hamad bin Qassim Al Thani, deputy prime ministers, ministers from ACD member states, and representatives from the private sector.Rana, who is leading a Nepali delegation that includes Foreign Secretary Sewa Lamsal and other officials, is set to address the Third ACD Summit on Thursday. She also visited the Nepali Embassy in Doha to review its activities and instructed officials to ensure effective consular services for Nepali expatriates.The delegation arrived in Doha on Tuesday afternoon. \nNepal, India, and Bangladesh have signed a trilateral agreement to trade 40 megawatts of electricity. The historic deal, signed in Kathmandu on Thursday, allows Nepal to sell electricity to a third country for the first time. So far, Nepal’s energy trade has been taking place only with the southern neighbour India. The agreement was signed by Kulman Ghising, executive director of the Nepal Electricity Authority, Renu Narang, CEO of India's NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam, and Mohammad Rezaul Karim, chairman of Bangladesh Power Development Board amid a function in Kathmandu. Energy Minister Deepak Khadka, Minister of State for Energy Purna Bahadur Tamang, and Bangladeshi Minister for Forest, Environment, Climate Change, and Water Resources Syeda Rizwana Hasan witnessed the signing of the deal.As per the agreement, Bangladesh will now import 40 megawatts of electricity from Nepal. The Indian side has also been involved in the trade deal as Nepal’s electricity will be transmitted to Bangladesh through the transmission infrastructure on the Indian territory. Nepal and Bangladesh are not territorially linked to each other.Nepal is estimated to sell 144,000 MWh (megawatt-hour) of electricity in five months—mid-June to mid-November—at the rate of 6.4 US cents a unit.Originally scheduled for July 28, the signing was postponed due to political tension and a change of government in Bangladesh.For now, Nepal will transmit the energy to India through the 400KV Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur cross-border transmission line and before India transmits the equivalent to Bangladesh. The NEA will calculate the quantum of exported energy at the Mazaffarpur point. The NEA estimates an earning of around Rs330 million for the country through the sale. \nThe tussles between the bench and the bar, two complementary branches of the judiciary in normal course, are becoming far too common in Nepal. The conflict between the two sides is a worrying sign for the overall health of the country’s legal system. Take the recent appointment of two Supreme Court justices as the most recent case in point. The Judicial Council on September 27 nominated two high court chief judges as Supreme Court justices even as lawyers were protesting against the possible nominations. The dispute took a nasty turn after the Supreme Court administration on Tuesday filed a contempt of court case against Nepal Bar Association President Gopal Krishna Ghimire for criticising the justice selection process. He had accused the council of picking the two justices based on a monetary deal.With the filing of the contempt case, the confrontation has entered a new stage, for the original dispute was limited to the judges’ hierarchy. The bar demanded the correction of a provision, which was included in a recently amended regulation, that “unfairly demoted judges” appointed from among lawyers, placing them below career judges in the hierarchy. It was an issue that could (and should) have been amicably resolved through negotiations between the two sides. Both sides are at fault. The protest of the Bar President Ghimire could have been more effective had he clearly spelled out how exactly money changed hands during the judge-appointment process (if he had such evidence in the first place). What we see of late is leaders of our vital institutions giving provocative statements to further complicate things instead of speaking based on facts and with an intent of giving solutions to existing problems.The top court justices in turn took serious exception to Ghimire’s remarks. But those in the leadership should also not forget that the judiciary is not free from anomalies. Several study panels including those led by Shrihari Aryal, Ram Prasad Shrestha, Girish Chandra Lal and Harikrishna Karki all have pointed out the malpractices that are rampant in courts. The report of the panel led by Karki, who later became chief justice, was widely discussed as it categorically described anomalies including the unwanted influence of middlemen in the court and underscored the need to urgently address the problem. Accordingly, while presenting his action plan, during his parliamentary hearing on Wednesday, proposed chief justice Prakash Man Singh Raut pledged to reform laws to remove the problem of middlemen in courts.It was only two years ago that both the bar and judges were on a warpath against the then chief justice Cholendra Shamsher Rana. Justices as well as lawyers had boycotted hearings demanding Rana’s resignation. Hence, the judiciary that is entrusted with a big responsibility of arbitrating disputes of other individuals and institutions has itself come into dispute. Thousands of cases are pending in courts. Common folks have to wait for years for justice. There is no way Nepal’s justice delivery system can be improved without the bar and the bench closely working together. Instead, their acrimonious public debate threatens not only to delay the system even more. It will also further erode the public’s faith in the judiciary.  \nBack in 1983, India was trundling along, as it had since independence, at its ‘Hindu rate of growth’. I was in Calcutta, enrolled in a college, but generally being educated in other ways. One such edifying instance was when a friend and I walked into what looked like a nice-looking store on a side road off the famous Park Street. As we entered, there was a flurry of movement among the store clerks arrayed behind the long U-shaped counter that went around the room, and we were taken aback at the sight of all those ‘uncles’ standing up ready to serve us teenagers. My friend was hoping to buy a shirt for his father but upon hearing the prices we made a dignified but hasty exit; a single shirt would have cost nearly as much as our entire monthly allowance.That such high-end shops even existed was a testament to the purchasing power of a small group of wealthy Indians who have always been around. According to a recent research paper, in the early 1980s, the top 10 percent owned 45 percent of India’s national wealth. Given the population of India, that would have been a number large enough to keep the luxury goods market humming.Following the liberalisation of the early 1990s, the Indian economy took off, with its GDP galloping 13-fold since 1991. Ours also grew by 10 times, but because the Indian economy is 90 times larger, the actual volume of increase there is staggering. Over the decades, there have been visible changes in how people live, dress and spend and also in infrastructural growth everywhere. The Indian middle class is now 400–600 million strong, depending on how one defines it. And, as The Economist put it, with enough spending clout that ‘[a]round the world tourism boards, hotels and restaurateurs are starting to compete for Indian travellers’. All stuff of dreams for a country like ours, characterised by perennial misgovernance and mismanagement.Other side of the story Sadly, that is only part of the equation since India’s rise has masked extreme inequalities. The concentration of wealth at the top has worsened, with the top 10, 1 and 0.1 percent, respectively, owning 65, 40, 29 percent of the national wealth. Conversely, in 1991, the bottom 50 percent and the middle 40 percent possessed 9 and 41 percent of the country’s wealth. By 2023, their share had gone down to 7 and 29 percent; the richest 1 percent of Indians owned more than the combined total of 90 percent of their compatriots at the bottom.So, what does that mean for people at the margins? Part of the answer is to be found in a remarkable book I chanced upon, Unequal: Why India Lags Behind Its Neighbours, by Swati Narayan of the OP Jindal Global University. Published in late 2023, the author compares India with Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka. Since I could not find any discussion of the book in our media, this piece provides a few insights from it, albeit limited mainly to Nepal.Although she uses national figures, when taking specific examples from North India, Narayan compares the state of Bihar with Bangladesh and Nepal given the similarity in average incomes in all three. She looks at various indicators to forcefully lay out the case that despite its impressive growth, India has slowly become the regional laggard.Narayan found that students in Bihar’s government schools invariably sat on the floor compared to the 85 percent of students in Nepal and 66 percent in Bangladesh who were at desks. As someone coming after fieldwork in Bihar, she was quick to note that in her study village in the hills of Sindhuli, ‘the seating arrangements did not reflect any bias based on caste or religion’.Infant mortality in India was 33 per 1000 live births compared to 29 in Bangladesh and Nepal, with the latter ‘amongst the fastest countries of the developing world to reduce child deaths—even in the thick of a guerrilla war’. In terms of malnutrition among children up to the age of six, 22 and 27 percent, respectively, in Bangladesh and Nepal were to be ‘too thin for their age’, a figure that was 32 percent in India. In the provision of health services, major differences were evident. Her survey found that far more health facilities in Nepal and Bangladesh had stocked at least half of the 13 basic medicines. No wonder people from Uttar Pradesh ‘routinely cross the border to go to Nepal, as healthcare was cheaper and better there’.When asked if people in their family had gone to bed on an empty stomach, Narayan found women in Bangladesh and Nepal to be ‘truly puzzled by this question’ and that over 90 percent of her respondents were quite certain no one had. That was not the case in Bihar where the ‘downcast eyes [of the women] and silences spoke volumes of their own haunting deprivation’.Unmistakable improvements Narayan’s book is a treasure trove of such figures. But I also found some of her narrative descriptions more revealing. I present one such longish vignette that struck me.‘Her sleeveless dress and quiet confidence were a breath of fresh air in the dusty, ramshackle home. Most of the other women in this family, from the Dom caste, were dressed in crumpled saris. Renu’s husband, Jitu, too, in his smart shorts, looked completely out of place in this remote Bihari village. After we struck up a conversation, I realized that the young couple had just crossed the open border, less than a kilometre away, from Nepal to Bihar on a day trip to visit their family…The contrasts between these relatives who lived on different sides of the international border could not have been starker. In Kathmandu, Renu worked in a private canteen, while Jitu was a mechanic. The young couple were upwardly mobile and in good health and spirits. As a Nepali, Renu’s education in government schools had been free until grade eight. Every time her nine-month-old infant fell ill, she confidently took her to a nearby government health post for free treatment. The brimming self-assurance of this bright, young Dalit couple was not an exception. Since the return of democracy in 2006, as my research even a decade later showed, Nepal has witnessed an unmistakeable improvement in caste and gender equations…Their Indian relatives, on the other hand, were struggling to eke out a living. Renu’s sister-in-law Malati, who was born in Nepal and had shifted to India two decades ago after marriage, complained about the caste discrimination that her children faced in school. She also confided that she was petrified of her family falling ill. In this Bihari hinterland, there were no health centres nearby, nor were free medicines available.’Narayan asks why Nepali women seem to be more empowered than their sisters in Bangladesh and Bihar, and why the governments of Bangladesh and Nepal have focused more on education and health. She believes that is because the emphasis has been on reducing inequalities arising from differences in wealth, caste and gender, a feat India seems to have lost sight of in its push for unbridled growth.A comparative study of this kind certainly would not be able to capture the many nuances within a country as complex as Nepal. Narayan conducted her research in 2016, but we can only presume that we are still on the same right track despite all the governments that have come and gone since. As we usher in the festive season of Dashain, Tihar and Chhath, that would be something to cheer about. \nOne might say that nothing will happen and that the world will continue just as it has so far. However, after last week and the endless volley of attacks, bombings and assassinations we witnessed, it certainly feels like something is imminent.True to their métier, the world’s astrologers portend events based on an annular solar eclipse set to take place today. Solar eclipses—or so they say—represent the death of a ‘solar’ figure: Perhaps a monarch or a leader who dies, is deposed, or loses power in some other way. Adding to all the malevolent possibilities, astrologers say that the reappearance of several ‘stars’, whose earlier presence had brought discord, does not augur well and that these stars feature prominently in the astrological chart of the United States.Astrology must always be taken with a grain of salt: after all, there are soothsayers on both sides of the fence, and the way an event—any event under discussion—plays out will prove one side more ‘accurate’ than the other.However, prophecies and auguries are not needed. It does not take much looking around to note that the world, always tumultuous, is undergoing exceptional mayhem. It is not only the events that have dominated the Middle East which portend terrible outcomes. Undoubtedly, the ongoing war in the Middle East, the barbarous Israeli bombings of Gaza, and now Beirut and southern Lebanon, are significant factors in the assessment of the dire international situation. But on a wider scale, too, everything points to escalations, one-upmanship, covert actions, and undisclosed secret actors.Even if we choose to ignore the specifics of these conflicts and carefully insulate ourselves so that we are not exposed to the news and its macabre content, the general malaise is contagious. Anxiety is heightened because in witnessing the helplessness of others one dwells even more on one’s own set of circumstances.Repeatedly watching people suffer—thanks to the age of social media—is a particular predicament of our age. Experts have already found that it increases levels of latent anxiety in people. So does confronting problems that one is not able to address. And in our world, we seem to be surrounded by challenges that do not appear to have a solution.Wars undoubtedly belong to this latter category. This weekend, as Beirut was pummelled by the Israeli Defence Forces, it was dispiriting to watch members of the UN Security Council (UNSC) talk past one another while people were being killed in real time. As a recent report issued by the charity Oxfam notes, this multilateral body, which was created with the specific intent of preventing catastrophe, has failed miserably in its mandate.The report, Vetoing Humanity, says in its summary: “A handful of powerful nations who represent only 25 per cent of the world population but hold its nuclear button, have too often manipulated the global peace and security system to meet their geopolitical and economic interests. Between 2014 and 2024, one or more of the five permanent UNSC member states … vetoed 30 UNSC resolutions on protracted crises, including resolutions on the Occupied Palestinian Territory … and Israel, Ukraine, Syria and Yemen.”The Middle East war may dominate the headlines, but other major conflicts may be waiting in the wings. Over in the South China Sea, a situation is escalating. For several years, China has been constructing and lately fortifying islands that are decreasing the physical distance between itself and the Philippines. In the past two weeks, China and the Philippines’ coastguard have had skirmishes. The fight is over an area of the South China Sea called the Sabina Shoals, which the Philippines wishes to control because it is key to its trade routes with the rest of the world. Given that China has also had testy exchanges with Taiwan, the area seems poised to become a major flashpoint for a wider conflict.Then there is Europe. American newspapers in the past two weeks have been full of ominous editorials warning that Ukrainian soldiers are about to bleed out of the conflict because of the lack of support from the US. Others point out that the issue is not only the Russia and Ukraine theatre but also Russia’s assistance to Iran, which could cross the nuclear finish line, causing a huge shift in the power balance in the region.It is a good time to keep a diary or a journal. Accounts of such documents kept by people during World War II show a variety of perspectives of the same sets of events. In fact, much before the war broke out, even before the rise of Hitler, some people had recognised the pockets of hostility that would propel tensions towards a massive conflict.Others felt safe until the Gestapo came knocking at their door and dragged them out of their comfortable homes in Berlin or Vienna or Krakow or Paris to be transported to the deathly gas chambers. All of them have perished but their accounts remain to tell us who was right and who had no idea of what was going happen.So, too, will it be with us. Whoever is ultimately right about the future — the ones that prophesy peace or those who warn of war — will be dead by the time the ultimate outcome is known. In this sense, the accounts of the past provide an odd source of solace: Whatever ills may be peculiar to this age of internet, wars have wreaked havoc on human lives for far longer.Then again, perhaps those are the rationalising words of someone who is not directly facing the rain of bullets or barrage of bombs, which are taking lives thousands of kilometres away from their vantage point.-Dawn (Pakistan)/ANN \nThe record-breaking recent rains, which have so far claimed 217 lives and left dozens missing nationwide, have badly disrupted major highways out of Kathmandu just days ahead of the Dashain holidays. At different points on several of these routes, the Nepal Army, the Armed Police Force, the Nepal Police, other agencies and local people are relentlessly working to clear the debris. But by and large authorities do not appear serious about ensuring safe and accessible travel during the Dashain travel rush. Every year, during Dashain and Tihar, a big mass of people leave Kathmandu to travel to their home districts. Last year, around 1.5 million people did, according to the Nepal Transport Entrepreneurs Association. The Dashain travel is an ordeal for Nepalis every year due to the bad road conditions, traffic jams and the competition to buy tickets on time at a reasonable price. However, road disruptions this time have already made the people wary of travelling. Among the routes linking Kathmandu with various parts of Nepal, Prithivi Highway is currently the only functioning one. According to the Department of Roads, BP Highway linking eastern Nepal with Kathmandu Valley is obstructed at Nepalthok, Kavre. Similarly, Kanti Rajpath, the alternative highway connecting Kathmandu to the Tarai regions and the Araniko Highway, have also been disrupted at various places. Moreover, other roads in the hilly regions are not fit for operation. Even in the case of Prithivi Highway, the route is still risky as only one-way traffic has been open along the Jhyaple Khola and Jawang Khola sections. Although more routes might be accessible in the coming days as the Department plans diversion roads for Dashain travel, this would only mean longer travel times and more risks as rainfall in the coming days could disturb the fragile roads.Roads are the major means of travel for Nepalis, especially during the festivals when air ticket prices soar and become unaffordable for many. On Saturday, after the disaster struck several parts of Nepal, there was a hike in air ticket prices. People fretted online about how the Kathmandu-New Delhi flight was cheaper than the Kathmandu-Dhangadhi flight. Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli appealed to the domestic airlines to maintain regular ticket prices or offer discounts. The airline companies did agree to reduce the price for three days following public outcry. On Tuesday, the companies further agreed to continue this until the roadways become operational again. Whatever the airline companies do or don’t do, the government cannot overlook the conditions of the country’s major highways as far too many Nepalis simply have no financial means to fly. Dashain places a heavy financial burden on the average Nepali, especially with the rising prices of goods. The floods and landslides are already translating into hikes in the price of day-to-day necessities. Given the sorry condition of the highways, people are deciding not to travel to their home districts. Moreover, the Federation of Nepali National Transport Entrepreneurs closed advance bus ticket booking for Dashain on Tuesday. This seems reasonable. However, the authorities must be vigilant about transporters using this tactic to cram in passengers at the last moment. The government must mobilise all its resources to repair the damaged highways. Nepalis of late have not had much to celebrate. Continuous political instability, rising prices and natural disasters have been frequent downers. The least the government can do now is to repair the highways on a war footing and ensure that people of all economic backgrounds get to celebrate the festivals with their loved ones. \nNepal on Thursday signed a business-to-business framework agreement with India in New Delhi to build several petroleum projects. This comes amid environmentalists' call for an end to new investments in fossil fuel pipelines as Nepal has all the feasible cleaner alternatives.The development comes a week after Nepal’s Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli addressed the 79th session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, calling for climate justice. He told the assembly about Nepal’s plan to achieve a net-zero emission target by 2045, five years ahead of the global target.Environmentalists say Nepal’s policy has reversed the blueprint for the country’s second Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC), which outlines its ambitious targets for the next decade to reduce emissions and support vulnerable communities in adapting to the impacts of climate change.The NDC outlines Nepal’s mitigation efforts, which include a commitment to promote renewable energy and electric mobility and manage forests.Under the business-to-business agreement, the Indian government will build a 50-km cross-border pipeline from Siliguri, India, to Charali, Jhapa. In Charali, a smart green field terminal with the capacity for 18,900 kilometres will be built. Both projects are being built with an Indian grant.According to a statement issued by Nepal Oil Corporation, Chandika Prasad Bhatta, managing director of Nepal Oil Corporation, and Senthil Kumar, director of Indian Oil Corporation, signed the agreement in New Delhi in the presence of Pankaj Jain, secretary of the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, and Satish Kumar, chairman of Indian Oil.The statement reads that the Indian government has also agreed to build a 62 km long petroleum pipeline from Amalekhgunj to Lothar, Chitwan in Nepal, on grant. “Agreement was also done to build a 91,900-kilolitre capacity smart green field terminal with an investment from Nepal Oil Corporation in the technical support of India.”India will provide a grant of Rs15 billion for the three petroleum projects built in Nepal. Under the business-to-business agreement, a business contract between two parties, Nepal’s position on the length of the supply agreement is unclear.“During the government-to-government agreement, it was agreed that all four projects would be completed within 54 months,” said Manoj Thakur, deputy director of Nepal Oil Corporation. “The work will start soon.”“Once we hand over the land to Indian Oil Corporation, the Indian side will design the project,” he said.The project design is expected to take 3-6 months to complete. The land purchase in Jhapa and Chitwan has been already concluded, said Thakur. An energy expert said that Nepal’s private sector is aggressively investing in the hydro sector, and the government’s investment in petroleum infrastructure could be a setback for them and the country.Nepal needs to substitute fossil fuels with green energy to reduce the ever-growing trade deficit, Bhushan Tuladhar, an environmental expert, told the Post in a recent interview. “Instead of investing in fuel pipelines, the government should invest in renewable hydropower, cross-border energy trade and installation of charging stations for EVs.”In the UNGA, the prime minister said that Nepal is hard hit by climate change and is one of the most vulnerable nations to it, ranking it the 20th most disaster-prone country in the world.“Nepal has been contributing to the health of our planets through its forest, mountains and rivers. Despite the efforts, we continue to bear the brunt of climate change. In this context, we call for climate justice,” said the prime minister.In 2021, the International Energy Agency called for an immediate end to new investments in fossil fuel supply projects such as pipelines.It urged the rapid adoption of renewable energy, such as solar and wind power and a large-scale research and development programme to develop future technologies, including advanced batteries, producing energy from hydrogen, and removing CO2 from the atmosphere.The report, entitled Net Zero by 2050: A Roadmap for the Global Energy Sector, says that with global greenhouse gas emissions continuing to rise, current pledges to cut CO2 “would fall well short” of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 and holding global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit).The International Energy Agency says the world has a “viable” yet “narrow” path to avoiding disruptive climate change and must embrace “an unprecedented transformation of how energy is produced, transported and used globally”.The agency also calls for quadrupling solar and wind power capacity in the next decade and a global push to adopt energy efficiency improvements of 4 percent annually by 2030.This rapid transition from fossil fuels must also occur as the world provides electricity to 785 million people who currently lack clean-cooking technologies and the 2.6 billion people who lack them. The International Energy Agency says that this suite of measures to wean the economy off fossil fuels will add $5 trillion in energy investments by 2030, create millions of jobs, and lead to a global gross domestic product in 2030 four percent higher than a business-as-usual approach.In Nepal, according to the Department of Customs, the import of petroleum products amounted to Rs337.34 billion in the last fiscal year, nearly 20 percent of the country’s total import bills.Petroleum products are Nepal’s top imported products and are dependent on India.Nepal's government has also introduced an ambitious hydropower roadmap to fulfill its net-zero emission commitment by 2045.In the transport sector, Nepal has launched a strategy to increase the sales of electric vehicles (EVs) to 90 percent of all private passenger vehicles, including two-wheelers, sold and 60 percent of all four-wheeler public passenger vehicle sales by 2030.Massive tax waivers have been given on EV imports to promote electricity and reduce fossil fuel imports.The government has also set a goal of installing 500,000 improved cooking stoves, primarily in rural areas, and an additional 200,000 household biogas plants and 500 large-scale biogas plants.Nepal’s strategy is to have electric stoves as the primary mode of cooking in 25 percent of households by 2030. To meet this target, Nepal would need to invest $25 billion.Nepali politicians have been making many promises to switch to clean energy. Still, according to experts, the other hand is building a spree of petroleum projects, a mockery to the translation for clean energy. \nIndia’s Supreme Court asked authorities on Thursday to report back within a week on what they were doing to stop farmers from burning crop residue as smog began to pollute the air in the capital Delhi and surrounding regions, local media reported.Farmers in the northern states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh burn crop stubble after rice is harvested around October to clear the fields before planting wheat crops.The smoke contributes to a toxic smog that engulfs Delhi, frequently making it the world’s most polluted capital ahead of winter as calm winds and lower temperatures trap pollutants in the air.Federal and state authorities have encouraged farmers to stop burning crop residue and penalised those that do but have not been able to fully curb the practice due to the large area involved and the hostility of farmers in some places.“In some of the districts in Punjab and Haryana the incidents of stubble burning increased substantially as compared to 2023,” legal news website Live Law reported the court as saying. “However, all (that) the states have done is to recover nominal compensation from 42 and 45 farmers respectively.”A government website monitoring crop burning showed about 200 fires almost every day in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh since the middle of September.The court also pulled up the Commission for Air Quality Management, a government body responsible for air quality in the national capital region, saying it “does not seem to be making any efforts to follow up implementation of its own directions”.The court asked the commission, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and state authorities to report within one week on the action being taken to stop crop residue burning.India was rated the third most polluted country last year by Swiss group IQAir, behind Bangladesh and Pakistan. New Delhi ranked sixth on a real-time list of the world’s most polluted cities with the air quality index at 115 on Thursday, a level considered unhealthy for sensitive groups.India’s weather office has forecast moderate air quality in the capital until Oct. 6 and then moderate-to-poor for six days after that.Experts fear air quality could further deteriorate from mid-October when farm fires are expected to increase before peaking towards the end of the month and beginning of November. \nSix migrants died after Mexican soldiers fired on a group of 33 migrants traveling in a pick-up truck that had tried to evade a military patrol, the defense ministry said on Wednesday, underlining tensions on Mexico’s southern border as it faces US pressure to contain migration.Another 10 migrants were injured in the incident on Tuesday evening, the ministry said in a statement. The group included people of Egyptian, Nepalese, Cuban, Indian and Pakistani nationality, though the statement did not specify the nationalities of the deceased.The ministry said the incident took place just before 9 p.m. local time on Tuesday while the patrol traveled on a highway near the town of Huixtla, some 40 km (25 miles) from Tapachula, by the Guatemalan border.The pick-up truck was followed by two vehicles similar to those used by criminal groups in the area, it said, and soldiers reported hearing explosions after which two officers opened fire.Four migrants were killed at the scene while two others died later in hospital.The deaths shine a renewed spotlight on Mexico’s policy towards migrants as well as the growing role of the military in the country’s security.“These events are neither accidental nor isolated, they are a consequence of the restrictive immigration policies that the Mexican state continues to implement,” the Collective for the Monitoring of the Southern Border, a grouping of advocacy and civil society organizations, said in a statement.Mexico has been under pressure by the United States to reduce the number of migrants arriving at their shared border, where record numbers of people have tried to cross in recent years, fleeing economic hardship and violence.In recent months illegal border crossings have fallen, as the Biden administration has toughened its approach to border security in the run-up to the November 5 elections, where Vice President Kamala Harris faces Republican Donald Trump, who has vowed a wide-ranging crackdown if reelected.Tapachula, in southern Chiapas state, is an entry point into Mexico for many migrants making the arduous journey towards the United States. Chiapas has also seen clashes this year between the Jalisco New Generation Cartel and Sinaloa Cartel. In July, the turf wars sent some 600 people fleeing across the border into Guatemala.Mexico's defense ministry said the two soldiers who fired on the migrants were removed from their posts and federal prosecutors had been informed. A military tribunal will also carry out its own investigation.It said it reaffirmed “its commitment to act in strict accordance with the rule of law, under a policy of zero-impunity, and is ready to help the civil authorities to shed light on the facts.”The ministry added it was coordinating with Mexico’s foreign ministry to contact corresponding embassies. \nNepal and Bangladesh discuss strengthening bilateral relations, particularly in energy cooperation, with Bangladesh importing 40 MW of electricity from Nepal.\nSingapore's former trade and transport minister, S. Iswaran, received a 12-month prison sentence for obstructing justice and accepting $300,000 in gifts, marking the first time an ex-cabinet member has been jailed in Singapore's history.\nKite flying in Kathmandu Valley was a vibrant tradition dating back to the Malla era, with a peak in popularity during Dashain, featuring fighters competing to cut each other's lines and spectators enjoying the spectacle.\nMonsoon devastation in Nepal has heightened the risk of disease outbreaks, with experts warning of a potential surge in water-borne, vector-borne, and air-borne infections due to contaminated water sources and displaced living conditions.\nAs the festive season approaches, prices of daily essentials like rice, edible oil, legumes, and lentils have increased.Retailers say food prices are expected to stay high throughout Dashain and Tihar, Nepal’s biggest festivals.In Nepal, food prices are heavily influenced by the Indian market. Even though prices have not increased in India, some opportunist traders have been taking advantage of the poor market monitoring to increase prices under different pretexts. For example, on September 14, India raised the basic import tax on crude and refined edible oils by 20 percent. Nepali importers seized this opportunity to hike their prices even though Nepal had not raised the import tax.Dhurba Prasad Adhikari, joint treasurer of the Nepal Retailers Association, said Nepali wholesalers and retailers have already raised the prices. “It has been a week since edible oil price was increased by Rs20 per litre and the price is expected to increase further as the festive demand kicks in,” he said. But he admits that market rumours and weak inspections make prices more unstable, especially during the festive season when demand is at its peak.According to the association, sunflower oil prices have increased from Rs190 to Rs210 per litre. Likewise, the per litre price of mustard oil has gone up from Rs350 to Rs370.Adhikari, who operates Adhikari Khadya Store, said the price of edible oil is expected to increase in Tihar due to high demand.Retailers said strict inspections in large trading houses could help stabilise prices during the festive season. Consumer rights activists say the current government inspections of the market are just for show and will not address issues related to price, quality, and quantity.“The government’s market inspection body is looking only at retail markets. They, too, know this will not change prices unless they also inspect the warehouses of large importers and traders,” Adhikari said. He said that the government inspecting body needs to check on the stock of goods held by traders.According to retailers, even with the new rice harvesting beginning soon, prices of the staple have increased by Rs100 kg for a 25 kg bag.Even the price of sona mansuli, which normally remains at Rs60 per kg, has now inched up to Rs70 to Rs75 per kg.Rice prices, however, are expected to decline after the arrival of the new harvest.Sugar is now being sold at Rs120 per kg and expected to rise further, retailers said.As private sector traders say they are out of sugar stock and both state supply utilities—the Salt Trading Corporation and the Food Management and Trading Company—have delayed opening the tender to import the sweetener, according to market insiders, the price is expected to cross Rs160 per kg by Tihar.However, retailers said the jeera (cumin seed) price has declined. But the price could still go up in the next two weeks.Last year during Dashain, the price of jeera, an indispensable spice, spiked from Rs1,400 to Rs1,500 per kg. The price has declined, and it is being transacted around Rs950 per kg this year, Adhikari said. Prices of lentils and legumes tend to fluctuate based on international production, but have remained high in recent months.According to the association, pulses have reached Rs180 per kg from Rs175 per kg.Adhikari said food prices have been increasing every year. “The rice prices are so high that people are buying only what they need in smaller quantities,” said Adhikari.“The government needs to intervene in the market, particularly inspect the large traders engaged in unscrupulous market activities,” said Prem Lal Maharjan, president of the National Consumer Forum. “Proper inspection will help bring the prices down. It will also help the government bring in more revenues,” he said.As the government has started operating fair-price shops across the country, there might be some relief for consumers, Maharjan said. “But such subsidised shops should be operated year-round to control market prices.”    \nUS Ambassador Dean Richard Thompson reflects on his Nepal tenure, highlighting key events and developments: Nepal's democratic elections, bilateral relations, US assistance projects including MCC, geopolitical competition with China, US-Nepal military cooperation, the Indo-Pacific Strategy, transitional justice progress, the need for American FDI, and trade talks.\nHere’s what Prime Minister KP Oli told the parliament on Monday, saying he was giving the address for a “special” reason: “Nepal wants to maintain neighbourly relations as a good neighbour, not a petty, scheming neighbour…Nepal wants a similar behaviour on the part of its neighbours.”He pursued this line of argument, implying that India is wishing ill on Nepal, imposing on Nepal’s sovereignty and interfering in its independent status and policy. He then told the parliament that he would present the issue at the United Nations General Assembly.It basically amounts to saying he will complain to the UN about India’s behaviour. What a petty idea.Given his inherent character trait, PM Oli will find it difficult to develop trusted relations with India in the short term. His only option is to be diplomatic, predictable and consistent. So far, he’s not been able to do that. It does not bode well for Nepal’s foreign policy, which is the most important means of pursuing Nepal’s current priorities, including jobs, growth and climate change.Calculated relations Oli’s statement in the parliament indicates at least three things. First, his expectations from India have not been fulfilled. Second, his communications with the country have broken down. And third, he thinks India may be working to undermine his political authority.Let’s look at his expectations from the southern neighbour. Oli wants to hold high-level talks with PM Modi of India and build trusted relations.In the past two weeks, media reports and opinion pieces have discussed whether Oli would be invited to India or not. It has almost become customary in Nepal for a new prime minister to visit India first before embarking on other high-level visits. Such a custom indicates the value politicians accord to India, especially if they want their government to be stable.The second indication is that Oli is finding it difficult to communicate with people who matter in India. When you begin to communicate your feelings about India through the media, it indicates that your direct communications have either broken down or are ineffective.Behind Oli’s statement is an obvious intention to play the blame game or rally the public. India may be at fault for many things, but blaming India does not absolve him of inconsistencies on his part or the sheer inability to conduct diplomacy in a dignified manner.The third indication is even more significant. Oli has consistently promoted anti-Indian nationalism, and India finds it difficult to trust him. But would that alone be enough to undermine his government?Throughout history, India has had a significant influence on Nepal’s political process and decision-making. Through its influence on individuals who’ve received gifts, benefits, and resources, some at the highest levels, India holds significant leverage over political decision-making and, by extension, over policies and processes.An old playbookIndia’s calculated relations with the Nepali state came to the fore in August this year when Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba visited India. New Delhi turned her visit into a high-profile affair even though she was unprepared to represent Nepal’s interests. Her visit, rather than building political trust, ended up creating more mistrust between Oli and New Delhi as well as between the Foreign Ministry and the Prime Minister’s Office.Although it is a matter of speculation, there are strong grounds to argue that such a courtesy would not have been extended to someone from the CPN (UML). It generates the question, at least in the public’s mind, whether India accorded special treatment to FM Rana as a “special” individual who happened to be the foreign minister and not as a representative of Nepal.Whether real or not, the perception that India is unhappy with Oli has fuelled the notion that the current government coalition is unstable.Throughout Nepal’s modern history, whenever top leaders are forced out, they tend to seek India’s support to regain power. I have heard firsthand from top political leaders that India used to put a pre-condition: First, demonstrate that you have people's support, then we will use our leverage to help you. Thus, the political leaders would launch a political campaign and hold mass meetings throughout the country. If the broader political environment favoured a political change, then India made the additional push.Now, as Pushpa Kamal Dahal tours the country, blaming a corrupt network of power brokers, we are reminded of this old playbook. During mass meetings, an embittered Dahal frequently alleges that “middlemen, brokers, and big cronies have gotten together, and with the strength of so-called numbers, have tried to strangle truth, justice…and good governance.” He also tells the public that his government was ousted because the investigations on corruption were leading to Budhanilkantha (Deuba’s residence) and Balkot (Oli’s residence).Oli’s inherent anti-Indian streakFor Oli, an inherent anti-Indian streak in his psychological make-up and an affinity with the Communist Party of China makes rapprochement with India difficult.In the last 10 years, Oli has made countless petty statements intended to rile and irritate India. He has also accorded China greater space in Nepal.In his book, former deputy PM Kamal Thapa expresses distaste at the way Oli made an unscheduled visit to China Gezhouba Group Corporation and disappeared for one and a half hours for a private meeting with Chinese Communist Party officials during his visit to China in 2016.Another issue is the Eminent Persons’ Group report, which Oli raised during the launch of Thapa’s book. “It would be good to receive the report,” he said during the programme. He made more anti-Indian remarks at another similar event.At present, any talk of the EPG report is viewed as an irritant by India, because it has consistently sent a clear diplomatic message that the report is dead. The unwillingness of a section of the Nepali populace to accept the message, including the CPN-UML, has not gone well in India.In a recent discussion programme, a former ambassador of India to Nepal indicated that the EPG report had become a new irritant in Nepal-India relations. He said that instead of insisting on the acceptance of the report, Nepal could pursue the individual issues identified. Trends in the last two decades indicate that instead of really trying to address the outstanding issues in Nepal-India relations, Nepali leaders are just interested in politicising them and gaining personal mileage.Nepal’s relationship with India has become more and more of a paradox. Nepal’s dominant ethno-nationalism is anti-Indian. Indeed, Nepal has many unresolved issues with India, but it’s economic development hinges on closer connectivity with India, which in turn hinges on trusted political relationships and ability to untangle complex issues.Snubbed by India, Oli is now headed to the US, where he could still get to meet a lukewarm Modi. He hopes to gain stature and make an impression at several forums including the UNGA, where he is scheduled to deliver speeches. We can only wish our PM well. \nFive years ago, on September 30, 2019, when KP Sharma Oli was prime minister for the second time, the government declared the entire country open-defecation free amid much fanfare. However, years later, thousands of people from across the country are getting infected with diarrheal diseases, including scores from cholera.Rautahat is among the nine districts reporting cholera outbreaks this year. Ward 4 of Rajpur Municipality has reported over 100 cases of diarrheal infection and hospitalisation. However, the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division said only 12 people from the municipality had so far contracted cholera.“Over 100 diarrheal patients from the municipality’s ward 4 have been hospitalised,” Khusid Ahmad, a health worker at the municipality, told the Post over the phone from Rautahat. “Contaminated drinking water could be the culprit for the cholera outbreak there. Samples of drinking water collected from affected areas have been sent for lab tests.”Apart from Rautahat, eight other districts—Lalitpur, Kathmandu, Kailali, Pyuthan, Makawanpur, Rolpa, Sindhupalchok, and Achham—have also reported cholera outbreaks this year. So far, the number of diarrheal patients who have contracted cholera is 95. Interestingly, most of the districts that have witnessed outbreaks of deadly cholera this year had years ago been declared open defecation-free.The Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool samples of the infected patients. Doctors say that detected cases of cholera infection could be just the tip of the iceberg, as most positive cases are being reported from the districts with active surveillance.Public health experts say outbreaks of cholera in multiple districts, even five years after the country was declared open defecation-free, show a huge gap between official declarations and progress on the ground.They say outbreaks of diarrheal diseases, including cholera, are directly linked to drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene conditions, and the country was declared open defecation-free without improving water and sanitation conditions.“Without ensuring the quality of drinking water and sanitation, among other things, authorities rushed to declare the entire country free from open defecation,” said Dr Mingmar Gyelgen Sherpa, former director general at the Department of Health Services. “Instead of improving basic water and sanitation infrastructure, we’ve focussed too much on outbreak management, and this is the wrong approach.”Even though toilets have been built in most households, open defecation is still widespread in many places. Drinking water samples collected from various parts of the country, including from the districts of the Kathmandu Valley, have been found contaminated with faecal coliform, which means the water the public uses for drinking is unsafe. The presence of faecal coliform, a microscopic organism that thrives in the intestines of warm-blooded animals or their faeces, indicates sewage contamination in the drinking water, according to doctors.A previous study had shown that 81 percent of water samples collected in the Kathmandu Valley were contaminated with deadly microbes.“We only focussed on expanding coverage of drinking water but did not pay attention to ensuring its safety,” said Dr Meghnath Dhimal, chief researcher at the Nepal Health Research Council. “Authorities concerned must also focus on improving the quality.”Experts say improving public hygiene is essential to ensuring water quality and avoiding diarrheal ailments. Awareness drives and health education play a crucial role in changing behaviours, which requires years of investment and continuous efforts.Along with investment in health education, attention should go to building climate-resilient infrastructures for drinking water and sanitation, as water resources have been contaminated by floodwaters in many districts. The effects of climate change have increased adverse events, including floods, which in turn have contaminated the source of drinking water, making people vulnerable to infection with diarrheal ailments.“Multiple agencies of the three tiers of government and non-governmental sectors have to make more effort to prevent diarrhoea outbreaks,” said Sherpa. “But there seems to be a lack of coordination among government agencies.” The World Health Organisation also stresses on a multifaceted approach as a key to controlling cholera and reducing deaths. \n\nRae was the envoy to Kathmandu during the promulgation of the 2015 constitution and the subsequent blockade. In this conversation, Rae talks about the evolution of Nepal-India ties since the blockade, regional geopolitics, what the two countries get wrong about each other, how New Delhi views Nepali communist parties and the governments they lead, and the change (if any) in India’s neighbourhood policy since the start of Narendra Modi’s third term in office. \nKunwar has been the MD for just under three years. Before coming back to her homeland to join Daraz Nepal, she worked at different American companies, including Amazon, the world’s biggest e-commerce platform. In this conversation, Kunwar talks about the opportunities and challenges of running an e-commerce enterprise in Nepal, as well as the country’s overall business environment.  \nWhen the Ranjitkar group was established, they discovered this forgotten dance and devoted two years to researching it.Now, they are reintroducing it during Indra Jatra by training the new generation in this traditional art form. \nI first met Louisa Kamal at my college, where she was invited as one of the trainers for a News Writing Workshop. Dressed simply, she captivated me with her eloquent command of language. As the minutes stretched into hours, I learned she hailed from the UK but had spent over half her life in Asia, including Thailand, Japan, and Nepal. She taught English literature for many years at government universities in Thailand and Japan.Two of her books, ‘A Rainbow of Chaos’ (2023) and ‘Rainbows in the Eyes’ (2024), further deepened my admiration for her. A graduate of Manchester University with a degree in literature, Kamal is working on her third book, ‘For Every Storm, A Rainbow’.In this conversation with the Post’s Sanskriti Pokharel, Kamal discusses her literary journey and books that comfort her during difficult times. What initially drew you to writing?Books have been in my home since childhood, and I have a special affinity for literature ever since. I used to sit on my mother’s lap, and she read children’s literature to me. She encouraged me to listen to her reading and then gradually read myself. This marked the beginning of my journey into literature. As I grew up, I couldn't imagine my life without books. Consequently, I earned my BA in English Language and Literature and an MA in Later Victorian and Edwardian Literature from the University of Manchester. It’s always been a dream of mine to be a published author, but life and the need to earn money have always gotten in the way. When I came to Nepal in 2020, and the lockdown halted my movement, it was the first time I had time on my hands. I started to write a diary to structure my life.Once I started writing, the flow became incessant. The diary eventually became my first book, ‘A Rainbow of Chaos’, followed by the second, ‘Rainbows in the Eyes’, not to mention articles on various subjects related to Nepal’s rich culture. The day is wasted if I don’t develop a few article ideas or write a few thousand words.As an author and photographer, have you ever found that capturing a scene with your lens helps articulate a written story or vice versa?Absolutely! Photography enhances my writing process. While I’m not a technical photographer, many say my photographs capture emotions and feelings. My fascination with Nepali festivals and jatras inspires me to document vibrant celebrations. The crowd during festivals give me no time to make notes, so my photos document the experience. When I revisit them, they enable me to articulate my stories. So, for me, photography and storytelling are intertwined.Can you discuss any particular literary works that inspired your two books?Colin Thubron's ‘To a Mountain in Tibet’ and Peter Matthiessen's ‘The Snow Leopard’ were two books that subconsciously influenced me when I polished my books into final forms. These books have been influential as they push the boundaries of 'travel' writing. Thubron and Matthiessen 'travel' into their souls while journeying to Kailash and Shey (Dolpa), respectively. I admire the sensitivity and richness of their language, which inspired me.My two books describe my and Nepal’s struggle to come to terms with the lockdown. Therefore, some parts of them describe cultural issues and specific locations. However, at their core, they narrate my emotional and spiritual journey as I gather the courage to start anew in Nepal. Thubron and Matthiessen helped me embrace a broader perspective, allowing me to introduce new themes in my writing. They also inspired me to think more expansively and not limit my experiences while writing. Has your reading taste evolved as you’ve lived and worked across different cultures?Definitely. Living in Manchester with my mother was limiting in some ways, as she was strict. Studying in an all-girls school made my childhood conservative as well. During that time, my interest in literature was traditional, too, and I was drawn to 19th—and 20th-century literature penned by the Bronte sisters, Thomas Hardy, Jane Austen, and others. When I moved to Japan in September 1989, I was captivated by Haikus. I also won a few competitions with the haikus I composed. As my life has taken me to different Asian countries, I have subconsciously come to value novels by Indian writers. Nowadays, I feel that the beauty of the language penned by most modern British authors has faded. But I find much taste in Indian writers, like Amitabh Gosh and Arundhati Roy. In your four-decade-long career across Asia, have any literary works helped you navigate the challenges of adapting to new cultures?When I feel homesick and stressed, I turn to the books I read as a child, such as Frances Hodgson Burnett’s ‘The Secret Garden’ and Edith Nesbit’s ‘The Railway Children.’ There have been times when I wanted to let everything go, revert to my baseline, and reconnect with my inner child. Those children’s classics have soothed my soul and soled me during those times. Louisa Kamal’s book recommendations The Secret GardenAuthor: Frances Hodgson BurnettPublisher: William HeinemannYear: 1911This book reminds me of a time before life’s complexities took over. Burnett’s writing comforts me because it connects with my inner child.To a Mountain in TibetAuthor: Colin Thubron Publisher: HarperYear: 2011Thubron’s book is a journey to Mount Kailash and into the author’s soul. The writing is moving, and it inspired me to visit Mount Kailash.On Chesil BeachAuthor: Ian McEwanPublisher: Knopf Doubleday Publishing GroupYear: 2008It's more of a novella than a novel.

Its storytelling is remarkable.Pride & PrejudiceAuthor: Jane AustenPublisher: T Egerton, WhitehallYear: 1813This work from Austen stands out as a timeless classic, and its sharp character portrayals make it a favourite of mine.Gerard Manley Hopkins The Major Works (Oxford World's Classics)Author: Gerard Manley Hopkins Publisher: OUP OxfordYear: 2009Poetry has been a part of my life since childhood, starting with AA Milne's verses. I wrote my BA dissertation on GM Hopkins. \nThe Nepali Congress is holding a ‘100-day campaign’ to rejuvenate party committees, strengthen the bond between the party's local representatives and central leaders, and pacify the party's dissenters.The party’s central committee meeting, which concluded on September 1, decided to run the 100-day campaign from September 23 to December 31. Krishna Prasad Paudel, chief secretary at the party office, says many central leaders have already reached the districts they are assigned to run campaign activities.According to Paudel, the party’s seven joint general secretaries lead the campaign in the seven provinces. Senior leaders Krishna Sitaula, Shashank Koirala, Bimalendra Nidhi, and Bijaya Kumar Gachhadar, along with some central committee leaders, have either reached the assigned districts or are on the way, Paudel said.“When the party’s senior leaders and central committee members are in their districts, vice presidents and general secretaries of the party will monitor the campaign activities,” Paudel told the Post. “If necessary, the vice presidents, the general secretaries, and the party president will go to some districts.”One of the main objectives of the campaign is to renew party membership. “We claim our party has 0.9 million members,” Paudel said. “During the campaign, leaders will check the trend of party members renewing their membership.”The campaign has been launched at a time when leaders have already started to devise their plans for the next general convention. As per the Congress statute, the party must hold its general convention every four years. The party’s 14th general convention was held in December 2021. If the statute is followed, the party’s next convention should be convened by the end of 2025.Some Congress leaders have floated the proposal of contesting the next general election on its own, without forging electoral alliance with other parties. General Secretary Gagan Thapa floated a proposal to this effect at the Mahasamiti meeting in February that forwarded the proposal to the central committee to take a decision on the issue.“If we are to fight elections on our own [without an alliance], we need a strong organisation, therefore the party is emphasising strengthening the party by conducting campaigns,” Paudel told the Post.But, for the party leaders, success of the campaign will largely depend on the way it will be run.“Will the party leaders try to connect the party organisation to the public or will they conduct it in just a traditional manner? This will determine the success of the campaign,” Guru Ghimire, a Congress leader, told the Post.Ghimire suggested that the party leaders should also gauge the strengths and weaknesses of other parties in the districts.Ghimire also advised the leaders not to use the campaign as an opportunity to promote factional activities.When public disenchantment towards the major parties is growing fast, the campaign the Congress has decided to carry forward could be a means to connect the leaders with the public, says a Congress leader.“This campaign will re-energise the relations between the party and the public, and the party should work hard to make this event fruitful without baggage of internal factions,” Sanjay Kumar Gautam, a Congress lawmaker, told the Post.Reconnecting with the public is a compulsion for the political parties, say political experts. Soon after the November 2022 election, major political parties including the Congress held several campaigns to reconnect with the people but the masses may not be quite impressed by the leaders’ announcements they make during the rallies unless they deliver when in power. Earlier, the CPN-UML carried out various drives such as ‘mission grassroots’, a march along Mid-Hill Highway. “Political parties’ efforts to get connected with the people is something commendable in itself,” Geja Sharma Wagle, a political analyst close to the Congress, told the Post. “But, if the political parties don’t deliver while they are in government, people might not be convinced by their pledges.”Wagle adds that as the Congress is in government, people take the leaders’ speeches seriously only if they work for them sincerely.During the 100-day campaign, the party has decided to inform the party members and local leaders regarding the seven-point agreement reached between the Congress and the CPN-UML on July 1. Based on the same agreement, the two parties formed the coalition government led by UML chair KP Sharma Oli on July 15. As per the deal, Oli will hand over the government leadership to Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba after two years.Besides their power-sharing in the federal government, the Congress and the UML have shared powers in provincial governments as well. While Koshi, Lumbini and Karnali provincial governments are led by the UML, Congress provincial lawmakers head Bagmati, Gandaki, and Sudurpaschim governments. The two big parties have backed Janamat Party to head the provincial government in Madhesh.During a meeting of the coalition partners held in Singha Durbar on September 9, Prime Minister Oli had reportedly complained that the coalition partners did not work enough to counter the ‘disinformation campaign of the opposition parties’ against the Oli government. “The opposition has spread confusion about the government, but the parties in government have not shown any interest in countering the disinformation,” the prime minister had reportedly said at the meeting. “All the ruling partners should defend the government.”Congress leaders will inform the party’s district representatives about the spirit of collaboration with the UML, constitutional amendments, and other issues. They are also responsible for informing the party members at the grassroots about policies such as the common minimum programme.Earlier this month, the Congress-UML coalition brought the programme that has, among other things, reiterated its commitment to reviewing the achievements made and weaknesses observed in the course of implementing the constitution in the past nine years. \nAfter being ousted from government for the first time in nine years, the CPN (Maoist Centre) appears to be at a turning point as it seeks to redefine its vision of socialism. In the wake of consultative meetings in seven provinces and its foreign units, party leaders have stressed the need for fresh ideas based on the party’s historic Chunwang meeting of 2005 that adopted ‘democratic republicanism’.Until this July, the party has continuously been in power since the promulgation of the constitution in 2015. Back during the insurgency days, the meeting held at Chunwang in Rukum district had endorsed the party’s political line advocating for promulgating a constitution through a constituent assembly. On this basis, the party in 2006 signed the Comprehensive Peace Accord with the then seven-party alliance and laid down arms to enter mainstream politics.The 2015 constitution envisions Nepal as a socialism-oriented country, with the Maoist Centre playing a key role in shaping that direction. But why, after all these years, is the party revisiting the question of socialism?Maoist Centre spokesman, Agni Sapkota, argues that the party has been discussing socialism in various forums. “But this time, we want a more intense and focussed discussion.” Tensions within the party also came to light during the party’s standing committee meeting in August where office bearers openly questioned the leadership of Pushpa Kamal Dahal. In response, the party decided to hold consultative meetings in all provinces to discuss the matter. Besides the provincial meetings, the party also consulted its foreign branches known as ‘pradesh committees’ in India, West Asia, and Eurasia.According to Sapkota, the Maoist Centre leadership got three mandates at the consultative meetings that concluded on September 20.“Besides the need for discussion on party ideology, the consultative meetings’ mandates include improving organisational management and updating party statute, changing leaders’ behaviour, and improving their secretariat work,” Sapkota told the Post. Likewise, another party leader, Dor Prasad Upadhyaya, says democratic socialism naturally aligns with the ideology of the Nepali Congress, whereas ‘people’s multiparty democracy’ is the ideology of the CPN-UML. “As for the Maoist Center, we lack a distinct political ideology clearly reflecting the party’s vision.”Although the party claims its ideology is ‘people’s democracy of the 21st century’, party leaders admit that its impact is diluted by lack of commitment. Party leaders said that there was no call for a leadership change during the consultative meetings. However, at the standing committee meeting in August, a deputy general secretary of the party, Janardan Sharma, submitted a 14-page document calling for a change in party leadership.Sharma and Barsha Man Pun—another deputy general secretary of the Maoist party—urged Dahal to pass over party reins to new generation leaders. According to leaders, some within the party feel that Dahal should not leave a leadership vacuum until a clear plan for leadership transition is in place.Likewise, Ram Karki, the party’s secretary, says the consultative meetings were focussed at preparing a political document that would be presented at the central committee meeting in November. “The consultative meetings were focused on the party’s diminishing influence in national politics,” Karki told the Post. “Despite our party leaders who were in government claiming that they did an excellent job, why hasn’t that reflected in the party’s life? This was a major concern expressed during the meetings.”Karki said the meeting also directed the party to remain open for cooperation with other parties with socialist inclinations. When asked about possible cooperation with the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), Karki dismissed the idea. “Lately, there have been some points of agreement between the two parties. But, I don’t see any prospect of the two parties getting into a working partnership,” Karki said. “The consultative meetings have said the party leadership is open to cooperation with socialist parties except the RSP.”The RSP—which was one of the junior partners in the immediate past government led by Maoist Centre chief Dahal before the government was toppled on July 12—appears to be on the same page with the Maoist Centre on many issues lately. But the two parties rule out cooperation on the political front.Party spokesperson Sapkota also says that his party can cooperate with the RSP in parliament on issues of public interest, but there is no possibility of forging a working alliance with the party. RSP chair Rabi Lamichhane, who presented his political document at the party's first national conference held for two days in Kathmandu earlier this month, also hinted at potential cooperation with like-minded parties. Despite this, RSP leaders declined cooperation with the Maoist Centre. The Maoist Centre’s consultative meetings have suggested that the party consider unification with other parties in order to revitalise the communist movement, Sapkota added.  \nThe Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), the fourth largest in Parliament, is fiercely resisting what it claims are government moves to arrest its chair, Rabi Lamichhane, over allegations of his involvement in cooperatives fraud. But all the other national parties seem to be in favour of his prosecution. Among the seven national parties in Parliament, there is a growing consensus for holding Lamichhane accountable. A party needs to win at least one FPTP seat and get three percent proportional representation votes to get national party status.Ruling coalition partners such as the Nepali Congress, the CPN-UML, Ashok Rai’s Janata Samajbadi Party, and the Janamat Party believe that RSP chair Lamichhane should face the law. Additionally, the CPN (Maoist Centre), the main opposition in Parliament, along with the Rastriya Prajantra Party and Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal (JSP-Nepal), both of which are outside the coalition, also support the parliamentary probe’s findings and advocate action against Lamichhane. The CPN (Unified Socialist), which is not a national party but has 10 seats in the lower house, has also joined the ranks of parties that want Lamichhane prosecuted. “Our party believes that, as a matter of principle, no innocent should be punished, and no guilty evade the law,” says the Maoist Centre Secretary Devendra Paudel.On the probe panel’s findings, Paudel said, “Evidence suggests that Lamichhane misused cooperative funds,” Paudel told the Post. “He should be held accountable for his actions as per the law.” A source close to Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak while talking to the Post said, “If everything goes as planned, the police will arrest Lamichhane soon.”However, during a recent interview with Kantipur Television’s Fireside program, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the chairman of the Maoist Centre, was noncommittal on whether Lamichhane should be prosecuted for misusing cooperative funds.But party secretary Paudel said his party would take a stand against Lamichhane’s misuse of cooperative funds.Unified Socialist spokesperson Jagannath Khatiwada says that the probe panel’s recommendations should be implemented. “Although our party has yet to take an official position on it, I can say that our leaders are discussing the parliamentary probe report and there is a general consensus that the report’s recommendations should be implemented.”“The report suggests that the government should further investigate and prosecute four key people [Rabi Lamichhane, GB Rai, Chhabi Joshi, and Kumar Ramtel] involved in the misuse of multiple cooperative funds, and our party supports the report,” Khatiwada told the Post. “Those proven guilty should be booked under the prevailing laws.” While Rai is on the run, Ramtel is in judicial custody of Kaski police. After arresting Joshi, Police are now waiting for the government’s green light to arrest Lamichhane, who has twice served as deputy prime minister and home minister.The Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal (JSP-Nepal), led by Upendra Yadav, also views Lamichhane as culpable in the misuse of the cooperative funds and disputes the RSP’s claim that he got a clean chit from the parliamentary special probe. “Our party does not want to disrespect any political leaders as such, but that does not mean a guilty individual should escape legal repercussions,” Manish Kumar Suman, the party central spokesperson, told the Post. “The report clearly indicates Lamichhane’s involvement in misusing cooperative funds, so there is no question of him getting a clear chit, unlike what the RSP leaders claim.” Rastriya Prajatantra Party Vice President Dhruba Bahadur Pradhan says the parliamentary probe panel, which investigated crisis-ridden cooperatives, has done its job and submitted a report and now it is the government’s responsibility to act on the recommendations.“As for our party’s position, Lamichhane should be prosecuted under the prevailing laws, as per the special committee’s report,” Pradhan told the Post. Lamichhane is accused of siphoning funds from multiple cooperatives to run the Gorkha Media Network, which operated the Galaxy 4k Television channel. The channel shut down last year. Chairman GB (Gitendra Babu) Rai and managing director Lamichhane jointly ran the media company before Lamichhane quit it to join politics in June 2022. On September 16, the parliamentary special committee submitted its report to Speaker Ghimire, who forwarded it to the government on the same day. On September 19, the Cabinet owned the report and ordered responsible ministries to act based on its findings. The probe panel’s report does not directly implicate Lamichhane in rerouting cooperative funds into the media, but it does label him guilty of using cooperative funds for Gorkha Media Network. The panel has recommended that the government prosecute Lamichhane; his business partner Rai; one of the founders of Gorkha Media Company, Chhabi Joshi; and board member Kumar Ramtel. As the panel report could not establish a direct link between Lamichhane and the rerouting of cooperative funds, RSP leaders interpret it as a ‘clean chit’ for their party chief. But leaders from other parties reject this claim.“The way RSP leaders are trying to interpret the probe panel’s report is distortion,” Pradhan said.Based on the report, the crime division of Nepal Police arrested Joshi, former deputy inspector general of Nepal Police and one of the founders of Gorkha Media Network, on the orders of Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak on Sunday. Following this, RSP chair Lamichhane organised a gathering of party sympathisers at his office to condemn the government amid rumours of his impending arrest. While addressing supporters at the RSP headquarters in Balaju, Kathmandu on Sunday evening, he urged them to be prepared to defend their new political force, claiming that a plan was afoot to ‘finish Rabi Lamichhane and the Rastriya Swatantra Party.’The erstwhile main opposition party, Nepali Congress, had continuously disrupted the parliamentary proceedings for over two months demanding a probe into the cooperatives scam, especially its connections to the Gorkha Media Network. In response, the immediate past government led by Maoist Centre chair Dahal had formed the parliamentary special probe panel.  \nRepresentatives at the first national conference of the Rastriya Swatantra Party saw factionalism within the party.Some of the representatives who arrived in Kathmandu three days ago for the two-day gathering starting on Tuesday said that growing factionalism is not healthy for the new political outfit promising to challenge traditional forces like the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML.“We were told that factionalism existed in our party in various forms, but we denied such claims. However, during our three days in Kathmandu, we witnessed it,” a group of party members told the Post. It seems that President Rabi Lamichhane and Vice-president Swarnim Wagle are not in the same boat on how the party should function, they added.RSP acting spokesperson Manish Jha explains that it is the lack of synchronisation—rather than differences—between the leaders. “People from various schools of thought came together to form the RSP. It is true that we lack synchronisation, but it would be wrong to portray it as differences.”Another leader of the party said on condition of anonymity that the party has two schools of thought—one based on democratic principles and the other opposed to it.RSP acting general secretary Kabindra Burlakoti claims that the party is united.In conversations with the Post, representatives from Kathmandu Valley, Pokhara and Chitwan sounded more optimistic with the central leadership while those from remote areas were confused over their take on the party’s central leadership.The representatives from Madhesh were mild in their opinion about the leadership.Moreover, representatives were also not very positive about the way the central leadership is investing their energy to claim that Lamichhane had got a clean chit from the parliamentary special committee formed to investigate crisis-ridden cooperatives.The probe panel, which submitted its report to the House of Representatives, has recommended the government prosecute Lamichhane, along with his former business partner GB (Gitendra Babu) Rai, board member of the media Kumar Ramtel and initial founder Chhabi Lal Joshi as per the prevailing laws. The inquiry committee, however, has said it couldn’t establish Lamichhane’s role in rerouting the cooperatives fund to Gorkha Media Network.“It would have been better had the central leadership waited to see how the government would take action,” the group of representatives from western Nepal told the Post. “In case Lamichhane is booked under the law, it could be counterproductive for the party in the long run.”The political campaign started by the RSP won’t get stalled even without Lamichhane, the representatives said, expressing their confidence in the party’s longevity.Lamichhane also presented a political report incorporating proposed statutory changes, the party’s commitments to voters, policy agenda presented by Swarnim Wagle at the Jaleshwar meeting and the conclusion drawn from the closed session of the national conference.Lamichhane’s report states that the policy paper presented in Jaleshwar defined ‘constitutional socialism’ as the party’s political ideology. Lamichhane also accuses the ruling Nepali Congress and CPN-UML of trying to lead the country to a two-party system by polarising smaller parties. “On the pretext of administrative reform, they are planning to wipe out the existence of small parties,” the report reads. “Potentially, this step can bring together new parties that want to be an alternative political force sooner or later.”Asked about RSP’s possible alliance with other parties, Burlakoti said though they are not in talks with the main opposition CPN (Maoist Centre), they are in regular contact with several independent candidates of last election.Asked if they are in discussion with Kathmandu Metropolitan City Mayor Balendra Shah, who won the 2022 local election independently, Burlakoti said: “Strategic moves are not to be disclosed.”However, when the national conference concluded after Lamichhane presented his report, representatives arriving from around the country were displeased.“This is not the way a party functions,” a representative told the Post, asking not to be named for fears of reprisal.When leaders put themselves at the centre and cadres in the periphery, the party’s downfall begins, another representative said. Acting General Secretary Burlakoti, however, defended the party leadership. “Our national conference was designed this way,” Burlakoti said. The report presented by the chair will be discussed in the party’s Mahakali-Mechi campaign that will start soon, he added.“At the national conference, we gave 5 percent of the total representatives (1500) time to speak, but those who spoke exceeded that number,” Burlakoti said.The conference, however, passed Lamichhane’s report. On Wednesday, Lamichhane announced the date of the party’s first general convention. It will be held on May 8-10 at a yet-undecided venue.“I would like to inform you that the Central Committee has become the general convention organising committee,” Burlakoti said. Lamichhane also announced the ‘Mahakali-Mechi Campaign’ to interact with the general public.In his report, Lamichhane has proposed a person not affiliated to any party to be elected the country’s president, directly elected executive head, or the prime minister. He also proposes giving the nation’s vice president the responsibility to chair the National Assembly.While the paper bats for a fully proportional electoral system, it says provincial assemblies cannot be accepted in the current shape.However, this does not mean the RSP is against the federal structure gained through the sacrifice of thousands of people, another representative said. “Our party has no strength to amend the constitution and scrap the federal structure. Therefore, for the time being, voices are growing among the party members about accepting the present political structure,” Khemraj Koirala, a conference representative from Kailali told the Post.Party members also suggested downsizing the number of ministers to make the provincial system functional, Koirala said.The report also stands for reducing the number of municipalities to less than 500, from the current 753. \nThe coalition government of the CPN-UML and the Nepali Congress has reiterated its commitment to review the achievements made and weaknesses observed in the course of implementing the constitution in the past nine years.The two ruling parties have pledged to amend the constitution based on a broader understanding made through discussions, dialogues and consultations with political parties, civil society, intelligentsia, constitutional experts and the public.The parties have said such amendments will be made mainly based on the findings of the review and experiences of implementing it. Moreover, the parties said that establishing political stability in the country would be the major objective of the amendment.The two ruling parties made the commitments in the common minimum programme of the government, which was submitted to Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli and Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba on Wednesday evening. The parties had earlier formed a four-member panel to draft the government’s programme based on a seven-point agreement reached between the Congress and the UML in the first week of July. Party general secretary Gagan Thapa and spokesperson Prakash Sharan Mahat from Congress, and party deputy general secretaries Pradeep Gyawali and Bishnu Rimal from the CPN-UML were tasked to prepare the document. They jointly submitted the document to the two party chiefs and made it public.“The achievements of the 2006 movement and the fundamental pillars of this constitution including federal, republic and inclusive governance system will be further institutionalised and strengthened,” the document says.The seven-page document is divided into eight subtitles—safeguarding national interest and independent foreign policy; protection, implementation and amendment of the constitution; good governance and quality service delivery; dynamic economy and development; ensuring social justice and fundamental rights; youth partnership; transitional justice, sustainable peace and social harmony; and miscellaneous.The coalition has pledged to set up a high-powered cooperative regulatory body as per the recommendation of the parliamentary inquiry committee to address the problems seen in the cooperative sector.“Taking action against those involved in misusing funds from cooperatives, the return of depositors’ money will be ensured,” the common minimum programme states.The ruling parties have pledged to punish corrupt people irrespective of the individuals’ power and positions. On the economic front, the coalition has vowed to expedite generation and transmission of hydroelectricity and further intensify the electrification process. \nTicket bookings for public transport during the Dashain festival will open this Saturday. Following discussions with stakeholders, the Department of Transport Management announced that tickets will be available online and at counters to manage the expected surge of nearly two million travellers leaving the Kathmandu Valley for the festivities.According to the department’s Director General, Rajiv Pokharel, transport operators will facilitate online bookings. “We have instructed operators to arrange online bookings wherever possible,” he said. “For counter bookings, passengers must obtain tickets only from official staff wearing uniforms and identification badges.”Around two million people are estimated to leave the Kathmandu Valley during Dashain. The department has introduced 20-point directives to ensure safe and hassle-free travel. Key measures include mandatory checks for alcohol consumption by drivers at major entry and exit points and the requirement for two drivers on long-distance routes. Additionally, those under 18 cannot work as assistant drivers.To assist travellers during Dashain, Tihar, and Chhath festivals, citizen help desks will be established at major locations such as Nagdhunga, Kalanki, Swayambhu, Halchowk, Machhapokhari, Gongabu Bus Park, Chabahil, Tilganga, Koteshwar, Jagati, Satdobato, Balkhu, Dakshinkali, Sundhara, and Sangha in Kavre. An inspection team comprising officials from various agencies will monitor travel arrangements with support from provincial transport ministries.Public transport operating on long and medium-distance routes must follow a designated queue system. Transport expert Ashish Gajurel noted that although bookings are open each year, passengers face difficulties. \"Bus operators don’t increase the number of buses during Dashain, despite rising demand. Authorities must increase the number of buses to ease travel,\" he said.Saroj Sitaula, senior vice-president of the Federation of Nepalese National Transport Entrepreneurs, however, argued that ‘unnecessary’ vehicle checks should be avoided to prevent inconvenience for passengers and drivers. He also highlighted the need to repair potholes on roads to ensure smooth travel.Earlier, Minister for Physical Infrastructure and Transport Devendra Dahal instructed the Department of Roads to complete road repairs nationwide before Ghatasthapana, the first day of the 15-day Dashain festival. The department reported that repairs are underway but have been delayed by the monsoon.The Narayanghat-Butwal road section, part of the East-West Highway, remains a major concern, with only 52.7 percent of its upgrade completed after six years of construction and multiple deadline extensions. The Meteorological Forecasting Division of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology has predicted chances of rainfall in various places of the country for a couple of days more, raising concerns about travel difficulties during Dashain. Other problematic sections include Nagdhunga-Mugling and Mugling-Pokhara, with landslides and potholes reported along various highways, including the Mid-Hill, Madan Bhandari, Hulaki, and BP highways. \nPanic gripped locals in ward 12 of Chandragiri Municipality, Kathmandu, on Thursday morning after a suspicious object was found in the locality.The suspicious object was spotted in front of Balambu Secondary School, sparking fears of a bomb threat.Locals informed the police, and a bomb disposal team from the Nepal Army arrived at the scene. According to the NA Directorate of Public Relations and Information, the team disposed of the suspicious object, which turned out to be a pressure cooker.   \nKathmandu Metropolitan City has extended the area to prohibit building any structure on either side of the rivers in its territory.In a notice on Wednesday, the city office stated that construction of any structure has been barred on the additional 20 meters from the existing prohibited area.According to the metropolis notice, if the city has, under the existing rule, prohibited any construction on 20 meters from the area marked as river, the prohibited area will now be altogether 40 meters on either side of the waterway.The metropolis said the decision was taken based on a recent Supreme Court verdict that directed the authorities concerned to prohibit construction within an additional 20 metres from riverbanks in the Kathmandu Valley.Currently, construction is permitted only 20 metres beyond major riverbanks in the Kathmandu metropolis.The notice issued by the metropolis states, “No construction will be permitted on an additional 20 metres of land on either side of the river, and ongoing construction will be halted.”It has also asked one and all not to release contaminated water, including sewage, into Bagmati River and its tributaries. “Private and government buildings, as well as commercial properties, must install soak pits for groundwater recharge,” it said. “Waste must not be disposed of in the rivers. Non-compliance will lead to legal action under existing laws.” \nThe rhythmic beat of the Dha echoes through a Bhaktapur alley, blending with the energetic footsteps of dancers. Bhaktapur, which sees jatras and festivals round the year, is no stranger to music, dance and celebrations. But this is not an ordinary occasion. The performers in question are Lakhe dancers who are reviving the Ranjitkar Lakhe dance after a century.The young dancers are preparing for Indra Jatra this year, where mask-clad Lakhe dancers roam the streets to rid the community of hardships and suffering. Lakhe, demon deities revered as protectors of people and crops, are thought to reside in the demonic mask. As the dancer dons the mask, the spirit is said to take over.Bhaktapur was once a key site for the Ranjitkar Lakhe performances, but the art form vanished from the city after the 1934 earthquake.“Bhaktapur suffered the most damage during the 1934 earthquake,\" says Ganesh Ram Ranjit, treasurer of the Ranjitkar Group’s Bhaktapur branch. “The destruction left residents struggling to recover for a decade, making it nearly impossible to perform the costly Lakhe dance.”The Ranjitkar Group discovered the extinct dance in the year the group was established. They located a Lakhe temple in Bhaktapur that had closed after the earthquake. After two years of research, they learned that performing the Lakhe dance was seen as a good omen in Bhaktapur and involved hosting community feasts. However, the high cost of this tradition forced many to sell their properties, rendering it unfeasible in the city’s post-earthquake conditions. Over time, the dance was abandoned as more lands supporting these cultural events were lost during rapid urbanisation.“There was a significant decline in our engagement with our cultural heritage,” says Rabi Shakya, a sculptor and Lakhe dance teacher training the new dancers. “The encouraging change now is the strong interest from the new generation, which is making it possible to revive intangible heritage like this dance.”After 100 years, the Ranjitkar Lakhe Dance is making a return to Bhaktapur at this year’s Indra Jatra.“It’s challenging to accurately re-enact the dance since it hasn’t been seen in a century,” Shakya notes. “As a sculptor, I drew inspiration from Bhaktapur’s revered Shree Navadurga Bhawani to create the Lakhe’s mask.” Similarly, the dance was choreographed by studying Lakhe dances from Kathmandu, Patan, and Banepa within the Ranjitkar community, and combining them with traditional steps from Bhaktapur Lakhe dances.“As for the musical instruments, we are using traditional instruments like Dha, Dhime, and Ponga, which are said to excite the Lakhe,” says Rajendra Maharjan, Lakhe dance teacher and musician.Maharjan is one of the experienced Newari arts teachers working to revive the lost Lakhe dance. He is involved in training young students in cultural arts and is now dedicated to the Ranjitkar dance training, with the students practising together nearly every day.“Becoming a Lakhe performer involves more than just wearing the costume and mask,” said Sudin Ranjit, a Lakhe dance student. “We must train extensively with our teachers, and it demands a lot of hard work.”To Ranjit, a resident of Bhaktapur, the training is more than learning a new craft; it is a matter of protecting culture. Growing up only interested in instruments, he slowly understood how important continuing cultural practices like Lakhe dances is for their community.“The dance will not only bolster Bhaktapur’s cultural pride but also boost tourism and create jobs,” says Dr Purushottam Lochan Shrestha, a professor and researcher specialising in Bhaktapur and Newari culture.Shrestha notes that reviving the dance would offer employment to everyone involved, from the dancers and the sculptor making the masks to those participating in the rituals. “Economic centres throughout the city, from small businesses to large industries, will benefit from the influx of tourists attracted by the Lakhe dance,” Shrestha adds, commending the Ranjitkar group's initiative.Once the Ranjitkar community revitalises the Lakhe dance, the Ranjitkar group plans to set up a new Guthi house with a fresh community fund and organise annual events for the dance.“The Lakhe dance won’t let them separate,” Shakya remarks.In today’s globalised world, where identity often merges into a homogenised blend, shared cultural practices provide a sense of connection and belonging. This new Lakhe dance embodies that spirit of togetherness for the community involved.“Reviving the dance after 100 years,” Shakya says, “is about preserving our culture for the next 300 years.” \nThe Lions Club of Kathmandu Corporate, Nepal MD325-D has felicitated various personalities as part of its endeavour to recognise the contribution of the individuals and business entities for the society.As part of its campaign, the Lions Club of Kathmandu honoured Prateek Pradhan with Social Journalism Award, Sylapa T Rimponche with Social Spiritual Award, Erika Gurung with Social Player Award, Ramesh Corporation with Social Corporate House Award, Rajendra Malla with Social Corporate Leader Award and Rajesh Hamal with Social Celebrity Award.Likewise, Chandra Ghimire is honoured with Social Bureaucratic Award, Binod Das with Sports Management Award, Anil Kedia with Social Academic Award, Mohan Ojha with Social Management Award and Surya Nepal with Corporate Social Responsibility Award.The Lionism embarked in Nepal in 1971 as the Lions Club of Biratnagar under the stewardship of former Prime Minister Matrika Prasad Koirala.The Lions Clubs International says it has over 2,000 clubs operating across the nation. \nNepal's economic growth is projected to accelerate to 5.1 percent in the current fiscal year from 3.9 percent in the last fiscal year, driven by anticipated high tourist arrivals and increased hydropower and paddy production, according to the World Bank’s latest economic update, released on Wednesday.The Nepal Development Update: International Migration and Well-being in Nepal, which has not updated the losses incurred by late September rain disasters, said the private sector is expected to contribute to the country’s growth, as it is anticipated to benefit from the central bank’s loosening of monetary policy and easing of regulatory requirements. Nepal’s economy is projected to grow by 5.5 percent in the next fiscal year, 2025-26.However, the World Bank’s report identifies multiple risks to the outlook, including heightened vulnerabilities in the financial system such as a rise in non-performing loans that may limit private sector credit growth, potential policy discontinuity that could deter investment, delays in the execution of the capital spending budget affecting infrastructure development, and regional instability and trade disruptions that could reduce tourism and domestic demand.\"Nepal's economy is on a gradual recovery path,\" said Shiva Raj Adhikari, vice chairman of the National Planning Commission. \"Our focus on enhancing capital expenditure, particularly by completing nearly finished projects, along with reforms in the budgetary process, will strengthen macroeconomic stability, boost domestic productivity, and create more jobs.\"Shocks in migrant-receiving countries such as the Gulf Cooperation Council countries and Malaysia, could also slow growth, impacting international remittances that are crucial for raising household consumption, reducing poverty, and developing human capital. However, migration from Nepal is costly, opportunities are unequal, and the process remains challenging for many. The report presents the latest evidence on the benefits and costs of Nepal’s emigration trend. It highlights key policy interventions needed to build an inclusive migration management system that ensures sustainability and maximises rewards.“Maintaining growth momentum is key to Nepal’s development. This requires continued reform in critical areas such as infrastructure, governance human capital development, and developing an environment which encourages and supports the private sector,” said David Sislen, World Bank Country Director for Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka.“Nepal has greatly benefited from remittances from overseas workers and improving the management of these inflows, better supporting Nepalis who choose to seek work abroad, and also building a vibrant domestic economy which allows for skilled Nepalis to be productive in Nepal is critical to the future of the country.”The World Bank said that an inclusive migration management system would establish a transparent recruitment process, better prepare migrants to go abroad, ensure their safety and mobility in those labor markets, plan for long-term skills and destination diversification, and create an economic environment conducive to harnessing the capital and skills of returnees. \n\nHeavy to very heavy rainfall that continued for 48 hours last week triggered floods and landslides, causing an estimated Rs17 billion in losses to Nepal’s economy, according to the government’s preliminary report unveiled on Tuesday. Economists, however, say the actual losses could be more than three times the preliminary estimate. The agriculture sector took the hardest hit, suffering significant damages.The late-monsoon rainfall flooded and inundated large acreage of crops, with the government projecting an initial loss of Rs6 billion. “This is a preliminary estimate. Losses in the agriculture sector could be staggering,” said an agro-economist at the Department of Agriculture.“The crop losses will have a significant impact on the economy. It will reduce the economic growth rate, increase food prices, reduce farmers’ income, and the food imports will balloon,” he said. “Higher food prices are especially heavy on low-income households, who already spend much of their income on food.”Over the past decades, natural disasters have become increasingly frequent and intense, posing significant risks to economic activities. Nepal’s rain-fed economy has borne the brunt of the monsoon rainfall, which was earlier projected to benefit the country’s ailing agriculture sector. It, however, turned nasty.Chief Secretary Eknarayan Aryal told a press conference in Singha Durbar on Tuesday that the agriculture sector, the lifeline of Nepal’s economy, suffered the biggest losses, amounting to Rs6 billion. This was followed by the energy sector, which suffered a loss of Rs4 billion, water supply Rs3.55 billion, road Rs2.52 billion, and irrigation Rs1 billion.Aryal said that 21 districts were affected, with Sindhuli, Kavrepalanchok, Sindhupalchok, Dhading and the Kathmandu Valley the hardest hit. He said the floods and landslides damaged 37 highways, 312 telecom sites, five major transmission lines, and 16 hydropower projects with a combined capacity of 664 MW.“The destruction was huge. But it’s too early to quantify the exact losses,” said Keshav Acharya, an economist. “Our rough estimate shows that the September disaster may shave off 1 percent from the national GDP,” he said. This translates to Rs57 billion in losses.“Key sectors like service and agriculture, drivers of Nepal’s economic growth, have been hit hard,” said Acharya. “The disaster affected Nepal’s economic hub—the Kathmandu Valley, which accounts for one-fourth of the GDP.”The government may take months to develop the final loss estimates, but experts say before making tall promises to immediately begin the reconstruction drive, it must first assess the health of its treasury. “The government is bankrupt,” said Nara Bahadur Thapa, former executive director of the research department of Nepal Rastra Bank. The government, already in a budget deficit, still owes around Rs40 billion to contractors, Rs13 billion to state-owned commercial banks in interest subsidies, and nearly Rs13 billion to the insurance and health sectors. According to Thapa, the disaster may cause an economic upheaval if not prudently addressed.Agriculture and energy output may drop sharply. Now, instead of exporting electricity to India, Nepal has to buy it. The disaster will also affect tourism. People will not travel, and the transport sector will be hit. And when people don’t travel in the festive season, consumption will be hit. Before the September 28-29 rainfall, the Asian Development Bank projected Nepal’s growth to be 4.9 percent due to a good harvest caused by the regular and strong monsoon, the prospect of energy trade, and improved tourist arrivals.“The disaster has become a headache for the government. It is facing a budget deficit, and funding reconstruction and providing relief would require a huge sum of money, which the government does not have,” said Thapa.Aryal, the chief secretary, told the press meeting that the government’s priority would be relief and reconstruction. However, he did not explain how to fund them.The government said 30,731 security personnel were mobilised for search and rescue.According to the Armed Police Force, the death toll from the disaster has risen to 238, with 29 people still missing. The report said that the disaster destroyed 1,769 houses and 55 bridges.Nepal is bearing the brunt of climate change.According to a recent survey report, climate change has profound impacts on Nepal’s economy, particularly on agriculture, water resources, and biodiversity.The National Climate Change Survey 2022, released by the National Statistics Office (formerly the Central Bureau of Statistics) paints a stark picture of Nepal's climate change situation and urges urgent intervention for the resource-starved Himalayan nation.According to the survey, the economic losses in farm and off-farm in the last five years, as reported by households, excluding significant infrastructure damage, amounted to Rs415.44 billion.At the UN General Assembly in New York, just a few days before the disaster in Nepal unfolded, Nepal’s Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli urged global leaders to take action, including by adequately financing climate adaptation and establishment of a loss and damage fund for vulnerable nations like Nepal.“None of the global challenges we face today has been imposed by aliens. These are of our own making,” he said. “Through understanding, trust, and cooperation, we can overcome them.”On Tuesday, back home in Nepal, Oli told the press meeting that the government would compensate farmers for their losses. “We will send teams to different disaster-hit areas to assess losses. We will also provide relief for the people whose houses have been damaged and who are not insured.”“The government will take short, medium and long-term measures to tackle the problems. Yes, we showed some shortcomings in rescue operations, which will be corrected.”The government plans to complete the search and rescue work within a few days and distribute the relief through a unified system. Chief Secretary Aryal informed that the homeless will be allowed to build temporary housing in a place designated by the government.This year, at the start of the monsoon season, South Asian meteorologists had said that most of the region, including Nepal, would get above-normal monsoon rainfall, which is good for Nepal’s rain-fed agriculture system.However, experts have said it was also a warning sign. Excess rain can result in disasters and may offset economic gains. “We were not prepared for this kind of situation… for a disaster of this scale,” the prime minister said.  \nUS President Joe Biden will announce on Tuesday the donation of 1 million mpox vaccine doses and at least $500 million to African countries to support their response to the outbreak, according to a senior administration official.Biden will make the announcement in New York, where he is attending the United Nations General Assembly, and call on other countries to follow suit, the person told Reuters.In August, the World Health Organization declared mpox a global public health emergency for the second time in two years, following an outbreak of the viral infection in the Democratic Republic of Congo that has spread to neighbouring countries and beyond, including India, raising alarm.“It wouldn’t be a huge surprise if there were a case in the United States, either,” the official said, noting that recent cuts in pandemic support by Congress may hamper a domestic response.“We’re really squeezing right now to be able to respond effectively in this moment. And I think anticipating potentially additional cuts in the future will make it more and more difficult for us to have a robust response to these types of outbreaks.”Mpox can spread through close contact. Usually mild, it is fatal in rare cases. It causes flu-like symptoms and pus-filled lesions on the body.The outbreak in Congo began with the spread of an endemic strain, known as clade I. But a new variant, clade Ib, appears to spread more easily through routine close contact, including sexual contact.The expectation is that the US donated doses will be of the Bavarian Nordic vaccine known as Jynneos in the United States, and many will come from a stockpile in the United States. The 1 million doses is in addition to the 60,000 previously donated shots.The US official said the administration expects Gavi, a public-private alliance which co-funds vaccine purchases for low-income countries, to distribute the donated vaccines.“We feel really strongly that Gavi is the multilateral institution that is best positioned to procure and equitably distribute vaccines,” the official said.Last week, Gavi said it will buy 500,000 doses of Bavarian Nordic's vaccine, its first purchase to help battle the outbreak.The Biden administration is also pushing for more vaccines to be manufactured in low and middle-income countries, and is working with Brazil to identify how the Group of 20 club of nations can support the mpox response.There is not currently a manufacturer in Africa that is able to make the complex drug substance needed to make the vaccine, the US official said. \nAt least 190 women from 51 districts died of complications during childbirth in the fiscal year 2023-024, data provided by the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services show. The actual number of maternal deaths due to birth-related complications could be much higher, as maternal and perinatal death surveillance is being carried out in 51 districts only, officials say.“Maternal deaths from childbirth-related complications could be significantly underreported, as we are only tracking cases in 51 districts,” said Nisha Joshi, a public health official at the division. “We have no data on maternal and perinatal deaths in the rest of the districts.”In the fiscal year 2022-023, 191 maternal deaths were recorded across 49 districts. Nepal reduced the maternal mortality rate from 239 per 100,000 births in 2016 to 151 per 100,000 in 2021, according to the national census carried out by the National Statistics Office. Earlier, the country had reduced the maternal mortality rate from 539 per 100,000 births in 1996 to 239 per 100,000 births in 2016—for which the country even received a Millennium Development Goals award. The health target under the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals is to reduce the maternal mortality rate to 75 per 100,000 births by 2030.The latest census report has shown that 622 maternal deaths were recorded in a year. Officials at the Health Ministry concede that the number of deaths reported from 51 districts is only around 30 percent of the total maternal deaths occurring across the country.They complained that the lack of maternal and perinatal death surveillance programmes in all districts is the main reason for the underreporting of maternal deaths. “Due to budget constraints, we could not expand the maternal and perinatal death surveillance to other districts this year,” said Joshi. “We also have problems in the reporting system, and deaths that occur in villages of the districts without surveillance programmes go unreported.”Maternal health experts say that concerned authorities are keeping themselves in the dark by not conducting studies in all districts. “Without knowing the actual situation, effective planning is not possible, which means efforts to reduce ongoing deaths may not succeed,” said Dr Ganesh Dangal, a maternal health expert. A huge budget is not necessary to carry out death surveillance. So this programme should be enforced mandatorily in all districts immediately.”Maternal and perinatal death surveillance is a key intervention for improving maternal, perinatal, and neonatal survival rates. Experts say such surveillance provides an understanding of the number and causes of deaths, enabling more targeted and effective interventions.Nepal strives to reduce the deaths of mothers and babies. However, it lacks maternal and perinatal death surveillance in all districts.Perinatal death is the death of a baby between 22 weeks of gestation (or weighing 500g) and seven days after birth.The World Health Organisation said that maternal and perinatal death surveillance and response (MPDSR) is an essential quality improvement intervention, which permits the identification, notification, quantification and determination of causes and avoidability of maternal and neonatal deaths and stillbirth to orient the measures necessary for their prevention.According to the UN health body, systematic analyses of overall mortality trends and events and contributing factors leading to individual deaths can identify barriers in health systems and inspire local solutions to prevent such deaths in the future.Studies carried out in the past show that excessive bleeding after childbirth, pre-eclampsia and eclampsia (pregnancy-related high blood pressure disorders) are some of the reasons for maternal deaths.The World Health Organisation said postpartum haemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal mortality in low-income countries and the primary cause of nearly a quarter of all maternal deaths globally. Most deaths resulting from the said complication occur during the first 24 hours after birth.Gynaecologists say tears in the cervix or tissues of the vagina, tear in a blood vessel in the uterus, bleeding in hidden tissue area or space in the pelvis, blood clotting disorders, and placenta problems are among the causes of postpartum haemorrhage.Every year, over 600,000 women deliver babies in Nepal. \nAs many as 17 people, including children, have died, and 63 others have been infected with the Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus since the start of the monsoon in June this year.Twenty-nine districts, including those in the Kathmandu Valley, have reported infection from the deadly virus, while 12 districts—Kailali, Kapilvastu, Palpa, Chitwan, Parsa, Rautahat, Sarlahi, Siraha, Dhanusha, Sindhuli, Jhapa and Sunsari—have reported deaths from the infection.“We have alerted agencies concerned to conduct awareness drives and implement other prevention measures in the districts where Japanese encephalitis infections or deaths have been reported,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division. “We have also requested various aid agencies, including the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation, to supply JE vaccine.”Japanese encephalitis is a viral brain infection caused by the JE virus, which is endemic in Asia and parts of the Western Pacific. According to the World Health Organization, it is a mosquito-borne flavivirus, belonging to the same family as dengue, Zika, yellow fever, and West Nile viruses. The virus kills a third of those who fall ill and leaves up to half of those who survive with severe life-long disabilities, according to the UN health body.Officials say that September and October are the peak months for JE outbreaks.Health officials say this year’s death rate from the JE virus has exceeded 27 percent, and among the deceased, the number of children under 15 years of age is very high. Nepal has included the vaccine in its routine immunisation list, which the government provides free of cost to all children.The country started administering the vaccine doses in 2006, eight years before the World Health Organization officially issued prequalification certification, due to the high infection and deaths from the virus at the time. In 2005, JE killed nearly 2,000 people in Nepal—mostly children from the districts of Tarai region. In the first phase, all populations of the highly-affected four districts, Banke, Bardia, Dang, and Kailali, were inoculated with the JE vaccine. Later, the vaccination programme was expanded to 19 other affected districts, and children under 15 were inoculated.The government integrated the JE vaccine into the routine immunisation list in 2015. Even though the vaccine is included in the regular immunisation list, several people still die, and dozens get infected by the deadly virus every year.Data from the Health Ministry show that less than 50 percent of the infected patients were found inoculated with the vaccine.Doctors say the disease has no cure, so treatment focuses on managing symptoms. However, safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent infection. Health officials said they are aware of the deadly disease outbreak and have already started consulting aid agencies for help to finance the JE vaccination programme.However, officials at the Department of Health Services said that none of the donors have taken health officials' requests seriously or shown interest in supporting the immunisation drive.Public health experts say that this is the right time to vaccinate all those at risk. Even if the vaccine does not help in outbreak management, it provides immunity from future infections. The JE virus is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected Culex mosquitoes. Pigs and ducks are considered natural reservoirs of the virus.Doctors advise taking precautions to avoid mosquito bites, such as using mosquito repellents, wearing long-sleeved clothes, and getting vaccinated if one lives in or is travelling to disease-endemic areas. They also stress the importance of awareness and timely treatment to prevent infections and deaths.An estimated 12.5 million people are thought to be at high risk of JE infection in Nepal. \nDusit Princess Kathmandu is organising a five-day trout festival at its SOI restaurant. The dishes will be available for order from 12:30 pm to 10:00 pm every day till August 30. In celebration of Nepal’s rivers and lakes, which provide an ideal environment for high-quality trout, the Director of Culinary Food and Beverage Service, Chef Utpal Mondal, and his team at Dusit Princess Kathmandu have crafted a menu showcasing the flavours and versatility of locally sourced trout. “As the festive month of Shrawan ends, people focus on healthy and nutritious food. Trout, rich in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and essential minerals, offers a heart-friendly option that checks all the boxes from a nutritional and culinary standpoint,” says Mondal.He adds that the goal of the culinary event is to offer their guests a rare opportunity to experience a wide variety of trout dishes they wouldn’t typically find at home.The event menu features twelve unique dishes, six of which are drawn from diverse culinary traditions across continents. Three dishes are inspired by oriental cuisine, while the remaining three highlight flavours from Nepal and India. The menu has been designed to include various dishes, from soups and starters to main courses, including Mexican, Italian, Continental, and Thai flavours.While discussing the event’s highlights, Mondal said, “The celebration presents a unique opportunity for guests to indulge in a diverse range of trout-based dishes, something they wouldn’t typically have the chance to experience elsewhere.” \nA novice baker embarks on a culinary journey, learning through trial and error the importance of precise measurements, ingredients, and techniques in achieving successful baked creations.\nThe Stonewall Riots catalyzed the LGBTQIA+ rights movement, leading to the creation of safe spaces like Inclusive Galaxy, a haven for the queer community that promotes financial independence and fosters societal acceptance.\nNepali chef Aditya Mishra, recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship, promotes Nepali cuisine in New York through his restaurant 'The Sewing Tin', showcasing traditional dishes with modern influences like Confit Duck Chatamari, and highlighting the immigrant experience in the city.\nCeleus Baral, a 21-year-old environmental science student, launched Bakeleus, an online baking shop, in 2021, using her knowledge of baking science and passion for nature to create unique sweet treats from scratch.\nThe noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built. Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \nFrom producing films to trekking Everest, the author's journey has been marked by nature's lessons, personal resilience, and the pursuit of life's meaning through art and adventure.\nA 5-day whirlwind tour of Sri Lanka covered 1,000 kilometers, showcasing religious sites, heritage landmarks, cultural attractions, and the nation's resurgent tourism industry despite economic challenges, with direct flights connecting Nepal and Sri Lanka.\nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nKarnali Yashvis continued their winning start in the Everest Women’s Volleyball League as they defeated Lalitpur Queens in straight sets of 3-0 at the National Sports Council’s covered hall in Kathmandu on Wednesday.Lalitpur, who ended Tuesday on the top of table with a 25-15, 26-24, 24-26, 25-23 victory over Madhesh United in the evening late fixture, started the day’s event on Wednesday and battled till the end but lost each set by a thin margin.Karnali won the first and the second sets 25-22, 25-22 and were 9-1 behind at one point in the third set. But they fought back to rally to a 29-27 victory.It was their third victory in as many matches as they now remain the only team to keep an unbeaten streak in the league.Karnali had defeated Madhesh United and Gandaki Thunders in their previous clashes.The victory also fired Karnali to the summit of the standings with eight points. Lalitpur, who have two victories, are on six points.The top two teams at the end of the single round robin league will progress into the final, which is taking place on October 5. \nNepal all-rounder Dipendra Singh Airee climbed up four spots to reach the second position in the International Cricket Council’s Men’s T20I all-rounder rankings on Wednesday.Airee received a career-best rating of 230 to leave behind Australia’s Marcus Stoinis (211), Zimbabwe’s Sikandar Raza (208), Sri Lanka’s Wanindu Hasaranga (206), Afghanistan’s Mohammad Nabi (205) and India’s Hardik Pandya (199).This is the highest position a Nepali cricketer has achieved in ICC rankings.England’s Liam Livingstone is ranked number one in the all-rounder rankings with a rating of 253.Gulsan Jha improved 11 positions to climb up to 53rd position, while Kushal Bhurtel also moved six positions up to 60 in the rankings.Rohit Paudel is also ranked 53rd, while Karan KC is in the 71st position. \nBabar Azam has resigned as Pakistan’s white-ball cricket captain for a second time in 11 months, citing a need to lessen his workload and focus on improving his game.Babar stepped down as captain of all three formats last year after Pakistan failed to make the knockout stage of the 50-overs World Cup, before returning as white-ball skipper in March ahead of the Twenty20 World Cup, where Pakistan did not make it to the Super Eight stage.“It’s been an honour to lead this team, but it’s time for me to step down and focus on my playing role,” Babar wrote in a post on X on Tuesday.“Captaincy has been a rewarding experience, but it’s added a significant workload. I want to prioritise my performance, enjoy my batting, and spend quality time with my family, which brings me joy.“By stepping down, I will gain clarity moving forward and focus more energy on my game and personal growth.”Pakistan won just six of the 13 T20 matches they played under Babar in his second stint, and the 2009 champions were involved in the T20 World Cup’s biggest upset when they were beaten by hosts the United States.He did not take charge of any one-day international matches.Pakistan will host England in three tests starting in Multan on Monday, before travelling to Australia for ODI and T20 matches in November. \nCanada secured a four-wicket victory over Nepal in the fourth match of the Canada T20 Tri-Series, held at the Maple Leaf North-West Ground, King City, Canada.The hosts chased the 140-run target set by the Rhinos with three balls to spare.Canada faced an early setback when Navneet Dhaliwal was bowled by Lalit Rajbanshi for 12 off 16 balls in the fifth over.Harsh Thaker, who followed, scored 11 off 9 deliveries before falling to Rajbanshi, leaving Canada at 45-2 in the eighth over. Captain Nicholas Kirton provided some stability, blasting 26 from just 14 balls, including two sixes, before being dismissed by Sompal Kami.Canada’s innings faltered again when Dilpreet Bajwa, who had anchored the innings with 25 off 29 balls, was run out in the 12th over.When Shreyas Movva was stumped by Aasif Sheikh off Sandeep Lamichhane shortly after, and Dilon Heyliger fell for a duck two balls later, Canada were in trouble at 90-6 in the 15th over.However, the lower order provided the rescue. Ravinderpal Singh and Saad Bin Zafar forged a crucial unbeaten partnership to guide Canada to victory. Zafar was instrumental, scoring a quickfire 33 not out off 18 balls, with four boundaries and a six, while Ravinderpal contributed an unbeaten 20 runs from 21 balls.Nepal’s bowling attack was led by Sandeep Lamichhane and Lalit Rajbanshi, who took two wickets each, with Rajbanshi delivering a particularly economical spell of 4-0-20-2.Earlier, Nepal, having been put into bat, posted a total of 139-6 in their 20 overs. Opener Anil Sah was the standout performer for Nepal, scoring 41 off 30 balls with four boundaries and three sixes. He provided a solid start alongside Aasif Sheikh, who made 30 from 30 deliveries. The pair shared a 70-run opening partnership before Sah was dismissed by Harsh Thaker in the 10th over.Nepal’s middle order struggled to capitalise on the strong start. Captain Rohit Paudel was dismissed cheaply for 4, caught by Ravinderpal Singh off Thaker. Kushal Malla and Kushal Bhurtel also failed to make an impact, with Malla scoring 4 off 12 balls and Bhurtel managing 13 off 15 before losing their wickets.However, Gulsan Jha provided a late surge, remaining unbeaten on 23 off 16 balls, including two sixes. He was supported by Dipendra Singh Airee, who chipped in with 12 off 9 deliveries, and Karan KC, who blasted 8 off just 2 balls in the final over.Canada’s bowlers delivered an impressive performance that restricted Nepal’s scoring. Saad Bin Zafar was particularly effective, conceding just 13 runs from his four overs while picking up the wicket of Aasif Sheikh. Harsh Thaker was the leading wicket-taker with 2-17 from his four overs, while Parveen Kumar and Akhil Kumar claimed a wicket each. \nIsrael bombed central Beirut in the early hours of Thursday, killing at least six people, after its forces suffered their deadliest day on the Lebanese front in a year of clashes against Iran-backed armed group Hezbollah.Israel said it conducted a precise air strike on Beirut. Reuters witnesses reported hearing a massive blast, and a security source said it targeted a building in central Beirut’s Bachoura neighbourhood close to parliament, the nearest Israeli strikes have come to Lebanon’s seat of government.At least six people were killed and seven wounded, Lebanese health officials said. A photo being circulated on Lebanese WhatsApp groups, which Reuters could not immediately verify, showed a heavily damaged building with its first floor on fire.Three missiles also hit the southern suburb of Dahiyeh, where Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed last week, and loud explosions were heard, Lebanese security officials said. The southern suburbs came under more than a dozen Israeli strikes on Wednesday.A day after Iran fired more than 180 missiles into Israel, Israel said on Wednesday eight soldiers were killed in ground combat in south Lebanon as its forces thrust into its northern neighbour.The Israeli military said regular infantry and armoured units joined its ground operations in Lebanon on Wednesday as Iran’s missile attack and Israel’s promise of retaliation raised concerns that the oil-producing Middle East could be caught up in a wider conflict.Hezbollah said its fighters engaged Israeli forces inside Lebanon. The movement reported ground clashes for the first time since Israeli forces pushed over the border on Monday. Hezbollah said it had destroyed three Israeli Merkava tanks with rockets near the border town of Maroun El Ras.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in a condolence video, said: “We are at the height of a difficult war against Iran’s Axis of Evil, which wants to destroy us.“This will not happen because we will stand together and with God’s help, we will win together,” he said.Lebanon’s health ministry said Israeli air raids killed at least 46 people in the south and centre of the country over the past 24 hours.Iran said on Wednesday its missile volley - its biggest ever assault on Israel - was over barring further provocation, but Israel and the United States promised to hit back hard.U.S. President Joe Biden said he would not support any Israeli strike on Iran’s nuclear sites in response to its ballistic missile attack and urged Israel to act “proportionally” against its regional arch-foe.Biden joined a call with Group of Seven major power leaders on Wednesday to coordinate a response, including new sanctions against Tehran, the White House said.G7 leaders voiced “strong concern” over the Middle East crisis but said a diplomatic solution was still viable and a region-wide conflict was in no one’s interest, a statement said.Hezbollah said it repelled Israeli forces near several border towns and also fired rockets at military posts inside Israel.The paramilitary group’s media chief Mohammad Afif said those battles were only “the first round” and that Hezbollah had enough fighters, weapons and ammunition to push back Israel.Israel’s addition of infantry and armoured troops from the 36th Division, including the Golani Brigade, the 188th Armoured Brigade and 6th Infantry Brigade, suggested that the operation might expand beyond limited commando raids.The military has said its incursion is largely aimed at destroying tunnels and other infrastructure on the border and there were no plans for a wider operation targeting the Lebanese capital Beirut to the north or major cities in the south.1.2 MILLION LEBANESE DISPLACEDNevertheless, it issued new evacuation orders for around two dozen towns along the southern border, instructing inhabitants to head north of the Awali River, which flows east to west some 60 km (37 miles) north of the Israeli frontier.More than 1,900 people have been killed and over 9,000 wounded in Lebanon in almost a year of cross-border fighting, with most of the deaths occurring in the past two weeks, according to Lebanese government statistics.Caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati said that about 1.2 million Lebanese had been displaced by Israeli attacks.Malika Joumaa, from Sudan, was forced to take shelter in Saint Joseph’s church in Beirut after being forced from her house near Sidon in coastal south Lebanon with her husband and two children.“It’s good that the church offered its help. We were going to stay in the streets; where would we have gone?”Iran described Tuesday’s missile assault as a response to Israeli killings of militant leaders, including Nasrallah, attacks in Lebanon against the group and Israel’s war against Palestinian Hamas militants in Gaza.There were no casualties from the missile onslaught in Israel, but one person was killed in the occupied West Bank. \nLiberal Democratic Party President Shigeru Ishiba was designated the new prime minister Tuesday afternoon at plenary sessions of both houses in an extraordinary Diet session that was convened on the day.The new Cabinet was launched on Tuesday night after the investiture ceremony for Ishiba and the attestation ceremony for newly appointed ministers at the Imperial Palace.Ishiba held a press conference that night to explain his administration’s basic policies and major policy agendas. The new Cabinet will focus its efforts on restoration and reconstruction in the areas affected by the Noto Peninsula Earthquake and the vitalization of local economies, among other issues.At the press conference, Ishiba announced to dissolve the House of Representatives on Oct. 9 and hold a lower house election with the official start of the campaign on Oct. 15 and the voting and ballot counting on Oct. 27.“I will speak the truth to the people with courage and sincerity. I will conduct my politics with humility, sincerity and warmth,” he said.- In association with Asia News Network \nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nWhat animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. \nNepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) \nFollowing up on my previous piece on \"Chief ministers' insights on federalism\", this article explores the views of Lumbini, Karnali, and Sudurpashchim provinces.At a programme in Lumbini, Chief Minister Chet Narayan Acharya highlighted a major concern: The 26 percent reduction in the fiscal equalisation grant. Despite repeated requests, the federal government has not adequately addressed this issue, causing significant financial strain on the province. The constitutional right of provinces to fiscal transfers has been compromised, particularly due to delays and reductions in equalisation grants and the haphazard allocation of conditional grants.Since the implementation of federalism, Lumbini has seen considerable development. Acharya emphasised that while the federal government should devolve constitutional powers to the provinces, the provinces must also allow local governments to independently carry out their functions.However, despite these constitutional rights, some problems persist. For instance, the federal government retains the authority to initiate legal actions against civil servants, even though these officials are expected to serve under provincial and local jurisdictions. This creates friction between different levels of government. Additionally, the federal government has not allowed the provinces to manage the police security force.The chief minister highlighted Lumbini's development achievements, noting that the province has nearly doubled its road network from 11,000 to 22,000 kilometres, proving it a key contributor to national progress. Lumbini's focus on capital expenditure contrasts with the increasing current expenditures at the federal and local levels.In Karnali, Chief Minister Yam Lal Kandel acknowledged the difficulties of federal governance but pointed to the significant progress made over the past seven years. He emphasised that party-based politics heavily influences institutional actions, yet Karnali has shown tangible advancements. Kandel stressed that the time has come to focus on policy implementation rather than public opinion. Learning from past experiences and addressing problems head-on should be the priority.Kandel voiced concerns about centralised thinking persisting even within a federal system. He urged caution in rushing constitutional amendments that might create chaos. Fiscal distribution to the provincial government remains imbalanced, requiring adjustments to ensure fairness and equity.Governance problems, including officials' reluctance to serve in remote areas and political interference in administrative matters, further complicate the implementation of federalism. Despite these challenges, Kandel firmly believes that strengthening the federal governance system through meaningful reforms and transparent governance is essential.Sudurpashchim’s Chief Minister, Kamal Bahadur Shah, reflected on both his province's progress and challenges. He mentioned a 17-point proposal the province submitted last year to the National Coordination Council meeting, outlining key issues, such as fiscal distribution and project selection imbalances, requiring federal leadership’s attention.A notable achievement for Sudurpashchim has been the passage of the Civil Service Law, though inconsistencies between federal and provincial interpretations remain. For example, the federal government insists on appointing 12th-grade level officials as provincial secretaries, while the province prefers 11th-level officials. These discrepancies hinder the smooth implementation of federalism. Chief Minister Shah emphasised the need to address core issues like fiscal distribution and project selection, which are crucial for making federalism work for people. While Sudurpashchim has made significant strides, Shah remains optimistic. He believes that with continued dialogue and collaboration, the province can overcome remaining challenges and ensure that federalism not only survives but thrives in Nepal.The interaction programmes conducted by the Federalism & Localisation Centre also included other vital participants such as ministers, speakers, deputy speakers, provincial assembly members, local government chiefs and deputy chiefs, political party leaders, civil servants and civil society members. They reviewed the successes and challenges of the federal governance system, including provincial governments. They emphasised that while preserving the achievements gained through long struggles and sacrifices, the government must build trust in the federal system. This should be accompanied by reforms that ensure justice, equality, good governance and sustainable development. Although there are many questions about the federal government system, stakeholders from all seven provinces have stressed the need to strengthen the system through necessary improvements.There are growing concerns among citizens regarding the federal governance system, particularly the provinces. Political parties do not seem serious about the implementation of federalism. Provinces have been deprived of the constitutional rights granted to them. They lack the authority to exercise control over the police and do not have administrative control over their own staff. Chief ministers are unable to fully exercise their power and must seek approval from central leaders even for small decisions. The provincial structures of political parties are also not aligned with the federal system, as central leaders do not allow provincial party committees to exercise their authority.Local governments in Nepal have been well-organised and effective in exerting pressure on the federal and provincial governments. A notable example occurred when the federal government reduced the fiscal equalisation grant by 26 percent for both provinces and local levels. Local government associations strongly opposed this decision and applied significant pressure, which led to the reinstatement of the grant at the local level. However, the federal government did not release the funds to the provinces, and the provincial grant for FY 2024-25 has decreased compared to FY 2018-19 despite a 550 billion rupee increase in the federal budget. Additionally, several bills infringing on provincial and local governments’ rights have been introduced in the federal parliament. During my tenure as a Member of Parliament, I opposed many of these bills, which aimed to infringe on the rights of the provinces and local levels through legislation. This ongoing centralisation threatens the federal system and undermines the authority of subnational governments.Lobbying within the federal parliament and among political parties is essential to protecting provincial and local rights and promoting the successful practices of subnational governments. However, provincial leaders have struggled to effectively organise themselves against federal overreach because they fear antagonising central leadership.In response to these challenges, I coordinated the establishment of the Federalism & Localisation Centre, a think tank created just over a month ago in consultation with the provinces and political party leaders, particularly those who are sincere and committed to federalism and subnational governments.The think tank conducts research and legislative activities (including post-legislative scrutiny) and fosters intergovernmental relations by coordinating efforts with federal units. The centre brings together representatives from all major political parties in Nepal and experts from various disciplines, aiming to strengthen federalism, democracy and inclusion in the country. Again, reflecting on the interaction programmes: From Koshi's advocacy for equitable resource sharing to Madhesh's call for stronger political commitment to federalism, Bagmati's concerns over police integration, Gandaki’s push for land acquisition, Lumbini’s focus on infrastructure growth, Karnali’s commitment to transparent governance and Sudurpashchim’s emphasis on civil service reforms—each province has demonstrated a solid commitment to making federalism work. The provinces stress the need for consistent action from the federal government and leadership from political parties to truly institutionalise the federal system.The path forward lies in meaningful reforms, clearer constitutional guidelines and greater cooperation between all levels of government. By addressing these challenges, empowering provinces and delivering tangible benefits to its citizens, Nepal can strengthen its federal system. Federalism in Nepal is still evolving, but with sustained effort, it has the potential to transform governance and development across the country. \nThe history of Nepalis serving in foreign armies dates back more than 200 years, primarily focused on recruitment into the British and Indian militaries. However, the participation of Nepalis in the Russian army is a recent phenomenon. It emerged in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine war that began in February 2022. By May 2023, reports surfaced that Nepalis were being recruited to fight for Russia despite the absence of any formal agreements between the two countries. This recruitment has exposed several Nepalis to grave risks and resulted in tragic loss of lives.Unconfirmed reports suggest that 600 to 1,000 Nepalis have joined the Russian military. Many of these individuals arrived in Russia on student or tourist visas, facilitated by human traffickers who promised lucrative jobs in the Russian armed forces. These traffickers reportedly charge between $1,500 to $2,500 per person in the name of providing such opportunities.Nepal’s law prohibits its citizens from joining foreign militaries, except in cases involving long-standing treaties with India and the United Kingdom. Nevertheless, the allure of a stable income in a foreign land has driven many in Nepal, often from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, to walk on this dangerous path. While the Government of Nepal has arrested some of those involved in trafficking, the efforts to control this illicit activity remain inadequate.The plight of Nepali soldiers in the Russian army is a stark reminder of the dangers of being drawn into a foreign conflict. Media reports indicate that around 40 Nepalis have died in the conflict with Ukraine, with many others missing or captured as prisoners of war. A significant factor contributing to these casualties is the inadequate training these individuals received before being deployed to the front lines. Their lack of combat experience, coupled with minimal proficiency in the Russian language, put them at extreme risk. This loss has caused outrage in Nepal, with growing calls for the Russian government to halt its recruitment efforts and repatriate the bodies of those killed. In response to the outcry from Nepal, diplomatic efforts were initiated to address the recruitment issue. The government of Nepal has been in regular communication with Russian authorities to facilitate the safe return of its citizens. Diplomatic channels have been used to negotiate compensation for the families of the deceased or those who were injured in the war. However, there remains limited information on the compensation these families might receive. They are anticipated to receive approximately $150,000, while those injured may receive about $33,000. Nonetheless, these compensations cannot truly alleviate the families’ pain and suffering if they materialise.The underlying cause driving Nepalis to risk their lives in foreign armies is ingrained in Nepal's economic struggles. The country's persistent unemployment problem, exacerbated by ineffective government policies, has left its youth with few opportunities for gainful employment. Agriculture has become unattractive for many due to rising production costs and stagnant market prices. Consequently, a significant portion of Nepal's youth has turned away from farming and is opting for foreign employment.In 2023, over 741,000 Nepalese citizens, including 661,000 men and 80,000 women, left the country searching for work. The Terai region, in particular, has seen a mass exodus, with the Dhanusha district sending the largest number of workers abroad, followed by Jhapa, Morang, Siraha and Mahottari. Traditionally reliant on agricultural employment, these districts have been unable to offer viable livelihoods to their residents, forcing many to seek jobs in countries like Malaysia, the Gulf States, and others.A few decades ago, the primary destination for Nepali migrant workers was India, particularly the states of Haryana, Punjab and Delhi. However, labour migration has shifted towards other global markets in recent years as Nepalis seek better wages and working conditions in more distant lands.Nepal is not alone paying the price in the Russian-Ukraine war. Reports indicate that Indian citizens have also been recruited into the Russian military, facing similar hardships and casualties. The Indian government, like Nepal, has been in talks with Russian officials to secure the release and safe return of its citizens. The plight of these soldiers has drawn attention to the broader issue of economic migration in South Asia, where large populations are forced to leave their home countries due to a lack of opportunities.In Nepal, family members of those recruited into the Russian army have staged hunger strikes, frustrated by what they perceive as insufficient government action to stop the recruitment. They also submitted an 11-point memorandum to former Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane, demanding the safe rescue of their loved ones serving in the Russian army, as well as financial relief for the families of those killed in the war. These protests highlight the desperate situation faced by both the soldiers and their families, who feel abandoned by the state.The case of Nepali citizens joining the Russian army is a tragic consequence of a much larger problem: The government's failure to provide adequate employment opportunities at home. Driven by poverty and desperation, young Nepali men and women are forced to take extreme measures, including risking their lives in foreign conflicts. The situation exposes the inadequacies of Nepal's planning and policies, which have been unable to address the root causes of migration or create sustainable livelihoods for its citizens.The government's response, though belated, has included diplomatic engagement and promises of compensation. However, this is not enough to reverse the tide of migration or to prevent future tragedies. Nepal must urgently address its unemployment crisis, particularly in the agricultural sector, which has historically been a source of employment for the majority of its population. If the youth continue to abandon their homeland in search of work, the future of Nepal's economy, and its social fabric, appears bleak. \nAccording to police reports, by Monday evening, the freak monsoon downpour and the resultant flooding and mudslides over the weekend have claimed over 200 lives. About 127 people have been injured, and 56 are still missing. The government claims that some 4,022 stranded people on the damaged highways and flooded zones across Nepal have been successfully rescued. There are no official figures on the loss of lives and properties in the Kathmandu Valley and beyond.Yet, every patch of dark cloud in the sky seems ominous. Weather experts have warned of more heavy rains in the coming days. However, what is most worrying is the government's lack of preparedness. Returning from the UN General Assembly Meeting in the United States on Monday, Prime Minister Khadka Prasad Sharma Oli said that he hadn’t even imagined this level of flooding in Kathmandu.A national disaster People call this a natural disaster; I’d rather call it a national disaster of epic proportions. The government, led by a coalition of the two largest parties—the Nepali Congress and the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist Leninist)—miserably failed to not only protect people’s lives but also, according to its admission, to coordinate the resources and manpower to save them. Even Balen Shah, the Mayor of Kathmandu Metropolitan City, who has made quite a name for himself by doing some remarkable works in the capital city, failed to mobilise his offices. He announced the dispatch of 300 city police personnel only after the river systems here had flooded tremendously and claimed some lives. How pathetic!True, he may not be able to do much in such an unplanned and unmanaged capital town. He has done his best to destroy some illegal constructions and somehow restore the old glory. Shah has also displayed his zeal for discovering and reviving, albeit with limited success, some traditional river systems that have been legally or illegally buried under the concrete for centuries. In this effort, the mayor has fought with many parties and the traditional court systems. Yet, this time, the charismatic mayor had no substantial disaster management plans. Some members of the political parties, including those from the opposition, the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre), volunteered to search and rescue people buried alive in the mud. I wish more people were deployed by parties and other organisations to serve the needy in the affected areas. But this is not enough. It’s time all parties, big and small, took the issue of natural disasters more seriously. It’s important to revitalise the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority, appoint exporters and allocate more resources instead of merely using them as a tool to appease party workers. To achieve this and other vital things, there must be a robust debate in the Parliament, including in state legislatures, about how best to tackle the recurring problem of landslides and flooding. They should get the help of experts in the area and international experts to design policies and programmes for preventing and swiftly dealing with natural catastrophes. What we’ve just witnessed has been a national disgrace. Even the vehicles and people buried in Jhyaple Khola—very close to Kathmandu and next to the starting point of the near-complete underground tunnel system built by Japan—were dug out of the mud after many hours. What took so long? Good use of helicopters?We may be too poor to own an airforce; defence-wise, it’s not essential either. However, the least the government could do is engage dedicated army helicopters in disaster management. Importantly, as some retired police officers have publicly stressed, it’s time the Nepal Police had its own helicopters suitable for swift action, at least for the aid of communities nestled in remote hills and mountains. If parties are serious about this problem, they should stop using government helicopters to carry leaders to every nook and corner of the country—especially for partisan events. If they want to use them, they should pay separately. There must be a strict check and balance on this matter. This way, much of the resources wasted in the service of big or influential leaders could be channelled to people badly hit by floods and landslides. The language of disasterOn Monday, in an article in Setopati, veteran journalist and writer Narayan Wagle claimed that we have never tried to understand the “language” of disasters. He says that every natural disaster, including the big 2015 Gorkha Earthquakes, makes a statement, but neither the government nor people understand its meaning. He blamed mainly the journalists for their persistent enthusiasm to report the quantities of deaths and injuries but little interest in debating possible ways to minimise the harm. I agree with Wagle: We all need to do some serious soul-searching about our attitude to natural calamities and their deadly impacts. Only when we, the members of civil society, are sensitive to the issue can we hold the government accountable. Needless to say, much of our civil society is linked to political parties and national and international non-government organisations. The ruling CPN (UML) boasts the largest number of members who either run or work for NGOs and INGOs. These bodies also have more resources and, in some cases, expertise. Working with the government at all levels through party channels, they could and should play a vital role in raising sensitivities towards the problem of disaster management.Disaster prevention and management is one of the few areas which is relatively non-political and uncontroversial. Parties on the left, right or centre wouldn’t object to the policies and programmes for disaster mitigation and management. And, of course, foreign government and non-government agencies would readily offer a hand with financial resources and expertise. I’m pretty certain that all donors would be willing to help the Nepal Police and Nepal Army with a few light helicopters useful for search and rescue after natural calamities.  \nOn April 26, 2024, sidhakura.com, an online portal, disseminated a series of malicious audio-video content involving the chairs of two media houses. The fake content even dragged the Supreme Court, citing that the two chairs had met incumbent and former SC justices and senior advocates to dismiss over 400 corruption court cases. When the misleading content spread, the judicial body immediately responded, launching a suo moto contempt of court case against the portal’s publisher and editor. After months of investigation, the court on Sunday issued a final verdict and showed the prison’s door to the guilty. In addition to the portal’s publisher and editor, who got a prison sentence of three months each, another person, who supposedly conducted the infamous ‘sting operation’ on the portal’s behalf got six months in jail. Such harsh sentencing was due, and it gives a clear message that anyone who peddles false news in the name of journalism will be severely punished. The timely verdict also draws a clear line between free speech and disinformation and misinformation. The online portal’s claims were based on false premises and ambiguities. First, without any regard for media ethics, the editor and the publisher sensationalised the content, relying on an unverified audio clip provided by a third party. Second, when the Supreme Court and Press Council Nepal summoned them to be present at the court with evidence to substantiate their reports, they failed to do so. The sidhakura content unfortunately represents one of many cases of fake news that have surfaced in Nepal with the advent of new forms of technology, which in turn undermines democracy and the rule of law. Whether on social media platforms or traditional media outlets, disinformation intended to mislead people and misinformation with outright lies have become all too common. The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) has escalated the problem with the help of deepfakes—audio recordings, video clips or images replicating someone else’s identity using AI tools to spread false information. Deepfakes have been used not only to damage reputations but also to ‘report’ on events that are impossible in real life. In the recent tragic flooding and other natural disasters, deepfake videos simulating various kinds of calamities have been circulated, either to get views and likes or to spread fear. Fake news and deepfakes have also affected elections in many countries this year.Nepal’s Electronic Transaction Act, the umbrella law covering such cases, is limited in scope, primarily focused on traditional forms of crimes like digital fraud and identity theft. It doesn’t address emerging threats brought about by artificial intelligence. A new law to incorporate these has thus become vital. As important is sensitising people about the consequences of defaming other people through news outlets or social media platforms. The precedent set by Sunday’s ruling will help. While the media must be free to investigate and report on sensitive issues, this freedom cannot be misused to spread baseless rumours. Sunday’s verdict can be a good place to start the much-needed conversation on the regulation of various kinds of media. This debate will have to be extensive and nuanced as it is so easy to err in this case, either on the side of too much caution or too much liberty. \nOn Saturday, massive rains left at least 64 people dead and countless more injured. It uprooted people from their homes and left thousands without phone lines and electricity. Economic damages alone were estimated at between $95 billion and $100 billion. Local disaster responders said that given the scale of the event, some deaths and destruction were inevitable, even with the best of preparations. The trail of devastation that Hurricane Helene has left in its wake in the southeastern United States is the worst in decades. On the same day, halfway across the world in Nepal, incessant rains and floods and landslides killed at least 170, injured another 100, while 68 went missing. In Kathmandu Valley alone, 37 people perished in the heaviest rains the valley has seen in 54 years. Police personnel and rescue workers were digging up debris in multiple locations in the country, in the fear that more people might be buried. Both in the southeastern US seaboard and Nepal, Saturday’s water-induced disasters can be attributed to unpredictable weather. Yet, at least in Nepal’s case, climate change is only a part of a much larger story of neglect.Saturday’s tragedy in Nepal represents an egregious failure of the Nepali state to keep its citizens safe. Days in advance, the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology had been putting out reminders that the country was in for unprecedented rains. The message was endlessly broadcast through media platforms as well as each and every cell phone. Yet, when the tragedy struck, responsible government agencies seemed completely unprepared. Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak made a mockery of himself when he attributed the government’s failure to save four people who were stranded on their roof in Nakhu of Lalitpur to ‘poor visibility’ as a result of which choppers, supposedly, could not reach them. But then a good samaritan, Chaniklal Tamang, managed to rescue two of them by diving into the swollen Nakhu River. There could not be a better sign of the Nepali state’s incompetence. Not just incompetence though. The casual way high-ranking government officials like Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, Deputy Prime Minister Prakash Man Singh and Home Minister Lekhak have responded to queries over the government’s handling of the crisis shows an utter disregard for the lives of common folks. It was also galling that the police and army personnel deployed for rescue efforts, be it in Kathmandu or Dhading, reported having to work without basic equipment like raft jackets and rescue ropes. This suggests that even though water-induced disasters claim thousands of lives every year in Nepal, disaster preparedness and response have never been the state’s priority. It is easy to see why. Those in leadership positions in the government are too busy scheming to prolong their stay in power—when not working for various vested interests. Except during election time, seldom do they spend any time listening to people’s concerns. The country’s prime minister sending back from New York his smiling pictures with VVIPs while his country struggled with a national tragedy was not just a matter of poor optics and iffy judgment. In the eyes of the Nepali people, it was also an indication of his misplaced priorities. \nFrom 1977 to 2007, in the process of expanding the Shuklaphanta Wildlife Reserve, now a national park in Sudurpaschim Province, thousands of families were displaced. The Ministry of Forest and Environment rehabilitated 5,200 families in camps inside the park, quite close to the wildlife. Citing safety concerns, over the past 22 years, hundreds of families have sought a way out of the national park. Yet they don’t know where to go or what to do next. Shuklaphanta is an example of a recurring national problem. Every year, disasters, both natural and manmade, leave thousands of Nepali families without proper shelters. Seldom has the state taken an initiative for their quick and proper rehabilitation. What’s at stake is the security and well-being of the displaced people. Temporary shelters and settlement areas are not as protective as permanent ones, leaving those displaced from Shuklaphanta vulnerable to the attacks of wild animals and other natural calamities. Dealing with wild animals in the national park has become a daily struggle. And their settlement in the conservation area has also proved detrimental to wildlife. Following last year’s Jajarkot earthquake, hundreds of families had to put up in temporary huts. Come monsoon, things only got worse, holed up as they were in their leaky tents. Lest we forget, during winter, many earthquake victims died due to cold. Pretty much the same could now be true in the case of those displaced by the wildlife reserve. Over the years, multiple judicial commissions—33 in total—have been formed in Sudurpaschim province to address the Shuklaphanta rehabilitation issue. Yet none has done anything substantive other than count the number of displaced families—1,480 of them. But a coordinator for the displaced families claims the number is 2,473, accusing the commission of deliberately downplaying the number of the displaced. Similar inefficiencies plague disaster rehabilitation efforts across the country. Discrepancies in government records and actual numbers often result in relief materials either failing to reach the needy or piling up unused. As concerning is the disappearance of funds meant for rehabilitation programmes. Even after the 2015 earthquake, many donor agencies were concerned that corruption would hamper rebuilding—and it did. The 30th commission in Shuklaphanta proposed to provide each displaced family with 0.338 hectares of land or Rs6 million in compensation. But that recommendation was never seriously considered. As a result, the victims have long lost faith in these commissions. It is thus vital that any new initiative be taken only after gaining the victims’ trust. Rehabilitation of course isn’t something that can be done in haste. It takes time and thought-out measures. Yet proper rehabilitation is seldom the state’s priority, as those in the government prefer to try out much easier temporary fixes rather than rigorously work on the same issue for months or even years on end. The displaced individuals, who are already mentally and physically traumatised, shouldn’t have to suffer more. Each and every Nepali has the constitutional right to live with dignity and it is the state’s responsibility to ensure the same. Really, a government that is incapable of looking after its weak and vulnerable people does not deserve to be called democratic.  \nNepal’s economy that has been facing one after another setbacks since the 2015 earthquake has been struggling to bounce back. Last week, two international agencies—the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB)—announced that Nepal’s economy was poised to improve in the upcoming fiscal year. In this context, the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Nara Bahadur Thapa, former executive director of the research department of Nepal Rastra Bank, to discuss the current state of the national economy. The ADB, in its report last week, anticipated Nepal’s economy to grow by 4.9 percent this fiscal. A few days earlier, a visiting IMF team also painted an improving picture of Nepal’s economy. How do you see these projections?Nepal’s economic growth in the past 2-3 years has remained below 5 percent. But successive governments in their fiscal budgets have been setting the target of 6 to 7 percent growth. Also, the budget this year has aimed for 6 percent growth. In the meantime, two donor agencies have painted an improving picture of our economy. The ADB has anticipated 4.9 percent growth. Also, the IMF’s team that visited Nepal on a fact finding mission has projected better prospects. They expected better yield from the agriculture sector as Nepal is witnessing more rains. Last year, the growth of agriculture was 3 percent. Now they expect the sector may grow by 3.5 to 4 percent and that may lift overall growth. They have cited improvement in tourism and increased energy export as other bases. Based on these grounds, the ADB has projected 4.9 percent economic growth. But even the target of 5 percent growth looks ambitious if you analyse economic data available as of now and the steps taken by government agencies. We have witnessed more rain but that doesn’t always do us good. More rain in the late monsoon often damages paddy at the time of harvest. Second, the heavy monsoon has caused huge losses in our infrastructure such as roads and bridges that are vital to keep the daily lives and trade running. This may impact potential economic growth as some vital highways and roads have been badly damaged. These factors may pose a challenge in achieving the targets set by the government and donor agencies. Another important factor is that the ratio of capital formation to GDP [gross domestic product] is consistently decreasing. It was 33.8 in the fiscal year 2018-19, it decreased to 30.5 in 2019-20, to 29.3 in 2020-21, 29.0 in 2021-22, 25.1 in 2022-23 and 24.5 in 2023-24. How can we expect economic growth when capital formation keeps decreasing. We can’t achieve 6 percent growth without first improving the situation of capital formation. Capital formation in the private sector is on a decline and the government hasn’t been able to boost it. On the other hand, capital expenditure was lower in the past fiscal year in comparison to the previous fiscal. There is no strong sign of increasing capital formation even in the coming year. This is because the government has failed to collect revenue as per its own target. The revenue collection ratio is falling. It has come down to 18 percent of GDP, from 22 percent not so long ago. With this, the government’s funding capacity is continuously declining. It has failed even to fulfil its own duties. For instance, it hasn’t been able to pay health insurance bills and or the contractors. Similarly, credit offtake from private banks to the private sector has not increased from 6 percent. It used to be around 15-16 percent. Also, no substantive initiatives have been taken to improve productivity. For this, government agencies have to cut red tape. The private sector isn’t optimistic. We are talking a lot but not working seriously to lay a strong ground for growth.What are the signs that private investors are pessimistic?There is enough liquidity in the banks, and the interest rate is decreasing, but the private sector is not borrowing. Bankers say there is no demand from the sector. This indicates pessimism. None of the big business houses have launched any big projects in recent times. The government talks a lot about the energy sector but it is not doing power purchase agreements (PPAs) with hydropower project developers. We aren’t doing enough to realise the goal of exporting 10,000MW electricity to India. This shows no serious effort is being made to initiate reforms. The capital market has required some urgent reforms. But the government hasn’t appointed office bearers in the regulatory body for the past seven months. The government hasn’t given permission to issue IPOs and FPOs. Hence, the government is keeping two important sectors—energy and capital market—on hold. All these trends and activities suggest it will be a challenge to achieve even moderate economic growth.You pointed to the policy hurdles but the multilateral agencies have hailed the government for policy reforms. The IMF in its statement has welcomed recent amendments to various laws and the ADB has welcomed “the cautiously accommodative monetary policy”. Don’t these statements reflect reality?While making their positions public, the international agencies follow certain norms and criteria. First, they take macro pictures such as the government’s commitments. They take the pledges made by the government in the investment summit seriously. They think the commitments will be implemented. Second, they don’t want to irk the host country by presenting a bleak picture because they are diplomats. They point out possible pitfalls during bilateral and table talks but present themselves diplomatically while making their official statements public.Remittance, tourism and energy export are taken as major bases for economic growth but all three depend on external factors. How reliable can the projection be?Without trading and increasing exports, we can’t progress economically. We need to export to increase production and create jobs. Export is an engine of economic growth. Anyhow, we must increase exports. About your query, the government should tackle such things by strengthening relations with the countries concerned and devise policies and strategies accordingly.Our economy is increasingly dependent on remittance. How risky is it in the long run?Remittance has become a boon for our economy. It has played a tremendous role in poverty reduction. The first Nepal Living Standard Survey (NLSS) conducted by the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS)—now the National Statistics Office—in 1995-96 showed 42 percent Nepali population living below the poverty line. The latest [fourth] living standard survey has shown the poverty level at 20 percent. It wouldn’t be possible without remittance. Therefore, we can’t undermine the role of remittance in this social transformation. Were not the government’s plans and policies responsible for this achievement?The government role would not have been enough. What government policies have created jobs in Nepal? Are there any schemes worth mentioning? The industrialisation hasn’t increased. It is the industrial sector that creates jobs but the share of the manufacturing sector has come down to 4.87 percent in total GDP. Some years ago, it was nearly 9-10 percent. It shows our economy is being deindustrialised. How can we reduce poverty without providing jobs to the youths? Thus, foreign employment played a vital role in poverty reduction. Second is the role of remittance in maintaining foreign exchange reserves, which is essential to buy things from abroad. We have sufficient foreign exchange reserves because of remittance.Information Technology is now projected as a promising sector in creating jobs and transforming Nepal’s economy. How realistic is this expectation?Four fields can be taken as promising sectors in Nepal—agriculture, tourism, IT and hydropower. The IT sector certainly has a bright future. As our country is land-locked, we have additional challenges in merchandise exports and we can’t be competitive. The IT sector won’t have that barrier so it can be competitive in the international market. But for that the government has to formulate IT-friendly policies. For instance, if a Kathmandu-based Nepali firm wants to sell services in the US, Europe or any other international market, they need liaison offices in those countries. Otherwise, they can’t be competitive and grow. But the government doesn’t provide foreign exchange for them to expand their business abroad.Without this policy reform, Nepalis can’t compete with IT companies from other countries. Similarly, foreign companies need to come and work here so that Nepali youths can learn from them. Foreign banks came to Nepal and Nepali bankers learned. Now Nepali banks are doing good. But our policies aren’t favourable for foreigners interested in setting up IT firms. Also, well-trained IT workers are in shortage. We are progressing but we have to put in extra effort to make transformative changes in this sector.The cooperatives’ scam has emerged as a serious issue. What impact may it cause in the national economy if it’s not resolved soon?The cooperative sector played a vital role in creating financial inclusion in our economy by making 7.3 million people its members. Those who couldn’t do their regular transactions with banks were engaged with cooperatives. If that sector collapses, our state of financial inclusion will decline too. Second, they were major financiers for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME). Cooperatives are directly linked to entrepreneurship through MSMEs. They played a role in making interest rates of banks more competitive as well as banks and financial institutions were under pressure by the interest rates offered by cooperatives. Now they won’t feel the pressure.In this context, many people may resort to informal transactions. According to the 16th periodic plan, nearly 50 percent of Nepal’s economy is informal. We are under pressure to reduce the portion of the informal economy. But the crisis in the cooperative sector may increase the informal economy as those who were involved in cooperatives, which is a formal sector, are likely to do informal transactions with traders or other individuals.Cooperatives are not well regulated and there are anomalies but they are registered in a government agency, pay taxes, have offices and a record system. They brought people in far-flung villages under a formal channel. If the depositors resort to individual transactions, their money will be unsafe. The constitution accepted them as one of the three pillars—along with the government and the private sector—of the country’s economy. The sector expanded its network where there were no economic activities from the government and private sectors. For instance, the government was providing certain services such as distributing fertilisers, crop seeds, sugar through cooperatives. People will now be deprived of these services. Also, the commercial banks might face complications due to the domino effect of the cooperative scam. For instance, if the government seizes the land put up by a cooperative as a collateral in a bank and sells it to return the deposits, the bank might be in trouble.It is also said that cooperatives were becoming platforms for money laundering. How serious was the problem?Cooperatives didn’t seek a source of money from the depositors while accepting big deposits. They weren’t affiliated to the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of the central bank and the Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT). Therefore, there is a problem of money laundering. It can be resolved when they get affiliated with the FIU.What initiatives should be taken to address the problems seen in the cooperative sector?A powerful regulatory authority should be established without delay. The authority should work as a dedicated agency to clear the mess. Then, AML/CFT provisions should be implemented, a credit information centre should be set up and a debt recovery tribunal formed, and deposits guaranteed. The concept of self-regulation isn’t enough. These financial infrastructures are essential. \nThe parliamentary special probe committee formed to investigate cooperatives scam submitted its report last week. The government has already started implementing the report. In this context, Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with the committee chair Surya Thapa for more insights on the probe’s findings and the anomalies in the cooperative sector they saw during the investigation.After your committee submitted the report on cooperatives scam, people have interpreted its findings in different ways. Why the confusion?Our committee prepared, finalised and endorsed the report unanimously. No member registered any dissent. This is an important point. However, people have interpreted its findings a bit differently. The supporters of [Rastriya Swatantra Party chair] Rabi Lamichhane have tried to make it appear like the report has given him a clean chit. They have selectively taken a certain portion of the report which states that Lamichhane’s involvement couldn’t be formally established in the process of transferring funds from cooperatives to the Gorkha Media Network. But a huge amount of money has been provided to the Gorkha Media Network from various cooperatives against the Cooperative Act 2017, which prohibits investment of cooperative deposits to any company. It is seen that Lamichhane is directly involved in spending the funds collected from the cooperatives. Based on that, we have found chair of the media company Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai, the then managing director Rabi Lamichhane, directors Chhabilal Joshi and Kumar Ramtel directly responsible in the misuse of cooperative funds and have asked the government to take action against them as per the existing laws. The aforementioned two aspects are inextricably linked. We didn’t find any evidence of transfer of cooperative funds to Lamichhane’s personal bank account. It is sent to the bank account of the Gorkha Media Network. The KYC form of the Global IME Bank shows that Lamichhane is one of the three holders of the joint account. Any one of the three can issue cheques from the account. The funds invested as loan in the Gorkha Media Network have been transferred to the joint bank account, from where Lamichhane has released money by signing cheques. This is how Lamichhane is directly involved in embezzlement of the cooperative funds. Many argue that as per the cooperative law only those who release money from the cooperatives are held responsible but not those who spend it after it is received at the company. Is that the case?The Cooperative Act 2017 prohibits releasing any loan to a company. But it is sent to the company, where Lamichhane is an owner with 15 percent share and a managing director. And, the money is misused there. An informal statement of GB Rai shows Rs1.20 billion of cooperative deposits has been invested in the media company while our financial analysis shows the amount is Rs654 million. Evidence shows Rs220 million has been directly sent to the media company’s bank account. Depositors have been deprived of their money. Other staff working at the company aren’t responsible but the owners are. They could be charged with cooperative fraud under the Cooperative Act, fraud and duping under the National Penal Code, organised crime cases under the Organised Crime Prevention Act, and money laundering cases under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. Some individuals involved with various cooperatives including Roshni Gurung of a Butwal-based cooperative told the committee that they deposited millions of rupees in the bank account of a person named Rabi Lamichhane. Kumar Ramtel said the person named Rabi Lamichhane is none other than the Rastriya Swatantra Party chair. Still, the committee couldn’t establish the link. What is the complication?The flow of the money shows the connection but documents to link the transactions are not available. We didn’t find documents with Lamichhane’s signatures and fingerprints that needed to be submitted to get a loan. All the seven cooperatives run by GB Rai were releasing loans without following due procedure. But we have successfully traced the flow of the money. The loan amount created in the name of Rabi Lamichhane in Butwal and deposited by Roshni Gurung had reached the Gorkha Media Network’s bank account which was jointly operated by GB Rai, Rabi Lamichhane and Chhabilal Joshi. This is an established fact. The committee didn’t find any document showing the flow of cooperative money to his personal account. But that alone is insufficient to give him a clean chit as a huge sum has been sent to the media company’s bank account jointly run by three people including Lamichhane. Another sum from the Supreme Cooperative has been deposited to the bank account of Gorkha Media Network. The bank voucher shows Roshni Gurung/Rabi Lamichhane as depositors. The amount also goes to the same joint account.Now the government has forwarded the report to the investigation agencies. Do you think the agencies can unearth the missing documents?Our committee worked in a different way to regular House committees. We followed methods of investigation just like the police investigation agencies and government’s prosecution agencies do. We recorded the suspects’ statements, took their fingerprints, and got the signatures to authenticate their statements. I believe this is a new practice by a Nepali parliamentary committee. Sufficient evidence has already been gathered in the past as well. While carrying out this task and preparing the 1,124-page document, we have followed the norms and procedures of an investigation body.During the interrogation, many suspects told the committee that they knew nothing and shifted the responsibility to GB Rai, who is on the run. Those from seven cooperatives–Hamro Nayakrishi Multipurpose Cooperatives; Swarnalaxmi; Supreme; Suryadarshan; Sahara; Samanata and Sano Paila and the officials from Gorkha Media Network gave such answers. Their common answer is, “I don’t know about this, GB Rai does.” Many of them might have been trying to evade their responsibility by blaming Rai. The government has failed to produce Rai. Won’t this investigation be incomplete in his absence?Based on its facts and evidence, the investigation report is complete. Yes, 29 suspects including GB Rai are at large. They are believed to be staying abroad. Their statements have not been recorded. But that doesn’t make the investigation incomplete. We have accessed the database of Gorkha Media Network and other cooperative organisations, collected important documents and analysed them. There is no confusion about the money embezzled in the scam. We have determined a total of Rs2.58 billion from various cooperatives has been misused by investing in several organisations including the Gorkha Media Network, Nature Nest, Nature Herbs, Gorkha Group of Investment, Gorkha Ayurved Company—49 people were responsible for these investments, including GB Rai. Of that, Rs654 million has been invested in Gorkha Media Network. A total of Rs8 billion has been embezzled in the seven cooperatives where Rai is involved. So the investigation is complete. During the interrogation, some office bearers of cooperatives claimed they had no role in the transactions as they were dummy officials and GB Rai and some individuals Rai trusted did everything. How convincing is that?The practice of creating dummy officials, fake documents, false marriages and divorces etcetera is rampant in the cooperative sector. In the seven cooperatives GB Rai is at the centre. He has at least one key person in each of these seven cooperatives as chair or manager and carries out everything through them. In some of them, the chairpersons know nothing. The cooperatives don’t follow any norms, rules and regulations of cooperatives. They work just on the basis of orders they get from Rai or his trusted individuals over the phone. Rai gets advice from a California-based individual named Gyan Bahadur Bamjan. The Cooperative Act prohibits an individual from being a member of more than one cooperative but Rai is involved in at least seven cooperatives as a chair, secretary, vice-chair or patron.The government has decided to implement the report. How should the state agencies work to bring good results?The government should immediately initiate action against four persons—Rabi Lamichhane, GB Rai, Chhabilal Joshi and Kumar Ramtel—as the report has found them responsible for misusing cooperative funds. We have also determined the roles and responsibilities of around 1,000 individuals who were chair, vice-chairs, secretaries, treasurers, account chiefs or others who in decision making roles in 40 cooperatives we were tasked to investigate. They should be brought under investigation and their properties should be seized so as to create an environment to return the depositors’ money.Different arrangements need to be made about those who are in judicial custody. They should be released, their all documents including passports seized and they should be kept under surveillance and allowed to take initiatives to return the depositors’ money. The government, while unveiling the fiscal budget, had announced to take initiatives to return deposits upto Rs500,000 by keeping cooperatives’ assets as collateral. This process should be expedited. Likewise, the government should set up an all-powerful regulatory authority. At present, all the 753 local governments, seven provincial governments and the federal government have the regulatory role. That is pointless. Now a strong dedicated regulatory authority should be formed. The Crisis-ridden Cooperatives Management Committee is there but it should be made more effective by giving it greater executive powers. When a cooperative is in crisis, the regulatory body should take over its management and fix the crisis just like Nepal Rastra Bank does in the banking sector.What patterns of anomalies did you find in the cooperatives?The fundamental idea of a cooperative is to run by its own members based on self-regulation. But a few board members were found to be using all the authority and misusing the funds while members were unaware about the affairs in the organisations. The board members use most of the resources for their relatives and other closed ones. Annual meetings are organised as picnics and wedding parties. In some cases, annual meetings are fake, audit reports, auditors and signatures, all are fake.In the course of preparing the committee report, I have coined terms like ‘cooperative divorce’ and ‘cooperative marriage’. Divorce and marriage documents are prepared based on the fortune of the cooperatives. There was misappropriation of Rs120 million in a cooperative, where Jyoti Gurung was manager, in 2075 BS. Dhan Raj Gurung, who is Nepali Congress Vice-president, divorced his wife Jyoti in 2076 BS. But, in 2077, Dhan Raj presented himself as a guarantor of a loan to Jyoti. Again in 2080, both of them jointly paid back a loan of Rs9.1 million. This is a bit of a trend in the cooperative sector.Do you think we need to reconsider the basic idea of cooperatives as self-regulated organisations?In the report, we haven’t questioned its principle, need and importance. Cooperative sector is vital for our economy. But the concept of self-regulation as stated in the Cooperative Act 2017 has failed. Now, this sector should be overseen by a strong regulatory body. Still, the idea of self-regulation can be given continuity as the members should be allowed to run the cooperatives on their own but their activities should be strictly regulated by a powerful authority. Moreover, the cooperatives that do big transactions should be regulated by the central bank.Why did the present regulatory bodies fail?There were over 50 lawmakers who proudly identified themselves as office bearers of certain cooperatives. They over-emphasised self-regulation and undermined the role of regulatory bodies. Individuals like GB Rai and other fraudsters benefited from that. Therefore, we recommended stringent laws and a stronger regulatory authority. \nNepal is marking its ninth Constitution Day on Thursday. The country’s two largest parties—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—formed a coalition government a month ago with a commitment to reviewing and amending the constitution. In this context, Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal and Binod Ghimire sat down with constitutional expert Purna Man Shakya to discuss the good and bad aspects of the constitution amendment process.The Congress and the UML have floated a proposal to amend the constitution. Is the time ripe to make changes in our statute?Generally, constitutions are reviewed after around a decade of their implementation. So, we have come to the stage of reviewing whether our constitution has functioned properly. However, the sudden announcement of the amendment is premature, as this is a serious business. In our case, the constitution can’t be amended just based on the interest of one or two parties. It requires a national consensus. There should be an understanding among the political parties represented in Parliament. And, a sort of consensus even among the people’s level is important as there was huge public involvement in making this constitution. Sentiment of various communities must be respected while making any changes in the national charter. What can be the modality of seeking consensus at the people’s level? Should a draft be prepared and opened up for debate?While making changes in the constitution, some issues might be technical and not of interest to common people. But if any changes are made in policy issues that can alter our country’s structural dynamics, the concerned communities must be consulted. Just the present strength of the political parties represented in Parliament is no guarantee that they truly represent people. For instance, the Maoists emerged as the largest party through the election in 2008. But it has been shrunk to a distant third in the House. However, we can’t conclude from this that the people have discarded the party’s agenda. The Maoists might have been discredited due to their activities and failure in delivery but people might still favour the agenda they once championed. Similar is the case with other parties. Therefore, we have to consider broader consensus both in Parliament as well as the people’s level.How challenging is it to enter the constitution amendment process?Any amendment calls for a two-thirds majority in the House of Representatives as well as the National Assembly in the federal parliament. If an issue is linked to provincial authority, it should be endorsed by the majority [four] of seven provinces. So, this is not easy. Therefore, the parties should tread carefully.You mentioned earlier that constitution amendments without a review process is not a right step. Could you elaborate?The right way is to first have broad understanding among the top leaders of political forces on the issues and then constitute a panel of experts to conduct a comprehensive study on that. Such studies are conducted through two methods—doctrinal and non-doctrinal. The doctrinal method analyses related literature and principles on theoretical approach while the non-doctrinal method studies the public sentiments and opinions through surveys and interactions, and comes up with certain methodologies with the help of subject experts. Through such study, the experts identify the issues and recommend the ways to the politicians. This is the right process.There are also arguments that reviewing the constitution without even bringing it into full-fledged implementation is wrong. Based on the practice during these years, we have concluded that certain provisions didn’t work properly. It is true that we are talking about making changes in the constitution without even implementing certain provisions. First we have to give the system an opportunity to work in a full-fledged way. Then, we can evaluate whether it worked. Any move to dissolve the system without properly implementing it will create divisions and invite another conflict. A question that is often asked: Is there a problem with our constitution or with our politicians? People can change the constitution but the constitution can’t change the people. Therefore, a constitution should be developed also on the basis of the nature of people in the country who use it. If our political parties and the politicians had reformed themselves, we might not have had to discuss constitutional changes time and again. We should have made the system strong for more effective checks and balances and made leaders and officials more accountable. The ruling parties reason that the constitution amendment became necessary to ensure political stability.When a federal government is changed, its aftershocks are immediately seen in all seven provincial governments. It directly impacts development and other activities across the country. It’s a flaw in our party system but we have to find a solution in the system. We see people raising voices for two things—stability and retirement of old politicians. As Nepali politicians never retire voluntarily, we have to address it through the system. Direct election of executive head can be one way to address this problem. People have found local governments more effective than federal and provincial governments. It is because chiefs and representatives of local governments are directly elected and they can serve the full five-year term.Once people are given the right to elect heads of government, they won’t elect old faces such as KP Oli, Sher Bahadur Deuba and Prachanda [Pushpa Kamal Dahal], who have been tested multiple times. It will serve two purposes—first, it gives stability and second, it allows popular leaders to emerge in place of the old ones. The old leaders have maintained control over national politics through their huge party organisations. But when people directly elect presidents and chief ministers their grip over party organisations can’t be decisive in national politics. For that we have to amend the constitution.However, again, an expert team needs to thoroughly study the pros and cons of such changes. But what I can say based on the general study of public perception is that we can first go for direct election of executive heads at the provincial level. In the next phase we can go for direct presidential election at the federal level.What went wrong in the practice of the three-tier federal system?While adopting federalism, the basic idea was to allow the local governments to oversee local matters while the provincial governments would handle wide ranges of issues related to agriculture, industry, forest, education and health, etcetera. If the two sub-national governments handle these things, people don’t need to come to the centre seeking solutions to their problems. In such a scenario, the federal government can focus on important affairs such as foreign relations, defence, telecommunication, currency, national infrastructure projects and inter-provincial affairs. Such division of powers would automatically create specialisation in the respective governments.But the federal system is not implemented as per that spirit. Provinces aren’t allowed to exercise their rights. People are still travelling to Kathmandu all the way from remote districts even for basic things. The constitution has mandated the provinces to maintain law and order in their respective provinces but the federal government hasn’t allowed them to have their own police forces. Provinces without police have become like administrative units. The centre has a huge bureaucracy in Kathmandu. It is high time that the centre delegates authority to provinces as per the constitutional spirit. Federal lawmakers have huge interest in local development activities because it is directly related to their election. They don’t want to lose this influence. The interest of federal lawmakers however contradicts with the constitution.There is also a belief that the local level has authority in areas where they can’t work effectively, for instance they are mandated to oversee the education system up to grade 12 while provinces don’t have much role. Do you think such jurisdictional matters need to be reviewed and provinces should be given more authority?That’s right. First of all, we should be clear that there is no point in adopting a federal system if we don’t want provinces because we had central and local levels even in the past. Provincial layer is an integral part of federalism. So, we have to think about transferring certain rights from local to provincial level because the local units don’t have expertise to oversee education up to grade 12 on their own. Our local units are traditionally trained in local development activities. But now they are entrusted with the responsibility of not only overseeing education and health issues but also with legislative and judicial functions. They haven’t been able to play that role. We should think about transferring some roles from local to provincial levels. Likewise, the centre should be ready to allow the provinces to exercise their rights bestowed by the constitution. It is time to strengthen the provinces.You said direct election of executive heads in provinces could end instability at the provincial level. But what if a popular leader got elected chief minister but other political parties won majority seats in the provincial assemblies? In such a situation, the rival parties may not help the chief minister pass a budget or policies from the assembly.Yes, there are strengths and weaknesses of all systems. Such problems can be resolved because we see similar situations in other countries as well. Parties can’t prolong the deadlock in the House because they will be blamed for the impasse. One basis is that our local units are doing well under executive heads. So, we can practise it for a decade in the provinces and then apply it to the federal level based on that experience.Many forces and groups that aren’t happy with the present constitution, which was basically a compromise document. Once the constitution amendment process is open, they are certain to revive their demands. Will the situation be manageable?If the rights of historically marginalised communities are curtailed, they will certainly retaliate. If you try to go against the federal republic system and policy of inclusion, it may invite new conflicts. The proportional representation system is not a problem. Leaders made it unpopular by misusing it. We should find solutions to stop its misuse. We shouldn’t forget that this constitution is not only a constitution but also a key document of our peace process. This is not perfect but it was essential to end the conflict. Many say that while making a document of compromise, our constitution hasn’t followed the principles of constitutionalism. For instance, the hearing system is something unusual in a parliamentary system. As a constitutional expert, do you think we should also think about fixing such deviations?You are right. When we couldn’t change the people, we tried to add additional features as a measure to check the wrongdoings. Our leaders make appointments in key constitutional bodies guided by their personal and partisan interests. We copied the hearing practice from the presidential system with a view to check the leaders’ arbitrary appointments. It hasn’t been that effective. Therefore, we have proposed to give continuity to the hearing for political appointments but not in the appointments of judges because lawmakers don’t have the expertise to examine judges’ competence. Since lawmakers are mainly guided by the party’s whip and top leaders’ instructions, it rather increases political interference even in the judiciary. We have thus proposed to stop the hearing process for judges’ appointments.Many say that the judiciary hasn’t been federalized even though all other sectors have been restructured as per the three-tier federal system. Why this exception for the judiciary?Oh, you dragged me to a sensitive topic. One thing we shouldn’t forget is that we adopted a federal system not to unify small countries. We were already a united country. We adopted it to better manage our social diversity by involving all the communities in the governing system. We at the same time have to safeguard the country from disintegration. Judiciary, the national army and Nepali language are our institutional arrangements that can play a unifying role. Therefore, we didn’t make much changes in these three aspects.Some instances show that Nepal’s federalism might have been a bit more effective had the judiciary worked proactively. For instance, the court hasn’t decided even the cases filed by provinces years ago. What do you think about the judiciary’s role in this connection?Yes, those cases are still undecided. In the Constituent Assembly, the Maoist party had registered a proposal to form a separate constitutional court. The justices who were leading the judiciary at the time opposed the idea. It was later rejected. Then the idea to have a separate constitutional bench was included as a compromise deal. But it has failed to work effectively. It failed to decide election-related disputes. We have to review its jurisdiction. They have decided certain cases when there is public pressure. For instance they decided cases like House dissolution because there was constant public scrutiny. But they haven’t shown any interest in other important cases where constitutional interpretation is needed. Of late, a strong opinion is being built in favour of forming a separate constitutional court. These issues are being discussed seriously. This issue may emerge if the constitution amendment process begins.What we can infer from your analysis is that the constitution amendment process is not that easy. What are the basic things that should be and can be done in the constitution amendment at this stage?First, we should change the form of governance at the provincial level and go for a directly elected executive head. With this there will be no change in government in provinces after changes at the centre. The governments in provinces can work for five years with certainty. Second, we can transfer the powers that the local units have failed to exercise to provinces. And, the centre should allow the provinces to exercise the concurrent rights. By doing this the centre can reduce the overwhelming burden on it. While the provinces can play an implementing role, the federation can play a supervisory role. These things need to be fixed. We need some amendments to the constitution and some new laws for this. \nNepal has often earned global recognition for its progressive policies and inclusive stance on LGBTQIA+ rights. But do the global accolades Nepal has earned in terms of its progressiveness reflect the actual experiences of queer people here? The Post’s Aarati Ray sat down with Manisha Dhakal, executive director of the Blue Diamond Society and a leading advocate for LGBTQIA+ rights in South Asia for over 23 years.Nepal is often hailed for its progressive stance on queer rights, both in South Asia and globally. With over two decades of queer rights advocacy, how accurate do you find this portrayal?Many activists and commentators do describe Nepal as being progressive on queer rights. While this is partly true, especially when we consider the legal frameworks, the reality at the grassroots is quite different. On the one hand, Nepal’s constitution recognises LGBTQIA+ identities. Articles 12 and 18 mandate that “gender identity” be acknowledged on citizenship certificates, while Article 42 promises affirmative action and participation in government for sexual and gender minorities. Court decisions in Nepal, too, have been favourable for LGBTQIA+ rights, and unlike many former British colonies with Section 377-type laws that criminalise queer communities, Nepal has no such legal barriers. So, indeed, there are opportunities for activism, and progress has been made, particularly in terms of legal recognition. But, again, the rights enshrined in the constitution and affirmed by the courts have not been realised at the grassroots level. We are stuck with a limited focus, primarily on citizenship. The state claims that we’ve been given the right to identity and legal recognition, but even this is not fully realised. For example, the process of obtaining citizenship based on self-identification remains difficult, with government officials still unclear on how to implement these provisions. The broader narrative of Nepal being progressive is built on a superficial understanding of the situation.In August, Nepal’s Supreme Court ruled that Rukshana Kapali, a transgender woman, should be legally recognised as a woman on all documents without medical verification. How does this decision impact the future of LGBTQIA+ rights in Nepal?Rukshana’s case is a prominent victory, highlighting the judiciary’s support for LGBTQIA+ rights, especially compared to those of the executive and legislative branches. This ruling lays a strong foundation for similar future cases and will undoubtedly help in future activism. However, it’s important to note that the decision applies only to Kapali, meaning others will still need to go through the courts to have their gender identity legally recognised. How long must transgender individuals continue to endure lengthy court processes just to obtain citizenship?Even outside the courts, the bureaucratic hurdles—from medical reassignment surgeries to invasive checkups and long delays from the CDO (District Administration Office) to the Ministry of Home Affairs—can take years, with no guarantee of getting preferred names on legal documents. In many cases, even after completing the process, the names are inaccurately changed, such as altering Ram to Rama instead of the preferred name, like Manisha.We [Blue Diamond Society] get 15-20 complaints each year, primarily from transgender women, regarding difficulties in obtaining citizenship.The Supreme Court’s recent decision on same-sex marriage in Nepal has attracted global attention and gotten a positive response. Are there any limits to the court’s decision?After a long and arduous process, we secured temporary registration for same-sex marriages. On June 28, 2023, the Supreme Court, in the Pinky Gurung vs. Government of Nepal case, issued an interim order instructing the government to temporarily register same-sex marriages, including for those with “other” gender markers. That said, the Civil Code adopted in 2017 still defines marriage as a union between a ‘man’ and a ‘woman’.We, as a community, are pleased with the government’s temporary registration process. Yet it falls short of offering full marriage rights, including those related to property, adoption, and tax exemptions. While the court’s decision sets a supportive precedent, lack of clarity about the rights associated with the temporary certificate leaves many in limbo. So far, only around five couples have registered, and many in the community are hesitant to do so.The question remains: Can this temporary registration truly grant us the same recognition as heterosexual marriages? While the decision has garnered global praise, the LGBTQIA+ community on the ground continues to feel cheated of true equality. Our ultimate goal is to amend the Civil Code so that marriage is defined as a union between two individuals, rather than being restricted to one between male and female.Why do many court decisions on queer rights in Nepal, like of same-sex marriages, remain in limbo? Is this due to the government and courts trying to appease both conservative and progressive groups, or is it just a performative gesture of inclusivity?There are multiple factors at play. I think some responsibility also falls on activists. For example, when fighting for legal recognition since 2008, we should have advocated not only for the “third gender” or “other” but also for individuals who have transitioned from male to female or female to male. What’s more, policymakers and bureaucrats still lack awareness about human rights principles related to minority groups like the LGBTQIA+ community. Even though Nepal has ratified international conventions on human rights, these commitments have not been prioritised by lawmakers, which leads to this state of limbo and half-hearted inclusivity.As for the internal thought processes of bureaucrats and lawmakers, it’s hard to say. Many of them might still believe that the LGBTQIA+ community shouldn’t be granted full rights, so they engage in performative actions—appearing supportive on the surface to attract global attention but hesitating to fully advance our rights. This could explain why progress seems to stall midway.Queer rights have received some legal recognition. But how are they reflected in terms of social and cultural acceptance in Nepal?Legal changes and social acceptance need to go hand in hand. If we only focus on legal reforms without addressing societal attitudes, there will be no real change. We’ve seen this play out—there is legal recognition of gender identity, and temporary registration for same-sex marriage is available. Yet people struggle to fully realise these rights because of deep-rooted discrimination within families and society.In Nepal, a socially and culturally driven society, where family, relatives, and festivals play a major role, social acceptance is often more important than legal acceptance. When it comes to cultural acceptance, biases still persist. For example, it feels like we’re allowed to express ourselves openly only during the Pride Month in June. When we try to participate in other celebrations like Teej or Gaijatra, society often reacts negatively, asking why we need to “spoil” their festivals. This shows that social change is still lagging, despite the progress in legal rights.You mentioned that the queer community is often given the surface level of legal recognition. How is the state of the exercise of fundamental rights for LGBTQIA+ people in Nepal?Labelled as ‘gender and sexual minorities’, our broader struggles are ignored. When we raise concerns about poverty, food insecurity, or unemployment, the response we often get from government institutions and stakeholders is, “This isn’t our issue; it’s a gender problem.”We are just as much a part of society as anyone else. Issues like climate change, housing, and poverty affect us too. We want to be included in solutions, whether it’s participating in climate programs or being involved in community initiatives. Unfortunately, lawmakers and stakeholders often overlook that we are just as human as heterosexuals, with needs that go beyond legal recognition on paper.What are some aspects of the queer community that have not received enough attention in media narratives, and what tends to be unnecessarily highlighted?As I’ve mentioned before, the narrative surrounding our community often focuses heavily on issues like citizenship, while overlooking other important aspects of our lives. What’s missing is the correct representation of our contributions in various fields. Many LGBTQIA+ individuals are doctors, and experts in different professions, yet their accomplishments are only rarely acknowledged or represented. Instead, the focus often falls on the unfortunate image of some members of the community begging on the streets, which goes viral on social media.Another issue is the way we are predominantly associated with sex and sexuality. While these are important aspects of human identity, we are much more than that. We have other needs and rights that deserve attention. Unfortunately, the media tends to fixate on sexual aspects of the LGBTQIA+ community, reinforcing stereotypes. It’s time for the media to move beyond this narrow portrayal and include us in broader discussions that reflect the full scope of our lives.How has the current narrative of progressiveness in Nepal impacted real change for the LGBTQIA+ community?It’s time to move beyond this narrative of progressiveness. True progress should lead to further development, not be a barrier to it. Unfortunately, the current narrative seems to be stagnating.For instance, when we raise issues with the government, the response often is, “We’ve already given you the right to citizenship. You’re getting citizenship now.” Even when I travel people sometimes ask, “You’ve got citizenship, right? Things are becoming progressive.” This narrative of progressiveness has become an excuse for the government to claim they’ve done enough and to avoid further action.This surface-level progressiveness is used to showcase Nepal as forward-thinking internationally, but it hasn’t translated into real change for people at the grassroots. It also impedes activists’ efforts by providing the government with a shield against criticism. Until this narrative of progressiveness evolves into genuine, accountable action that goes beyond court decisions and performative gestures, it will continue to be a barrier to actual progress. \nThe weather will be partly to generally cloudy in Koshi Province, Madhesh Province, Bagmati Province and Gandaki Province and partly cloudy to mainly fair in the rest of the provinces on Thursday.Light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is likely to occur in some places of Koshi Province, Bagmati Province and Gandaki Province and at a few places of Madhesh Province and to occur in one or two places of the rest of the provinces, according to the Metrological Forecasting Division.There are chances of heavy rainfall at one or two places of Koshi Province and Bagmati Province.Tonight, it is forecasted to be partly to generally cloudy in Koshi Province, Madhesh Province, Bagmati Province, Gandaki Province, and Lumbini Province, and partly cloudy to mainly fair in the rest of the provinces.

Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nThe National Disaster Management Executive Committee under the home ministry on Monday announced relief schemes for families of those killed or missing in monsoon-induced floods and landslides. During a meeting on Monday, the committee decided that the families of those unaccounted for after ten days will be provided with relief equal to the amount given to the families of the deceased.The government has also decided to form a special task force within 15 days to assess the losses caused by rain-induced disasters across the country. The decision comes with the intent of offering timely compensation for those affected by the floods and landslides that are the result of incessant rains from September 27. As per the decision, relevant ministries will promptly commence the reconstruction of government and public buildings and transport infrastructure, including roadways and bridges.The committee also decided to provide temporary housing grants within seven days for the families that lost their homes. The committee stated that the district disaster management committees, led by the respective chief district officer (CDO), would facilitate and coordinate with the local and provincial bodies to implement these decisions.“The relief distribution programme is already underway,” Dil Kumar Tamang, information officer at the home ministry, told the Post. “As per the decision of the National Disaster Management Executive Committee’s meeting, we have provided Rs200,000 to each bereaved family, and temporary shelters are being arranged for those in need.”Due to the monsoon-induced floods and landslides, 238 people have lost their lives across the country as of Wednesday evening. Last week’s incessant rain caused water levels in Kathmandu’s major rivers, including Bagmati, Bishnumati, and Dhobikhola, to rise, flooding nearby settlements. Areas such as Nakkhu, Balkumari, and Gwarko in Lalitpur were also inundated after the Karmasasha, Nakkhu, Godavari, and Bagmati rivers breached their banks.In Bhaktapur, the Hanumante river crossed the danger mark, inundating several riverside settlements and displacing hundreds of people.Although the government official claimed that relief distribution had already begun, Min Kumar Magar, who resides along the Bagmati riverbank at Thapathali in Kathmandu, told the Post on Wednesday evening that he and other flood victims have yet to get any assistance. “Some police officers came by on Monday afternoon to collect data, but we are yet to get any relief,” Magar told the Post. Not only Magar, but Kumar Thapa, another flood victim who lives in Nakhipot, Lalitpur, also said his family had also not received any relief announced by the government. Madhav Prasad Dhungana, Kathmandu’s deputy chief district officer and spokesperson for the District Administration Office, says the district’s relief distribution is coordinated with the Nepal Red Cross Society and various municipalities. As relief is being distributed by area, it is possible that some people might not have received it yet, but they will soon, Dhungana said.“Soon after the heavy rainfall started on Saturday, our district administration office started distributing the relief,” Dhungana told the Post. “At present, we are focussing on helping those affected by heavy rains.”Dhungana said that as the government has adopted the one-door policy for relief distribution, all the relief that reaches needy people comes through the government.Relief distribution in Lalitpur district has been coordinated with local representatives, says the assistant CDO, Kalpana Ghimire Nepal, who is also the spokesperson for the Lalitpur CDO office. According to her, the Lalitpur administration has taken twin approaches while distributing aid to those in need. “Based on the request from local bodies, we have arranged for relief materials to be sent to the local units,” Nepal told the Post. “We have also started providing Rs200,000 to the families of the deceased from the disaster management fund.” Assistant CDO Nepal said they distributed relief money in the Godavari area on Tuesday and in the Lalitpur metropolitan area on Wednesday, and that the distribution will be continued for the next few days.Meanwhile, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has criticised the government’s relief distribution efforts as less than proactive. An NHRC official, citing reports, said the relief distribution is not satisfactory even in most areas within the Kathmandu Valley, let alone in remote parts of the country. “While some people may have received relief from certain organisations, the information sent by our team members from the field suggest that many people within the Kathmandu Valley have not gotten any help,” an NHRC official said.“When giving any kind of help, priority should be given to marginalised groups,” the deputy spokesperson of NHRC Shyam Babu Kafle told the Post. “In similar situations in the past, we have seen political parties giving priority to their own cadres for relief, and we have cautioned the government not to let that happen this time.” \nLight to moderate rainfall is likely in some places of Bagmati Province, especially in the hilly region on Thursday, while districts of Koshi Province could witness rainfall on Wednesday night as well.The Meteorological Forecasting Division of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology attributes these weather disturbances in the two provinces to the partial influence of a low-pressure system developing over northeast Assam in India, and monsoon winds.“Light to moderate rainfall is a normal phenomenon during the monsoon season,” said Sanjeev Adhikari, a meteorologist at the division. “We want to reassure everyone that there is no need to panic, and also request that they rely on the Met office’s updated bulletins.”Many people living in the cities and planning to return to their home villages during Dashain are concerned about news circulating on various online portals regarding the possibility of heavy to very heavy rainfall.“While some isolated instances of heavy rainfall could occur, we define heavy rainfall as amounts exceeding 50 millimetres in 24 hours,” said Adhikari. “Continuous rainfall is unlikely in the next two days, and conditions will improve after Friday.”Some districts of Koshi—Udayapur, Morang and Sunsari in particular—witnessed heavy rainfall on Wednesday. The Met office said the rainfall did not occur continuously in those areas.Many people who witnessed last week’s monsoon mayhem still worry about the rain and its aftermath. At least 228 people have been confirmed dead, while 25 others are still missing in the floods and landslides triggered by record-breaking precipitation in the three starting Thursday evening. As many as 159 people have been injured, and more than 14,802 others moved to safe places, according to Nepal Police. Floodwaters submerged many parts of the Kathmandu valley and other districts, with landslides and floods destroying homes, vehicles, bridges, and highways.Since the monsoon entered the country on June 10, at least 460 people have died and 84 others are missing. The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority (NDRRMA) said that 378 people have been injured in landslides, floods and lightning strikes, and 3,939 families have been affected.The monsoon season in Nepal typically starts on June 13 and ends on October 2. This year, however, the clouds from the south entered Nepal from the western region on June 10, three days ahead of the usual onset date. Last year, the monsoon began on June 14, a day before the normal date.The monsoon season, which delivers around 80 percent of the country’s total annual rainfall, generally lasts about 105 days. But, in recent years, it has been taking longer to withdraw.As predicted before the onset of monsoon, Nepal recorded above-average rainfall this season.Nepal is one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to the climate crisis and has witnessed extreme weather events over the past decade and a half.Evidence suggests that Nepal's maximum temperature is rising at a greater rate (0.056 degrees Celsius per year) than the global average of 0.03 degrees Celsius per year.Experts say extreme weather events—excess rainfall in a short period, continuous rains for several days after the monsoon, dry spells, droughts, below-average precipitation, and above-normal winter temperatures—have become more frequent in Nepal.Evidence suggests that maximum temperatures in Nepal are rising faster, at 0.056 degrees Celsius a year, compared to the annual global average rise of 0.03 degrees Celsius. \nNepal and Bangladesh on Wednesday agreed to sign an energy trade deal on Thursday.A Joint Steering Committee (JSC) meeting, jointly chaired by Nepal’s Energy Secretary Suresh Acharya and Senior Secretary at the Power Division, Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources, of Bangladesh, decided to sign the power sales agreement between the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA), Bangladesh Power Development Board and NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam amid a function in Kathmandu on Thursday, the Ministry of Energy said in a statement on Wednesday evening.As per the agreement, Bangladesh will import 40 megawatts of electricity from Nepal. The Indian side has also been involved in the trade deal as Nepal’s electricity will be transmitted to Bangladesh through the transmission infrastructure on the Indian territory. Nepal and Bangladesh are not territorially linked to each other.Nepal is estimated to sell 144,000 MWh (megawatt-hour) electricity in five months—mid-June to mid-November—at the rate of 6.4 US cents a unit.The Nepal-Bangladesh meeting also agreed to develop the Sunkoshi-3 hydropower project in a collaborative participatory modality between Nepal, Bangladesh and India, according to the ministry. They have decided to finalise a joint venture agreement in the next meeting.Originally scheduled for July 28, the signing was postponed due to political tension and change of government in Bangladesh.The two sides have also agreed to conduct a technical and financial feasibility study of the proposed cross-border transmission line for energy trade between Nepal and Bangladesh. For now, Nepal will transmit the energy to India through the 400KV Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur cross-border transmission line and before India transmits the equivalent to Bangladesh. The NEA will calculate the quantum of exported energy at the Mazaffarpur point. The NEA estimates an earning of around Rs330 million for the country through the sale. \nGoods arriving from the north and south for Dashain have been stuck in bordering areas for the last five days. As the major highways remain obstructed following the incidents of floods and landslides caused by the late September rains, there is little hope that the consignments will arrive in Kathmandu ahead of the festival.Hari Bahadur Gautam, president of the Nepal Traders Association, said that more than 300 containers have been stuck on the Tatopani and Kerung borders points as of Tuesday. Most containers carried festive and winter goods, especially readymade garments.The border with China has been closed since Friday due to the floods and landslides caused by incessant rainfall.Dashain shopping starts from Ghatasthapana on Thursday, the first of the ten-day festival. Most containers of goods have been stranded in Khasa and Kerung in China’s Tibet, and at the customs on the Nepali side, said Gautam. The landslides and floods have damaged the roads on both sides.He said that road repairs would not be possible before Dashain. The Bhotekoshi river swept away the Bailey bridge at Larcha near Tatopani, Nepal’s second largest customs on the northern border.Kumar Shrestha, ward chairman of Bhotekoshi Rural Municipality-2, said that the road is being repaired by putting a hume pipe in Larcha after two days of negotiations with the rural municipality.“We are trying to open the road by using excavators. It will take 2–3 days to reopen the road,” Shrestha said.Shrestha said temporary arrangements have been made by laying iron poles in the bridge for the movement of locals.“Though there is no authentic data on the containers stranded at the China border, traders say they have received only 5 percent of the goods they ordered for Dashain,” Gautam said.After the impact of the Covid-19 and the subsequent economic slowdown, traders hoped for sales recovery. “The flood and landslide, however, has stalled the cargo movement, shattering traders' hope,” Gautam said.In Kathmandu, most traders had stocked their goods on the banks of the Bagmati and Manohara rivers, which have also been flooded. Traders said that price hikes of goods are unavoidable to recover the losses.Due to floods on the Liping river, a large part of the bridge connecting Liping and Kodari has been damaged. Maintenance work has started, according to the Bhotekoshi rural municipality.“The traders have requested the government to immediately rebuild the Larcha and Liping bridges. Rajendra Sangraula, senior vice president of Nepal Freight Forwarders Association, said goods from India have been halted in the border areas as the road network connecting Kathmandu has been damaged. He said that since the transporters have hiked their freight charges, goods, particularly apparel, would be expensive in the Kathmandu market.The transporters have hiked the cargo fare of 12-wheeler trucks from Rs70,000 to Rs130,000 for Birgunj-Kathmandu. A loaded container that used to take a maximum of two days to arrive in Kathmandu from southern border points may now take days. The association said the exports are also stuck on the road.“Due to the high risk, transporters are not allowing their trucks to carry goods. Drivers are worried. This situation may increase the transit cost and, as a result, increase the prices,” Sangraula said.“The highway needs to be repaired promptly as further delays may increase the overall logistic cost,” Sangraula said.According to the association, the Tribhuvan Highway, which is currently blocked for cargo movement, used to see more than 100 goods-laden trucks coming daily from major customs like Birgunj, Biratnagar, and Bhairahawa.According to the Department of Customs, Nepal’s imports declined by 1.16 percent to Rs1.59 trillion in the last fiscal year, 2023-24, which ended in mid-July. The exports, too, declined by 3.03 percent to Rs152.38 billion in the same period.In the last fiscal year, Nepal imported goods worth Rs298.77 billion from China, while exports were Rs2.58 billion.Nepal imported goods worth Rs996.68 billion from India, while exports were Rs103.17 billion during the review period. \nNepal defeated Oman by 56 runs in the fifth match of the Canada T20 Tri-Series at King City on Wednesday.Nepal, after being put into bat, posted 157-7 in their allotted 20 overs as skipper Rohit Paudel played a crucial knock, remaining unbeaten on 56 from 44 balls, hitting two fours and four sixes.Contributions from Anil Sah (11), Aasif Sheikh (16), Dev Khanal (18), and Kushal Malla (19) helped Nepal build a competitive total.Fayyaz Butt was the standout bowler for Oman, taking three wickets for 23 runs.In response, Oman struggled against Nepal’s disciplined bowling attack and were bowled out for 101 in 17.5 overs. Zeeshan Maqsood top-scored for Oman with 35 off 30 balls, while Aqib Ilyas contributed 22. Oman lost wickets at regular intervals and failed to build momentum.Kushal Bhurtel picked three wickets as Sandeep Lamichhane, Rohit Paudel and Rijan Dhakal claimed two wickets each. \nNepal’s immediate neighbors India, China and other friendly countries have assured Nepali authorities of all possible cooperation and support to Nepal in the wake of the recent floods and landslides that killed at least 238 people.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday sent a letter to Prime Minister KP Oli expressing condolences for the loss of lives and pledging all possible assistance, said a senior official at the Prime Minister Office.“India stands with Nepal in this hour of grief,” said Modi in his letter, adding, “As always, India is also ready to support and extend all possible cooperation to Nepal.”In his letter, Modi has mentioned that India will support Nepal in the search, rescue and reconstruction bid of Nepal.Naveen Srivastava, Indian ambassador to Nepal, handed the letter to Prime Minister Oli, while the Indian Embassy in Kathmandu delivered copies to the Prime Minister’s Office and Ministry of Foreign Affairs.Likewise, Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi on Wednesday sent a message of condolences to Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba, over the severe floods and landslides in Nepal.According to the Chinese official news agency, Xinhua, Wang, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee said he was shocked to learn that heavy rainfall in Nepal has triggered severe floods and landslides, resulting in significant casualties and property losses.He also expressed deep condolences over the deaths and sincere sympathies to the bereaved families and the injured, according to the news report. China is willing to provide support within its capacity, said Wang.“As a friendly neighbor linked by mountains and rivers, China has always shared weal and woe with Nepal and is ready to provide support and assistance within its capacity for Nepal’s flood relief in light of its needs,” said Wang.  The Chinese Red Cross Society has already donated $100,000 to the Nepali for Nepalis affected by the recent floods and landslide.Chinese Ambassador to Nepal, Chen Song handed over a cheque of $100,000 to Nepal Red Cross Society through the Ministry of Home Affairs on Wednesday.Likewise, British King Charles III also sent a message of condolence to the President Ramchandra Paudel.Charles said he and the Queen were “heartbroken” at the “devastating effects” on the Himalayan nation and that the UK stands ready to help President Paudel support those in need, according to the British news agency, Press Association.The disaster came just ahead of the country’s biggest festival Dashain, which begins on Thursday, when people return home to celebrate with their families.The King said: “My wife and I were heartbroken to see the devastating effects of flooding and landslides in Nepal over the weekend. Many in the United Kingdom have strong, deep and personal ties to Nepal, not least through the Gurkhas and their outstanding contribution to the British Army.“Together with the British public, we send our deepest condolences to those who have so tragically lost their loved ones, and who continue to be affected. As always, the United Kingdom stands ready to help you support those most in need.“As many in Nepal begin to mark important festivals, I particularly hope that families might still be able to come together, even at such an incredibly difficult time.” Likewise, Russian President Vladimir Putin has sent condolence telegrams to President Paudel and Prime Minister Sharma Oli over the deaths caused by landslides and floods, the Russian embassy in Kathmandu told TASS, a Russian news agency.Federation Council Speaker Valentina Matviyenko and State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin also sent condolences to the Nepali authorities.\"Russian national flags were lowered at the Russian embassy in Nepal and at the ambassador's residence in Kathmandu as a sign of mourning for the victims of the natural disaster,\" the Russian diplomatic mission said.Several Kathmandu based diplomatic missions have also expressed concerns over the recent floods and landslide in Nepal and expressed their readiness to support the government of Nepal. \nConcerns are growing about a possible rise in home deliveries in several districts after road links were disrupted last week’s devastating floods and landslides.Officials at the Ministry of Health and Population said that they are aware of the growing risk and have instructed agencies concerned to start risk mapping.“The risk of home deliveries has grown due to last week’s monsoon havoc,” said Dr Bikash Devkota, director general at the Department of Health Services. “We have instructed agencies concerned to monitor the situation and report back. We also held discussions with our development partners about the risks and requested them for help.”At least 233 people have been confirmed dead, while 22 others are still missing in the floods and landslides triggered by record-breaking precipitation in three days starting Thursday evening last week. As many as 169 people have been injured, and more than 17,120 others were shifted to safety, according to Nepal Police. Transport links to many districts have been disrupted by the floods and landslides that swept the roads and bridges in many places. Health facilities and birthing centres in many places were also destroyed in the disaster.Maternal health experts say that the recent disaster could cause a severe setback to maternal and child health and also affect institutional delivery rate.“Due to the disruption in vehicular movements, many pregnant women may not be able to reach birthing centres,” said Nisha Joshi, a public health official at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “Pregnant women and new mothers who have lost family members or property in the disasters would be unable to reach hospitals or health facilities for childbirth.”Health officials say that they have cautioned health workers in the affected areas about the heightened risk of an increase in home deliveries, which increases the risk of maternal and newborn deaths.A report on maternal mortality carried out by the National Statistics Office in 2021 showed that for every 100,000 live births, 151 women still died from maternity-related complications. Similarly, the institutional delivery rate has reached around 80 percent. Maternal death rate and home delivery rate are very high in remote areas. “We are aware of the risk of a rise in home deliveries, which poses a threat to the health of mothers and their newborn,” said Joshi. “We have requested the United Nations Population Fund and Nepal Red Cross Society to distribute warm clothes to 12 new mothers in the Nakkhu area of Lalitpur, who are taking refuge in makeshift shelters.”Maternal health experts say expecting mothers may face difficulties in attending regular checkups during pregnancy, which could put both their lives and babies at risk. Along with a potential drop in institutional deliveries, the number of antenatal and postnatal visits could also decline due to the impact of the disaster, according to them.With the government announcing free institutional delivery service in 2009 at all state-run health facilities, more than 2,800 birthing centres were set up across the country. The institutional delivery rate, which was around 18 percent then, has now increased to an average of around 80 percent across the country. The health ministry also provides travel allowances for antenatal care visits, offers skilled birth attendant (SBA) training to staff nurses, and hires them at birthing centres to help prevent deaths during or after childbirth.Nepal had cut the maternal mortality rate from 539 per 100,000 births in 1996 to 239 per 100,000 births in 2016—for which the country even received a Millennium Development Goals award.In the last fiscal year, at least 190 women from 51 districts died of complications during childbirth, data provided by the health ministry shows.The actual number of maternal deaths due to birth-related complications could be much higher, as maternal and perinatal death surveillance is being carried out in 51 districts only, officials say.Nepal’s target under the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals is to reduce the maternal mortality rate to 75 per 100,000 births by 2030. \nForeign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba on Wednesday called for stronger cooperation among Asia Cooperation Dialogue (ACD) member states to harness artificial intelligence’s (AI) potential for shared prosperity.Speaking at the ACD Business Forum in Doha, Qatar, Minister Rana highlighted AI’s role in shaping global financial architecture, governance, and key sectors like education, health, and security. She stressed the need to address data security, disinformation, and the digital divide.According to the Nepali Embassy in Doha, Minister Rana also urged foreign investors to explore opportunities in Nepal across diverse sectors, including energy, tourism, manufacturing, agriculture, infrastructure development, education, health, and AI.She highlighted Nepal’s conducive business environment and invited business delegations from ACD member states to capitalise on these investment prospects.The forum, held under the theme “Artificial Intelligence and New Business Models,” was attended by the Qatari Minister of Trade and Industry Mohammed bin Hamad bin Qassim Al Thani, deputy prime ministers, ministers from ACD member states, and representatives from the private sector.Rana, who is leading a Nepali delegation that includes Foreign Secretary Sewa Lamsal and other officials, is set to address the Third ACD Summit on Thursday. She also visited the Nepali Embassy in Doha to review its activities and instructed officials to ensure effective consular services for Nepali expatriates.The delegation arrived in Doha on Tuesday afternoon. \nNepal, India, and Bangladesh have signed a trilateral agreement to trade 40 megawatts of electricity. The historic deal, signed in Kathmandu on Thursday, allows Nepal to sell electricity to a third country for the first time. So far, Nepal’s energy trade has been taking place only with the southern neighbour India. The agreement was signed by Kulman Ghising, executive director of the Nepal Electricity Authority, Renu Narang, CEO of India's NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam, and Mohammad Rezaul Karim, chairman of Bangladesh Power Development Board amid a function in Kathmandu. Energy Minister Deepak Khadka, Minister of State for Energy Purna Bahadur Tamang, and Bangladeshi Minister for Forest, Environment, Climate Change, and Water Resources Syeda Rizwana Hasan witnessed the signing of the deal.As per the agreement, Bangladesh will now import 40 megawatts of electricity from Nepal. The Indian side has also been involved in the trade deal as Nepal’s electricity will be transmitted to Bangladesh through the transmission infrastructure on the Indian territory. Nepal and Bangladesh are not territorially linked to each other.Nepal is estimated to sell 144,000 MWh (megawatt-hour) of electricity in five months—mid-June to mid-November—at the rate of 6.4 US cents a unit.Originally scheduled for July 28, the signing was postponed due to political tension and a change of government in Bangladesh.For now, Nepal will transmit the energy to India through the 400KV Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur cross-border transmission line and before India transmits the equivalent to Bangladesh. The NEA will calculate the quantum of exported energy at the Mazaffarpur point. The NEA estimates an earning of around Rs330 million for the country through the sale. \nThe tussles between the bench and the bar, two complementary branches of the judiciary in normal course, are becoming far too common in Nepal. The conflict between the two sides is a worrying sign for the overall health of the country’s legal system. Take the recent appointment of two Supreme Court justices as the most recent case in point. The Judicial Council on September 27 nominated two high court chief judges as Supreme Court justices even as lawyers were protesting against the possible nominations. The dispute took a nasty turn after the Supreme Court administration on Tuesday filed a contempt of court case against Nepal Bar Association President Gopal Krishna Ghimire for criticising the justice selection process. He had accused the council of picking the two justices based on a monetary deal.With the filing of the contempt case, the confrontation has entered a new stage, for the original dispute was limited to the judges’ hierarchy. The bar demanded the correction of a provision, which was included in a recently amended regulation, that “unfairly demoted judges” appointed from among lawyers, placing them below career judges in the hierarchy. It was an issue that could (and should) have been amicably resolved through negotiations between the two sides. Both sides are at fault. The protest of the Bar President Ghimire could have been more effective had he clearly spelled out how exactly money changed hands during the judge-appointment process (if he had such evidence in the first place). What we see of late is leaders of our vital institutions giving provocative statements to further complicate things instead of speaking based on facts and with an intent of giving solutions to existing problems.The top court justices in turn took serious exception to Ghimire’s remarks. But those in the leadership should also not forget that the judiciary is not free from anomalies. Several study panels including those led by Shrihari Aryal, Ram Prasad Shrestha, Girish Chandra Lal and Harikrishna Karki all have pointed out the malpractices that are rampant in courts. The report of the panel led by Karki, who later became chief justice, was widely discussed as it categorically described anomalies including the unwanted influence of middlemen in the court and underscored the need to urgently address the problem. Accordingly, while presenting his action plan, during his parliamentary hearing on Wednesday, proposed chief justice Prakash Man Singh Raut pledged to reform laws to remove the problem of middlemen in courts.It was only two years ago that both the bar and judges were on a warpath against the then chief justice Cholendra Shamsher Rana. Justices as well as lawyers had boycotted hearings demanding Rana’s resignation. Hence, the judiciary that is entrusted with a big responsibility of arbitrating disputes of other individuals and institutions has itself come into dispute. Thousands of cases are pending in courts. Common folks have to wait for years for justice. There is no way Nepal’s justice delivery system can be improved without the bar and the bench closely working together. Instead, their acrimonious public debate threatens not only to delay the system even more. It will also further erode the public’s faith in the judiciary.  \nBack in 1983, India was trundling along, as it had since independence, at its ‘Hindu rate of growth’. I was in Calcutta, enrolled in a college, but generally being educated in other ways. One such edifying instance was when a friend and I walked into what looked like a nice-looking store on a side road off the famous Park Street. As we entered, there was a flurry of movement among the store clerks arrayed behind the long U-shaped counter that went around the room, and we were taken aback at the sight of all those ‘uncles’ standing up ready to serve us teenagers. My friend was hoping to buy a shirt for his father but upon hearing the prices we made a dignified but hasty exit; a single shirt would have cost nearly as much as our entire monthly allowance.That such high-end shops even existed was a testament to the purchasing power of a small group of wealthy Indians who have always been around. According to a recent research paper, in the early 1980s, the top 10 percent owned 45 percent of India’s national wealth. Given the population of India, that would have been a number large enough to keep the luxury goods market humming.Following the liberalisation of the early 1990s, the Indian economy took off, with its GDP galloping 13-fold since 1991. Ours also grew by 10 times, but because the Indian economy is 90 times larger, the actual volume of increase there is staggering. Over the decades, there have been visible changes in how people live, dress and spend and also in infrastructural growth everywhere. The Indian middle class is now 400–600 million strong, depending on how one defines it. And, as The Economist put it, with enough spending clout that ‘[a]round the world tourism boards, hotels and restaurateurs are starting to compete for Indian travellers’. All stuff of dreams for a country like ours, characterised by perennial misgovernance and mismanagement.Other side of the story Sadly, that is only part of the equation since India’s rise has masked extreme inequalities. The concentration of wealth at the top has worsened, with the top 10, 1 and 0.1 percent, respectively, owning 65, 40, 29 percent of the national wealth. Conversely, in 1991, the bottom 50 percent and the middle 40 percent possessed 9 and 41 percent of the country’s wealth. By 2023, their share had gone down to 7 and 29 percent; the richest 1 percent of Indians owned more than the combined total of 90 percent of their compatriots at the bottom.So, what does that mean for people at the margins? Part of the answer is to be found in a remarkable book I chanced upon, Unequal: Why India Lags Behind Its Neighbours, by Swati Narayan of the OP Jindal Global University. Published in late 2023, the author compares India with Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka. Since I could not find any discussion of the book in our media, this piece provides a few insights from it, albeit limited mainly to Nepal.Although she uses national figures, when taking specific examples from North India, Narayan compares the state of Bihar with Bangladesh and Nepal given the similarity in average incomes in all three. She looks at various indicators to forcefully lay out the case that despite its impressive growth, India has slowly become the regional laggard.Narayan found that students in Bihar’s government schools invariably sat on the floor compared to the 85 percent of students in Nepal and 66 percent in Bangladesh who were at desks. As someone coming after fieldwork in Bihar, she was quick to note that in her study village in the hills of Sindhuli, ‘the seating arrangements did not reflect any bias based on caste or religion’.Infant mortality in India was 33 per 1000 live births compared to 29 in Bangladesh and Nepal, with the latter ‘amongst the fastest countries of the developing world to reduce child deaths—even in the thick of a guerrilla war’. In terms of malnutrition among children up to the age of six, 22 and 27 percent, respectively, in Bangladesh and Nepal were to be ‘too thin for their age’, a figure that was 32 percent in India. In the provision of health services, major differences were evident. Her survey found that far more health facilities in Nepal and Bangladesh had stocked at least half of the 13 basic medicines. No wonder people from Uttar Pradesh ‘routinely cross the border to go to Nepal, as healthcare was cheaper and better there’.When asked if people in their family had gone to bed on an empty stomach, Narayan found women in Bangladesh and Nepal to be ‘truly puzzled by this question’ and that over 90 percent of her respondents were quite certain no one had. That was not the case in Bihar where the ‘downcast eyes [of the women] and silences spoke volumes of their own haunting deprivation’.Unmistakable improvements Narayan’s book is a treasure trove of such figures. But I also found some of her narrative descriptions more revealing. I present one such longish vignette that struck me.‘Her sleeveless dress and quiet confidence were a breath of fresh air in the dusty, ramshackle home. Most of the other women in this family, from the Dom caste, were dressed in crumpled saris. Renu’s husband, Jitu, too, in his smart shorts, looked completely out of place in this remote Bihari village. After we struck up a conversation, I realized that the young couple had just crossed the open border, less than a kilometre away, from Nepal to Bihar on a day trip to visit their family…The contrasts between these relatives who lived on different sides of the international border could not have been starker. In Kathmandu, Renu worked in a private canteen, while Jitu was a mechanic. The young couple were upwardly mobile and in good health and spirits. As a Nepali, Renu’s education in government schools had been free until grade eight. Every time her nine-month-old infant fell ill, she confidently took her to a nearby government health post for free treatment. The brimming self-assurance of this bright, young Dalit couple was not an exception. Since the return of democracy in 2006, as my research even a decade later showed, Nepal has witnessed an unmistakeable improvement in caste and gender equations…Their Indian relatives, on the other hand, were struggling to eke out a living. Renu’s sister-in-law Malati, who was born in Nepal and had shifted to India two decades ago after marriage, complained about the caste discrimination that her children faced in school. She also confided that she was petrified of her family falling ill. In this Bihari hinterland, there were no health centres nearby, nor were free medicines available.’Narayan asks why Nepali women seem to be more empowered than their sisters in Bangladesh and Bihar, and why the governments of Bangladesh and Nepal have focused more on education and health. She believes that is because the emphasis has been on reducing inequalities arising from differences in wealth, caste and gender, a feat India seems to have lost sight of in its push for unbridled growth.A comparative study of this kind certainly would not be able to capture the many nuances within a country as complex as Nepal. Narayan conducted her research in 2016, but we can only presume that we are still on the same right track despite all the governments that have come and gone since. As we usher in the festive season of Dashain, Tihar and Chhath, that would be something to cheer about. \nOne might say that nothing will happen and that the world will continue just as it has so far. However, after last week and the endless volley of attacks, bombings and assassinations we witnessed, it certainly feels like something is imminent.True to their métier, the world’s astrologers portend events based on an annular solar eclipse set to take place today. Solar eclipses—or so they say—represent the death of a ‘solar’ figure: Perhaps a monarch or a leader who dies, is deposed, or loses power in some other way. Adding to all the malevolent possibilities, astrologers say that the reappearance of several ‘stars’, whose earlier presence had brought discord, does not augur well and that these stars feature prominently in the astrological chart of the United States.Astrology must always be taken with a grain of salt: after all, there are soothsayers on both sides of the fence, and the way an event—any event under discussion—plays out will prove one side more ‘accurate’ than the other.However, prophecies and auguries are not needed. It does not take much looking around to note that the world, always tumultuous, is undergoing exceptional mayhem. It is not only the events that have dominated the Middle East which portend terrible outcomes. Undoubtedly, the ongoing war in the Middle East, the barbarous Israeli bombings of Gaza, and now Beirut and southern Lebanon, are significant factors in the assessment of the dire international situation. But on a wider scale, too, everything points to escalations, one-upmanship, covert actions, and undisclosed secret actors.Even if we choose to ignore the specifics of these conflicts and carefully insulate ourselves so that we are not exposed to the news and its macabre content, the general malaise is contagious. Anxiety is heightened because in witnessing the helplessness of others one dwells even more on one’s own set of circumstances.Repeatedly watching people suffer—thanks to the age of social media—is a particular predicament of our age. Experts have already found that it increases levels of latent anxiety in people. So does confronting problems that one is not able to address. And in our world, we seem to be surrounded by challenges that do not appear to have a solution.Wars undoubtedly belong to this latter category. This weekend, as Beirut was pummelled by the Israeli Defence Forces, it was dispiriting to watch members of the UN Security Council (UNSC) talk past one another while people were being killed in real time. As a recent report issued by the charity Oxfam notes, this multilateral body, which was created with the specific intent of preventing catastrophe, has failed miserably in its mandate.The report, Vetoing Humanity, says in its summary: “A handful of powerful nations who represent only 25 per cent of the world population but hold its nuclear button, have too often manipulated the global peace and security system to meet their geopolitical and economic interests. Between 2014 and 2024, one or more of the five permanent UNSC member states … vetoed 30 UNSC resolutions on protracted crises, including resolutions on the Occupied Palestinian Territory … and Israel, Ukraine, Syria and Yemen.”The Middle East war may dominate the headlines, but other major conflicts may be waiting in the wings. Over in the South China Sea, a situation is escalating. For several years, China has been constructing and lately fortifying islands that are decreasing the physical distance between itself and the Philippines. In the past two weeks, China and the Philippines’ coastguard have had skirmishes. The fight is over an area of the South China Sea called the Sabina Shoals, which the Philippines wishes to control because it is key to its trade routes with the rest of the world. Given that China has also had testy exchanges with Taiwan, the area seems poised to become a major flashpoint for a wider conflict.Then there is Europe. American newspapers in the past two weeks have been full of ominous editorials warning that Ukrainian soldiers are about to bleed out of the conflict because of the lack of support from the US. Others point out that the issue is not only the Russia and Ukraine theatre but also Russia’s assistance to Iran, which could cross the nuclear finish line, causing a huge shift in the power balance in the region.It is a good time to keep a diary or a journal. Accounts of such documents kept by people during World War II show a variety of perspectives of the same sets of events. In fact, much before the war broke out, even before the rise of Hitler, some people had recognised the pockets of hostility that would propel tensions towards a massive conflict.Others felt safe until the Gestapo came knocking at their door and dragged them out of their comfortable homes in Berlin or Vienna or Krakow or Paris to be transported to the deathly gas chambers. All of them have perished but their accounts remain to tell us who was right and who had no idea of what was going happen.So, too, will it be with us. Whoever is ultimately right about the future — the ones that prophesy peace or those who warn of war — will be dead by the time the ultimate outcome is known. In this sense, the accounts of the past provide an odd source of solace: Whatever ills may be peculiar to this age of internet, wars have wreaked havoc on human lives for far longer.Then again, perhaps those are the rationalising words of someone who is not directly facing the rain of bullets or barrage of bombs, which are taking lives thousands of kilometres away from their vantage point.-Dawn (Pakistan)/ANN \nThe record-breaking recent rains, which have so far claimed 217 lives and left dozens missing nationwide, have badly disrupted major highways out of Kathmandu just days ahead of the Dashain holidays. At different points on several of these routes, the Nepal Army, the Armed Police Force, the Nepal Police, other agencies and local people are relentlessly working to clear the debris. But by and large authorities do not appear serious about ensuring safe and accessible travel during the Dashain travel rush. Every year, during Dashain and Tihar, a big mass of people leave Kathmandu to travel to their home districts. Last year, around 1.5 million people did, according to the Nepal Transport Entrepreneurs Association. The Dashain travel is an ordeal for Nepalis every year due to the bad road conditions, traffic jams and the competition to buy tickets on time at a reasonable price. However, road disruptions this time have already made the people wary of travelling. Among the routes linking Kathmandu with various parts of Nepal, Prithivi Highway is currently the only functioning one. According to the Department of Roads, BP Highway linking eastern Nepal with Kathmandu Valley is obstructed at Nepalthok, Kavre. Similarly, Kanti Rajpath, the alternative highway connecting Kathmandu to the Tarai regions and the Araniko Highway, have also been disrupted at various places. Moreover, other roads in the hilly regions are not fit for operation. Even in the case of Prithivi Highway, the route is still risky as only one-way traffic has been open along the Jhyaple Khola and Jawang Khola sections. Although more routes might be accessible in the coming days as the Department plans diversion roads for Dashain travel, this would only mean longer travel times and more risks as rainfall in the coming days could disturb the fragile roads.Roads are the major means of travel for Nepalis, especially during the festivals when air ticket prices soar and become unaffordable for many. On Saturday, after the disaster struck several parts of Nepal, there was a hike in air ticket prices. People fretted online about how the Kathmandu-New Delhi flight was cheaper than the Kathmandu-Dhangadhi flight. Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli appealed to the domestic airlines to maintain regular ticket prices or offer discounts. The airline companies did agree to reduce the price for three days following public outcry. On Tuesday, the companies further agreed to continue this until the roadways become operational again. Whatever the airline companies do or don’t do, the government cannot overlook the conditions of the country’s major highways as far too many Nepalis simply have no financial means to fly. Dashain places a heavy financial burden on the average Nepali, especially with the rising prices of goods. The floods and landslides are already translating into hikes in the price of day-to-day necessities. Given the sorry condition of the highways, people are deciding not to travel to their home districts. Moreover, the Federation of Nepali National Transport Entrepreneurs closed advance bus ticket booking for Dashain on Tuesday. This seems reasonable. However, the authorities must be vigilant about transporters using this tactic to cram in passengers at the last moment. The government must mobilise all its resources to repair the damaged highways. Nepalis of late have not had much to celebrate. Continuous political instability, rising prices and natural disasters have been frequent downers. The least the government can do now is to repair the highways on a war footing and ensure that people of all economic backgrounds get to celebrate the festivals with their loved ones. \nNepal on Thursday signed a business-to-business framework agreement with India in New Delhi to build several petroleum projects. This comes amid environmentalists' call for an end to new investments in fossil fuel pipelines as Nepal has all the feasible cleaner alternatives.The development comes a week after Nepal’s Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli addressed the 79th session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, calling for climate justice. He told the assembly about Nepal’s plan to achieve a net-zero emission target by 2045, five years ahead of the global target.Environmentalists say Nepal’s policy has reversed the blueprint for the country’s second Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC), which outlines its ambitious targets for the next decade to reduce emissions and support vulnerable communities in adapting to the impacts of climate change.The NDC outlines Nepal’s mitigation efforts, which include a commitment to promote renewable energy and electric mobility and manage forests.Under the business-to-business agreement, the Indian government will build a 50-km cross-border pipeline from Siliguri, India, to Charali, Jhapa. In Charali, a smart green field terminal with the capacity for 18,900 kilometres will be built. Both projects are being built with an Indian grant.According to a statement issued by Nepal Oil Corporation, Chandika Prasad Bhatta, managing director of Nepal Oil Corporation, and Senthil Kumar, director of Indian Oil Corporation, signed the agreement in New Delhi in the presence of Pankaj Jain, secretary of the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, and Satish Kumar, chairman of Indian Oil.The statement reads that the Indian government has also agreed to build a 62 km long petroleum pipeline from Amalekhgunj to Lothar, Chitwan in Nepal, on grant. “Agreement was also done to build a 91,900-kilolitre capacity smart green field terminal with an investment from Nepal Oil Corporation in the technical support of India.”India will provide a grant of Rs15 billion for the three petroleum projects built in Nepal. Under the business-to-business agreement, a business contract between two parties, Nepal’s position on the length of the supply agreement is unclear.“During the government-to-government agreement, it was agreed that all four projects would be completed within 54 months,” said Manoj Thakur, deputy director of Nepal Oil Corporation. “The work will start soon.”“Once we hand over the land to Indian Oil Corporation, the Indian side will design the project,” he said.The project design is expected to take 3-6 months to complete. The land purchase in Jhapa and Chitwan has been already concluded, said Thakur. An energy expert said that Nepal’s private sector is aggressively investing in the hydro sector, and the government’s investment in petroleum infrastructure could be a setback for them and the country.Nepal needs to substitute fossil fuels with green energy to reduce the ever-growing trade deficit, Bhushan Tuladhar, an environmental expert, told the Post in a recent interview. “Instead of investing in fuel pipelines, the government should invest in renewable hydropower, cross-border energy trade and installation of charging stations for EVs.”In the UNGA, the prime minister said that Nepal is hard hit by climate change and is one of the most vulnerable nations to it, ranking it the 20th most disaster-prone country in the world.“Nepal has been contributing to the health of our planets through its forest, mountains and rivers. Despite the efforts, we continue to bear the brunt of climate change. In this context, we call for climate justice,” said the prime minister.In 2021, the International Energy Agency called for an immediate end to new investments in fossil fuel supply projects such as pipelines.It urged the rapid adoption of renewable energy, such as solar and wind power and a large-scale research and development programme to develop future technologies, including advanced batteries, producing energy from hydrogen, and removing CO2 from the atmosphere.The report, entitled Net Zero by 2050: A Roadmap for the Global Energy Sector, says that with global greenhouse gas emissions continuing to rise, current pledges to cut CO2 “would fall well short” of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 and holding global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit).The International Energy Agency says the world has a “viable” yet “narrow” path to avoiding disruptive climate change and must embrace “an unprecedented transformation of how energy is produced, transported and used globally”.The agency also calls for quadrupling solar and wind power capacity in the next decade and a global push to adopt energy efficiency improvements of 4 percent annually by 2030.This rapid transition from fossil fuels must also occur as the world provides electricity to 785 million people who currently lack clean-cooking technologies and the 2.6 billion people who lack them. The International Energy Agency says that this suite of measures to wean the economy off fossil fuels will add $5 trillion in energy investments by 2030, create millions of jobs, and lead to a global gross domestic product in 2030 four percent higher than a business-as-usual approach.In Nepal, according to the Department of Customs, the import of petroleum products amounted to Rs337.34 billion in the last fiscal year, nearly 20 percent of the country’s total import bills.Petroleum products are Nepal’s top imported products and are dependent on India.Nepal's government has also introduced an ambitious hydropower roadmap to fulfill its net-zero emission commitment by 2045.In the transport sector, Nepal has launched a strategy to increase the sales of electric vehicles (EVs) to 90 percent of all private passenger vehicles, including two-wheelers, sold and 60 percent of all four-wheeler public passenger vehicle sales by 2030.Massive tax waivers have been given on EV imports to promote electricity and reduce fossil fuel imports.The government has also set a goal of installing 500,000 improved cooking stoves, primarily in rural areas, and an additional 200,000 household biogas plants and 500 large-scale biogas plants.Nepal’s strategy is to have electric stoves as the primary mode of cooking in 25 percent of households by 2030. To meet this target, Nepal would need to invest $25 billion.Nepali politicians have been making many promises to switch to clean energy. Still, according to experts, the other hand is building a spree of petroleum projects, a mockery to the translation for clean energy. \nIndia’s Supreme Court asked authorities on Thursday to report back within a week on what they were doing to stop farmers from burning crop residue as smog began to pollute the air in the capital Delhi and surrounding regions, local media reported.Farmers in the northern states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh burn crop stubble after rice is harvested around October to clear the fields before planting wheat crops.The smoke contributes to a toxic smog that engulfs Delhi, frequently making it the world’s most polluted capital ahead of winter as calm winds and lower temperatures trap pollutants in the air.Federal and state authorities have encouraged farmers to stop burning crop residue and penalised those that do but have not been able to fully curb the practice due to the large area involved and the hostility of farmers in some places.“In some of the districts in Punjab and Haryana the incidents of stubble burning increased substantially as compared to 2023,” legal news website Live Law reported the court as saying. “However, all (that) the states have done is to recover nominal compensation from 42 and 45 farmers respectively.”A government website monitoring crop burning showed about 200 fires almost every day in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh since the middle of September.The court also pulled up the Commission for Air Quality Management, a government body responsible for air quality in the national capital region, saying it “does not seem to be making any efforts to follow up implementation of its own directions”.The court asked the commission, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and state authorities to report within one week on the action being taken to stop crop residue burning.India was rated the third most polluted country last year by Swiss group IQAir, behind Bangladesh and Pakistan. New Delhi ranked sixth on a real-time list of the world’s most polluted cities with the air quality index at 115 on Thursday, a level considered unhealthy for sensitive groups.India’s weather office has forecast moderate air quality in the capital until Oct. 6 and then moderate-to-poor for six days after that.Experts fear air quality could further deteriorate from mid-October when farm fires are expected to increase before peaking towards the end of the month and beginning of November. \nSix migrants died after Mexican soldiers fired on a group of 33 migrants traveling in a pick-up truck that had tried to evade a military patrol, the defense ministry said on Wednesday, underlining tensions on Mexico’s southern border as it faces US pressure to contain migration.Another 10 migrants were injured in the incident on Tuesday evening, the ministry said in a statement. The group included people of Egyptian, Nepalese, Cuban, Indian and Pakistani nationality, though the statement did not specify the nationalities of the deceased.The ministry said the incident took place just before 9 p.m. local time on Tuesday while the patrol traveled on a highway near the town of Huixtla, some 40 km (25 miles) from Tapachula, by the Guatemalan border.The pick-up truck was followed by two vehicles similar to those used by criminal groups in the area, it said, and soldiers reported hearing explosions after which two officers opened fire.Four migrants were killed at the scene while two others died later in hospital.The deaths shine a renewed spotlight on Mexico’s policy towards migrants as well as the growing role of the military in the country’s security.“These events are neither accidental nor isolated, they are a consequence of the restrictive immigration policies that the Mexican state continues to implement,” the Collective for the Monitoring of the Southern Border, a grouping of advocacy and civil society organizations, said in a statement.Mexico has been under pressure by the United States to reduce the number of migrants arriving at their shared border, where record numbers of people have tried to cross in recent years, fleeing economic hardship and violence.In recent months illegal border crossings have fallen, as the Biden administration has toughened its approach to border security in the run-up to the November 5 elections, where Vice President Kamala Harris faces Republican Donald Trump, who has vowed a wide-ranging crackdown if reelected.Tapachula, in southern Chiapas state, is an entry point into Mexico for many migrants making the arduous journey towards the United States. Chiapas has also seen clashes this year between the Jalisco New Generation Cartel and Sinaloa Cartel. In July, the turf wars sent some 600 people fleeing across the border into Guatemala.Mexico's defense ministry said the two soldiers who fired on the migrants were removed from their posts and federal prosecutors had been informed. A military tribunal will also carry out its own investigation.It said it reaffirmed “its commitment to act in strict accordance with the rule of law, under a policy of zero-impunity, and is ready to help the civil authorities to shed light on the facts.”The ministry added it was coordinating with Mexico’s foreign ministry to contact corresponding embassies. \nNepal and Bangladesh discuss strengthening bilateral relations, particularly in energy cooperation, with Bangladesh importing 40 MW of electricity from Nepal.\nSingapore's former trade and transport minister, S. Iswaran, received a 12-month prison sentence for obstructing justice and accepting $300,000 in gifts, marking the first time an ex-cabinet member has been jailed in Singapore's history.\nKite flying in Kathmandu Valley was a vibrant tradition dating back to the Malla era, with a peak in popularity during Dashain, featuring fighters competing to cut each other's lines and spectators enjoying the spectacle.\nMonsoon devastation in Nepal has heightened the risk of disease outbreaks, with experts warning of a potential surge in water-borne, vector-borne, and air-borne infections due to contaminated water sources and displaced living conditions.\nAs the festive season approaches, prices of daily essentials like rice, edible oil, legumes, and lentils have increased.Retailers say food prices are expected to stay high throughout Dashain and Tihar, Nepal’s biggest festivals.In Nepal, food prices are heavily influenced by the Indian market. Even though prices have not increased in India, some opportunist traders have been taking advantage of the poor market monitoring to increase prices under different pretexts. For example, on September 14, India raised the basic import tax on crude and refined edible oils by 20 percent. Nepali importers seized this opportunity to hike their prices even though Nepal had not raised the import tax.Dhurba Prasad Adhikari, joint treasurer of the Nepal Retailers Association, said Nepali wholesalers and retailers have already raised the prices. “It has been a week since edible oil price was increased by Rs20 per litre and the price is expected to increase further as the festive demand kicks in,” he said. But he admits that market rumours and weak inspections make prices more unstable, especially during the festive season when demand is at its peak.According to the association, sunflower oil prices have increased from Rs190 to Rs210 per litre. Likewise, the per litre price of mustard oil has gone up from Rs350 to Rs370.Adhikari, who operates Adhikari Khadya Store, said the price of edible oil is expected to increase in Tihar due to high demand.Retailers said strict inspections in large trading houses could help stabilise prices during the festive season. Consumer rights activists say the current government inspections of the market are just for show and will not address issues related to price, quality, and quantity.“The government’s market inspection body is looking only at retail markets. They, too, know this will not change prices unless they also inspect the warehouses of large importers and traders,” Adhikari said. He said that the government inspecting body needs to check on the stock of goods held by traders.According to retailers, even with the new rice harvesting beginning soon, prices of the staple have increased by Rs100 kg for a 25 kg bag.Even the price of sona mansuli, which normally remains at Rs60 per kg, has now inched up to Rs70 to Rs75 per kg.Rice prices, however, are expected to decline after the arrival of the new harvest.Sugar is now being sold at Rs120 per kg and expected to rise further, retailers said.As private sector traders say they are out of sugar stock and both state supply utilities—the Salt Trading Corporation and the Food Management and Trading Company—have delayed opening the tender to import the sweetener, according to market insiders, the price is expected to cross Rs160 per kg by Tihar.However, retailers said the jeera (cumin seed) price has declined. But the price could still go up in the next two weeks.Last year during Dashain, the price of jeera, an indispensable spice, spiked from Rs1,400 to Rs1,500 per kg. The price has declined, and it is being transacted around Rs950 per kg this year, Adhikari said. Prices of lentils and legumes tend to fluctuate based on international production, but have remained high in recent months.According to the association, pulses have reached Rs180 per kg from Rs175 per kg.Adhikari said food prices have been increasing every year. “The rice prices are so high that people are buying only what they need in smaller quantities,” said Adhikari.“The government needs to intervene in the market, particularly inspect the large traders engaged in unscrupulous market activities,” said Prem Lal Maharjan, president of the National Consumer Forum. “Proper inspection will help bring the prices down. It will also help the government bring in more revenues,” he said.As the government has started operating fair-price shops across the country, there might be some relief for consumers, Maharjan said. “But such subsidised shops should be operated year-round to control market prices.”    \nUS Ambassador Dean Richard Thompson reflects on his Nepal tenure, highlighting key events and developments: Nepal's democratic elections, bilateral relations, US assistance projects including MCC, geopolitical competition with China, US-Nepal military cooperation, the Indo-Pacific Strategy, transitional justice progress, the need for American FDI, and trade talks.\nHere’s what Prime Minister KP Oli told the parliament on Monday, saying he was giving the address for a “special” reason: “Nepal wants to maintain neighbourly relations as a good neighbour, not a petty, scheming neighbour…Nepal wants a similar behaviour on the part of its neighbours.”He pursued this line of argument, implying that India is wishing ill on Nepal, imposing on Nepal’s sovereignty and interfering in its independent status and policy. He then told the parliament that he would present the issue at the United Nations General Assembly.It basically amounts to saying he will complain to the UN about India’s behaviour. What a petty idea.Given his inherent character trait, PM Oli will find it difficult to develop trusted relations with India in the short term. His only option is to be diplomatic, predictable and consistent. So far, he’s not been able to do that. It does not bode well for Nepal’s foreign policy, which is the most important means of pursuing Nepal’s current priorities, including jobs, growth and climate change.Calculated relations Oli’s statement in the parliament indicates at least three things. First, his expectations from India have not been fulfilled. Second, his communications with the country have broken down. And third, he thinks India may be working to undermine his political authority.Let’s look at his expectations from the southern neighbour. Oli wants to hold high-level talks with PM Modi of India and build trusted relations.In the past two weeks, media reports and opinion pieces have discussed whether Oli would be invited to India or not. It has almost become customary in Nepal for a new prime minister to visit India first before embarking on other high-level visits. Such a custom indicates the value politicians accord to India, especially if they want their government to be stable.The second indication is that Oli is finding it difficult to communicate with people who matter in India. When you begin to communicate your feelings about India through the media, it indicates that your direct communications have either broken down or are ineffective.Behind Oli’s statement is an obvious intention to play the blame game or rally the public. India may be at fault for many things, but blaming India does not absolve him of inconsistencies on his part or the sheer inability to conduct diplomacy in a dignified manner.The third indication is even more significant. Oli has consistently promoted anti-Indian nationalism, and India finds it difficult to trust him. But would that alone be enough to undermine his government?Throughout history, India has had a significant influence on Nepal’s political process and decision-making. Through its influence on individuals who’ve received gifts, benefits, and resources, some at the highest levels, India holds significant leverage over political decision-making and, by extension, over policies and processes.An old playbookIndia’s calculated relations with the Nepali state came to the fore in August this year when Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba visited India. New Delhi turned her visit into a high-profile affair even though she was unprepared to represent Nepal’s interests. Her visit, rather than building political trust, ended up creating more mistrust between Oli and New Delhi as well as between the Foreign Ministry and the Prime Minister’s Office.Although it is a matter of speculation, there are strong grounds to argue that such a courtesy would not have been extended to someone from the CPN (UML). It generates the question, at least in the public’s mind, whether India accorded special treatment to FM Rana as a “special” individual who happened to be the foreign minister and not as a representative of Nepal.Whether real or not, the perception that India is unhappy with Oli has fuelled the notion that the current government coalition is unstable.Throughout Nepal’s modern history, whenever top leaders are forced out, they tend to seek India’s support to regain power. I have heard firsthand from top political leaders that India used to put a pre-condition: First, demonstrate that you have people's support, then we will use our leverage to help you. Thus, the political leaders would launch a political campaign and hold mass meetings throughout the country. If the broader political environment favoured a political change, then India made the additional push.Now, as Pushpa Kamal Dahal tours the country, blaming a corrupt network of power brokers, we are reminded of this old playbook. During mass meetings, an embittered Dahal frequently alleges that “middlemen, brokers, and big cronies have gotten together, and with the strength of so-called numbers, have tried to strangle truth, justice…and good governance.” He also tells the public that his government was ousted because the investigations on corruption were leading to Budhanilkantha (Deuba’s residence) and Balkot (Oli’s residence).Oli’s inherent anti-Indian streakFor Oli, an inherent anti-Indian streak in his psychological make-up and an affinity with the Communist Party of China makes rapprochement with India difficult.In the last 10 years, Oli has made countless petty statements intended to rile and irritate India. He has also accorded China greater space in Nepal.In his book, former deputy PM Kamal Thapa expresses distaste at the way Oli made an unscheduled visit to China Gezhouba Group Corporation and disappeared for one and a half hours for a private meeting with Chinese Communist Party officials during his visit to China in 2016.Another issue is the Eminent Persons’ Group report, which Oli raised during the launch of Thapa’s book. “It would be good to receive the report,” he said during the programme. He made more anti-Indian remarks at another similar event.At present, any talk of the EPG report is viewed as an irritant by India, because it has consistently sent a clear diplomatic message that the report is dead. The unwillingness of a section of the Nepali populace to accept the message, including the CPN-UML, has not gone well in India.In a recent discussion programme, a former ambassador of India to Nepal indicated that the EPG report had become a new irritant in Nepal-India relations. He said that instead of insisting on the acceptance of the report, Nepal could pursue the individual issues identified. Trends in the last two decades indicate that instead of really trying to address the outstanding issues in Nepal-India relations, Nepali leaders are just interested in politicising them and gaining personal mileage.Nepal’s relationship with India has become more and more of a paradox. Nepal’s dominant ethno-nationalism is anti-Indian. Indeed, Nepal has many unresolved issues with India, but it’s economic development hinges on closer connectivity with India, which in turn hinges on trusted political relationships and ability to untangle complex issues.Snubbed by India, Oli is now headed to the US, where he could still get to meet a lukewarm Modi. He hopes to gain stature and make an impression at several forums including the UNGA, where he is scheduled to deliver speeches. We can only wish our PM well. \nFive years ago, on September 30, 2019, when KP Sharma Oli was prime minister for the second time, the government declared the entire country open-defecation free amid much fanfare. However, years later, thousands of people from across the country are getting infected with diarrheal diseases, including scores from cholera.Rautahat is among the nine districts reporting cholera outbreaks this year. Ward 4 of Rajpur Municipality has reported over 100 cases of diarrheal infection and hospitalisation. However, the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division said only 12 people from the municipality had so far contracted cholera.“Over 100 diarrheal patients from the municipality’s ward 4 have been hospitalised,” Khusid Ahmad, a health worker at the municipality, told the Post over the phone from Rautahat. “Contaminated drinking water could be the culprit for the cholera outbreak there. Samples of drinking water collected from affected areas have been sent for lab tests.”Apart from Rautahat, eight other districts—Lalitpur, Kathmandu, Kailali, Pyuthan, Makawanpur, Rolpa, Sindhupalchok, and Achham—have also reported cholera outbreaks this year. So far, the number of diarrheal patients who have contracted cholera is 95. Interestingly, most of the districts that have witnessed outbreaks of deadly cholera this year had years ago been declared open defecation-free.The Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool samples of the infected patients. Doctors say that detected cases of cholera infection could be just the tip of the iceberg, as most positive cases are being reported from the districts with active surveillance.Public health experts say outbreaks of cholera in multiple districts, even five years after the country was declared open defecation-free, show a huge gap between official declarations and progress on the ground.They say outbreaks of diarrheal diseases, including cholera, are directly linked to drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene conditions, and the country was declared open defecation-free without improving water and sanitation conditions.“Without ensuring the quality of drinking water and sanitation, among other things, authorities rushed to declare the entire country free from open defecation,” said Dr Mingmar Gyelgen Sherpa, former director general at the Department of Health Services. “Instead of improving basic water and sanitation infrastructure, we’ve focussed too much on outbreak management, and this is the wrong approach.”Even though toilets have been built in most households, open defecation is still widespread in many places. Drinking water samples collected from various parts of the country, including from the districts of the Kathmandu Valley, have been found contaminated with faecal coliform, which means the water the public uses for drinking is unsafe. The presence of faecal coliform, a microscopic organism that thrives in the intestines of warm-blooded animals or their faeces, indicates sewage contamination in the drinking water, according to doctors.A previous study had shown that 81 percent of water samples collected in the Kathmandu Valley were contaminated with deadly microbes.“We only focussed on expanding coverage of drinking water but did not pay attention to ensuring its safety,” said Dr Meghnath Dhimal, chief researcher at the Nepal Health Research Council. “Authorities concerned must also focus on improving the quality.”Experts say improving public hygiene is essential to ensuring water quality and avoiding diarrheal ailments. Awareness drives and health education play a crucial role in changing behaviours, which requires years of investment and continuous efforts.Along with investment in health education, attention should go to building climate-resilient infrastructures for drinking water and sanitation, as water resources have been contaminated by floodwaters in many districts. The effects of climate change have increased adverse events, including floods, which in turn have contaminated the source of drinking water, making people vulnerable to infection with diarrheal ailments.“Multiple agencies of the three tiers of government and non-governmental sectors have to make more effort to prevent diarrhoea outbreaks,” said Sherpa. “But there seems to be a lack of coordination among government agencies.” The World Health Organisation also stresses on a multifaceted approach as a key to controlling cholera and reducing deaths. \n\nRae was the envoy to Kathmandu during the promulgation of the 2015 constitution and the subsequent blockade. In this conversation, Rae talks about the evolution of Nepal-India ties since the blockade, regional geopolitics, what the two countries get wrong about each other, how New Delhi views Nepali communist parties and the governments they lead, and the change (if any) in India’s neighbourhood policy since the start of Narendra Modi’s third term in office. \nKunwar has been the MD for just under three years. Before coming back to her homeland to join Daraz Nepal, she worked at different American companies, including Amazon, the world’s biggest e-commerce platform. In this conversation, Kunwar talks about the opportunities and challenges of running an e-commerce enterprise in Nepal, as well as the country’s overall business environment.  \nWhen the Ranjitkar group was established, they discovered this forgotten dance and devoted two years to researching it.Now, they are reintroducing it during Indra Jatra by training the new generation in this traditional art form. \nI first met Louisa Kamal at my college, where she was invited as one of the trainers for a News Writing Workshop. Dressed simply, she captivated me with her eloquent command of language. As the minutes stretched into hours, I learned she hailed from the UK but had spent over half her life in Asia, including Thailand, Japan, and Nepal. She taught English literature for many years at government universities in Thailand and Japan.Two of her books, ‘A Rainbow of Chaos’ (2023) and ‘Rainbows in the Eyes’ (2024), further deepened my admiration for her. A graduate of Manchester University with a degree in literature, Kamal is working on her third book, ‘For Every Storm, A Rainbow’.In this conversation with the Post’s Sanskriti Pokharel, Kamal discusses her literary journey and books that comfort her during difficult times. What initially drew you to writing?Books have been in my home since childhood, and I have a special affinity for literature ever since. I used to sit on my mother’s lap, and she read children’s literature to me. She encouraged me to listen to her reading and then gradually read myself. This marked the beginning of my journey into literature. As I grew up, I couldn't imagine my life without books. Consequently, I earned my BA in English Language and Literature and an MA in Later Victorian and Edwardian Literature from the University of Manchester. It’s always been a dream of mine to be a published author, but life and the need to earn money have always gotten in the way. When I came to Nepal in 2020, and the lockdown halted my movement, it was the first time I had time on my hands. I started to write a diary to structure my life.Once I started writing, the flow became incessant. The diary eventually became my first book, ‘A Rainbow of Chaos’, followed by the second, ‘Rainbows in the Eyes’, not to mention articles on various subjects related to Nepal’s rich culture. The day is wasted if I don’t develop a few article ideas or write a few thousand words.As an author and photographer, have you ever found that capturing a scene with your lens helps articulate a written story or vice versa?Absolutely! Photography enhances my writing process. While I’m not a technical photographer, many say my photographs capture emotions and feelings. My fascination with Nepali festivals and jatras inspires me to document vibrant celebrations. The crowd during festivals give me no time to make notes, so my photos document the experience. When I revisit them, they enable me to articulate my stories. So, for me, photography and storytelling are intertwined.Can you discuss any particular literary works that inspired your two books?Colin Thubron's ‘To a Mountain in Tibet’ and Peter Matthiessen's ‘The Snow Leopard’ were two books that subconsciously influenced me when I polished my books into final forms. These books have been influential as they push the boundaries of 'travel' writing. Thubron and Matthiessen 'travel' into their souls while journeying to Kailash and Shey (Dolpa), respectively. I admire the sensitivity and richness of their language, which inspired me.My two books describe my and Nepal’s struggle to come to terms with the lockdown. Therefore, some parts of them describe cultural issues and specific locations. However, at their core, they narrate my emotional and spiritual journey as I gather the courage to start anew in Nepal. Thubron and Matthiessen helped me embrace a broader perspective, allowing me to introduce new themes in my writing. They also inspired me to think more expansively and not limit my experiences while writing. Has your reading taste evolved as you’ve lived and worked across different cultures?Definitely. Living in Manchester with my mother was limiting in some ways, as she was strict. Studying in an all-girls school made my childhood conservative as well. During that time, my interest in literature was traditional, too, and I was drawn to 19th—and 20th-century literature penned by the Bronte sisters, Thomas Hardy, Jane Austen, and others. When I moved to Japan in September 1989, I was captivated by Haikus. I also won a few competitions with the haikus I composed. As my life has taken me to different Asian countries, I have subconsciously come to value novels by Indian writers. Nowadays, I feel that the beauty of the language penned by most modern British authors has faded. But I find much taste in Indian writers, like Amitabh Gosh and Arundhati Roy. In your four-decade-long career across Asia, have any literary works helped you navigate the challenges of adapting to new cultures?When I feel homesick and stressed, I turn to the books I read as a child, such as Frances Hodgson Burnett’s ‘The Secret Garden’ and Edith Nesbit’s ‘The Railway Children.’ There have been times when I wanted to let everything go, revert to my baseline, and reconnect with my inner child. Those children’s classics have soothed my soul and soled me during those times.

Krishna Prasad Paudel, chief secretary at the party office, says many central leaders have already reached the districts they are assigned to run campaign activities.According to Paudel, the party’s seven joint general secretaries lead the campaign in the seven provinces. Senior leaders Krishna Sitaula, Shashank Koirala, Bimalendra Nidhi, and Bijaya Kumar Gachhadar, along with some central committee leaders, have either reached the assigned districts or are on the way, Paudel said.“When the party’s senior leaders and central committee members are in their districts, vice presidents and general secretaries of the party will monitor the campaign activities,” Paudel told the Post. “If necessary, the vice presidents, the general secretaries, and the party president will go to some districts.”One of the main objectives of the campaign is to renew party membership. “We claim our party has 0.9 million members,” Paudel said. “During the campaign, leaders will check the trend of party members renewing their membership.”The campaign has been launched at a time when leaders have already started to devise their plans for the next general convention. As per the Congress statute, the party must hold its general convention every four years. The party’s 14th general convention was held in December 2021. If the statute is followed, the party’s next convention should be convened by the end of 2025.Some Congress leaders have floated the proposal of contesting the next general election on its own, without forging electoral alliance with other parties. General Secretary Gagan Thapa floated a proposal to this effect at the Mahasamiti meeting in February that forwarded the proposal to the central committee to take a decision on the issue.“If we are to fight elections on our own [without an alliance], we need a strong organisation, therefore the party is emphasising strengthening the party by conducting campaigns,” Paudel told the Post.But, for the party leaders, success of the campaign will largely depend on the way it will be run.“Will the party leaders try to connect the party organisation to the public or will they conduct it in just a traditional manner? This will determine the success of the campaign,” Guru Ghimire, a Congress leader, told the Post.Ghimire suggested that the party leaders should also gauge the strengths and weaknesses of other parties in the districts.Ghimire also advised the leaders not to use the campaign as an opportunity to promote factional activities.When public disenchantment towards the major parties is growing fast, the campaign the Congress has decided to carry forward could be a means to connect the leaders with the public, says a Congress leader.“This campaign will re-energise the relations between the party and the public, and the party should work hard to make this event fruitful without baggage of internal factions,” Sanjay Kumar Gautam, a Congress lawmaker, told the Post.Reconnecting with the public is a compulsion for the political parties, say political experts. Soon after the November 2022 election, major political parties including the Congress held several campaigns to reconnect with the people but the masses may not be quite impressed by the leaders’ announcements they make during the rallies unless they deliver when in power. Earlier, the CPN-UML carried out various drives such as ‘mission grassroots’, a march along Mid-Hill Highway. “Political parties’ efforts to get connected with the people is something commendable in itself,” Geja Sharma Wagle, a political analyst close to the Congress, told the Post. “But, if the political parties don’t deliver while they are in government, people might not be convinced by their pledges.”Wagle adds that as the Congress is in government, people take the leaders’ speeches seriously only if they work for them sincerely.During the 100-day campaign, the party has decided to inform the party members and local leaders regarding the seven-point agreement reached between the Congress and the CPN-UML on July 1. Based on the same agreement, the two parties formed the coalition government led by UML chair KP Sharma Oli on July 15. As per the deal, Oli will hand over the government leadership to Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba after two years.Besides their power-sharing in the federal government, the Congress and the UML have shared powers in provincial governments as well. While Koshi, Lumbini and Karnali provincial governments are led by the UML, Congress provincial lawmakers head Bagmati, Gandaki, and Sudurpaschim governments. The two big parties have backed Janamat Party to head the provincial government in Madhesh.During a meeting of the coalition partners held in Singha Durbar on September 9, Prime Minister Oli had reportedly complained that the coalition partners did not work enough to counter the ‘disinformation campaign of the opposition parties’ against the Oli government. “The opposition has spread confusion about the government, but the parties in government have not shown any interest in countering the disinformation,” the prime minister had reportedly said at the meeting. “All the ruling partners should defend the government.”Congress leaders will inform the party’s district representatives about the spirit of collaboration with the UML, constitutional amendments, and other issues. They are also responsible for informing the party members at the grassroots about policies such as the common minimum programme.Earlier this month, the Congress-UML coalition brought the programme that has, among other things, reiterated its commitment to reviewing the achievements made and weaknesses observed in the course of implementing the constitution in the past nine years. \nAfter being ousted from government for the first time in nine years, the CPN (Maoist Centre) appears to be at a turning point as it seeks to redefine its vision of socialism. In the wake of consultative meetings in seven provinces and its foreign units, party leaders have stressed the need for fresh ideas based on the party’s historic Chunwang meeting of 2005 that adopted ‘democratic republicanism’.Until this July, the party has continuously been in power since the promulgation of the constitution in 2015. Back during the insurgency days, the meeting held at Chunwang in Rukum district had endorsed the party’s political line advocating for promulgating a constitution through a constituent assembly. On this basis, the party in 2006 signed the Comprehensive Peace Accord with the then seven-party alliance and laid down arms to enter mainstream politics.The 2015 constitution envisions Nepal as a socialism-oriented country, with the Maoist Centre playing a key role in shaping that direction. But why, after all these years, is the party revisiting the question of socialism?Maoist Centre spokesman, Agni Sapkota, argues that the party has been discussing socialism in various forums. “But this time, we want a more intense and focussed discussion.” Tensions within the party also came to light during the party’s standing committee meeting in August where office bearers openly questioned the leadership of Pushpa Kamal Dahal. In response, the party decided to hold consultative meetings in all provinces to discuss the matter. Besides the provincial meetings, the party also consulted its foreign branches known as ‘pradesh committees’ in India, West Asia, and Eurasia.According to Sapkota, the Maoist Centre leadership got three mandates at the consultative meetings that concluded on September 20.“Besides the need for discussion on party ideology, the consultative meetings’ mandates include improving organisational management and updating party statute, changing leaders’ behaviour, and improving their secretariat work,” Sapkota told the Post. Likewise, another party leader, Dor Prasad Upadhyaya, says democratic socialism naturally aligns with the ideology of the Nepali Congress, whereas ‘people’s multiparty democracy’ is the ideology of the CPN-UML. “As for the Maoist Center, we lack a distinct political ideology clearly reflecting the party’s vision.”Although the party claims its ideology is ‘people’s democracy of the 21st century’, party leaders admit that its impact is diluted by lack of commitment. Party leaders said that there was no call for a leadership change during the consultative meetings. However, at the standing committee meeting in August, a deputy general secretary of the party, Janardan Sharma, submitted a 14-page document calling for a change in party leadership.Sharma and Barsha Man Pun—another deputy general secretary of the Maoist party—urged Dahal to pass over party reins to new generation leaders. According to leaders, some within the party feel that Dahal should not leave a leadership vacuum until a clear plan for leadership transition is in place.Likewise, Ram Karki, the party’s secretary, says the consultative meetings were focussed at preparing a political document that would be presented at the central committee meeting in November. “The consultative meetings were focused on the party’s diminishing influence in national politics,” Karki told the Post. “Despite our party leaders who were in government claiming that they did an excellent job, why hasn’t that reflected in the party’s life? This was a major concern expressed during the meetings.”Karki said the meeting also directed the party to remain open for cooperation with other parties with socialist inclinations. When asked about possible cooperation with the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), Karki dismissed the idea. “Lately, there have been some points of agreement between the two parties. But, I don’t see any prospect of the two parties getting into a working partnership,” Karki said. “The consultative meetings have said the party leadership is open to cooperation with socialist parties except the RSP.”The RSP—which was one of the junior partners in the immediate past government led by Maoist Centre chief Dahal before the government was toppled on July 12—appears to be on the same page with the Maoist Centre on many issues lately. But the two parties rule out cooperation on the political front.Party spokesperson Sapkota also says that his party can cooperate with the RSP in parliament on issues of public interest, but there is no possibility of forging a working alliance with the party. RSP chair Rabi Lamichhane, who presented his political document at the party's first national conference held for two days in Kathmandu earlier this month, also hinted at potential cooperation with like-minded parties. Despite this, RSP leaders declined cooperation with the Maoist Centre. The Maoist Centre’s consultative meetings have suggested that the party consider unification with other parties in order to revitalise the communist movement, Sapkota added.  \nThe Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), the fourth largest in Parliament, is fiercely resisting what it claims are government moves to arrest its chair, Rabi Lamichhane, over allegations of his involvement in cooperatives fraud. But all the other national parties seem to be in favour of his prosecution. Among the seven national parties in Parliament, there is a growing consensus for holding Lamichhane accountable. A party needs to win at least one FPTP seat and get three percent proportional representation votes to get national party status.Ruling coalition partners such as the Nepali Congress, the CPN-UML, Ashok Rai’s Janata Samajbadi Party, and the Janamat Party believe that RSP chair Lamichhane should face the law. Additionally, the CPN (Maoist Centre), the main opposition in Parliament, along with the Rastriya Prajantra Party and Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal (JSP-Nepal), both of which are outside the coalition, also support the parliamentary probe’s findings and advocate action against Lamichhane. The CPN (Unified Socialist), which is not a national party but has 10 seats in the lower house, has also joined the ranks of parties that want Lamichhane prosecuted. “Our party believes that, as a matter of principle, no innocent should be punished, and no guilty evade the law,” says the Maoist Centre Secretary Devendra Paudel.On the probe panel’s findings, Paudel said, “Evidence suggests that Lamichhane misused cooperative funds,” Paudel told the Post. “He should be held accountable for his actions as per the law.” A source close to Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak while talking to the Post said, “If everything goes as planned, the police will arrest Lamichhane soon.”However, during a recent interview with Kantipur Television’s Fireside program, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the chairman of the Maoist Centre, was noncommittal on whether Lamichhane should be prosecuted for misusing cooperative funds.But party secretary Paudel said his party would take a stand against Lamichhane’s misuse of cooperative funds.Unified Socialist spokesperson Jagannath Khatiwada says that the probe panel’s recommendations should be implemented. “Although our party has yet to take an official position on it, I can say that our leaders are discussing the parliamentary probe report and there is a general consensus that the report’s recommendations should be implemented.”“The report suggests that the government should further investigate and prosecute four key people [Rabi Lamichhane, GB Rai, Chhabi Joshi, and Kumar Ramtel] involved in the misuse of multiple cooperative funds, and our party supports the report,” Khatiwada told the Post. “Those proven guilty should be booked under the prevailing laws.” While Rai is on the run, Ramtel is in judicial custody of Kaski police. After arresting Joshi, Police are now waiting for the government’s green light to arrest Lamichhane, who has twice served as deputy prime minister and home minister.The Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal (JSP-Nepal), led by Upendra Yadav, also views Lamichhane as culpable in the misuse of the cooperative funds and disputes the RSP’s claim that he got a clean chit from the parliamentary special probe. “Our party does not want to disrespect any political leaders as such, but that does not mean a guilty individual should escape legal repercussions,” Manish Kumar Suman, the party central spokesperson, told the Post. “The report clearly indicates Lamichhane’s involvement in misusing cooperative funds, so there is no question of him getting a clear chit, unlike what the RSP leaders claim.” Rastriya Prajatantra Party Vice President Dhruba Bahadur Pradhan says the parliamentary probe panel, which investigated crisis-ridden cooperatives, has done its job and submitted a report and now it is the government’s responsibility to act on the recommendations.“As for our party’s position, Lamichhane should be prosecuted under the prevailing laws, as per the special committee’s report,” Pradhan told the Post. Lamichhane is accused of siphoning funds from multiple cooperatives to run the Gorkha Media Network, which operated the Galaxy 4k Television channel. The channel shut down last year. Chairman GB (Gitendra Babu) Rai and managing director Lamichhane jointly ran the media company before Lamichhane quit it to join politics in June 2022. On September 16, the parliamentary special committee submitted its report to Speaker Ghimire, who forwarded it to the government on the same day. On September 19, the Cabinet owned the report and ordered responsible ministries to act based on its findings. The probe panel’s report does not directly implicate Lamichhane in rerouting cooperative funds into the media, but it does label him guilty of using cooperative funds for Gorkha Media Network. The panel has recommended that the government prosecute Lamichhane; his business partner Rai; one of the founders of Gorkha Media Company, Chhabi Joshi; and board member Kumar Ramtel. As the panel report could not establish a direct link between Lamichhane and the rerouting of cooperative funds, RSP leaders interpret it as a ‘clean chit’ for their party chief. But leaders from other parties reject this claim.“The way RSP leaders are trying to interpret the probe panel’s report is distortion,” Pradhan said.Based on the report, the crime division of Nepal Police arrested Joshi, former deputy inspector general of Nepal Police and one of the founders of Gorkha Media Network, on the orders of Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak on Sunday. Following this, RSP chair Lamichhane organised a gathering of party sympathisers at his office to condemn the government amid rumours of his impending arrest. While addressing supporters at the RSP headquarters in Balaju, Kathmandu on Sunday evening, he urged them to be prepared to defend their new political force, claiming that a plan was afoot to ‘finish Rabi Lamichhane and the Rastriya Swatantra Party.’The erstwhile main opposition party, Nepali Congress, had continuously disrupted the parliamentary proceedings for over two months demanding a probe into the cooperatives scam, especially its connections to the Gorkha Media Network. In response, the immediate past government led by Maoist Centre chair Dahal had formed the parliamentary special probe panel.  \nRepresentatives at the first national conference of the Rastriya Swatantra Party saw factionalism within the party.Some of the representatives who arrived in Kathmandu three days ago for the two-day gathering starting on Tuesday said that growing factionalism is not healthy for the new political outfit promising to challenge traditional forces like the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML.“We were told that factionalism existed in our party in various forms, but we denied such claims. However, during our three days in Kathmandu, we witnessed it,” a group of party members told the Post. It seems that President Rabi Lamichhane and Vice-president Swarnim Wagle are not in the same boat on how the party should function, they added.RSP acting spokesperson Manish Jha explains that it is the lack of synchronisation—rather than differences—between the leaders. “People from various schools of thought came together to form the RSP. It is true that we lack synchronisation, but it would be wrong to portray it as differences.”Another leader of the party said on condition of anonymity that the party has two schools of thought—one based on democratic principles and the other opposed to it.RSP acting general secretary Kabindra Burlakoti claims that the party is united.In conversations with the Post, representatives from Kathmandu Valley, Pokhara and Chitwan sounded more optimistic with the central leadership while those from remote areas were confused over their take on the party’s central leadership.The representatives from Madhesh were mild in their opinion about the leadership.Moreover, representatives were also not very positive about the way the central leadership is investing their energy to claim that Lamichhane had got a clean chit from the parliamentary special committee formed to investigate crisis-ridden cooperatives.The probe panel, which submitted its report to the House of Representatives, has recommended the government prosecute Lamichhane, along with his former business partner GB (Gitendra Babu) Rai, board member of the media Kumar Ramtel and initial founder Chhabi Lal Joshi as per the prevailing laws. The inquiry committee, however, has said it couldn’t establish Lamichhane’s role in rerouting the cooperatives fund to Gorkha Media Network.“It would have been better had the central leadership waited to see how the government would take action,” the group of representatives from western Nepal told the Post. “In case Lamichhane is booked under the law, it could be counterproductive for the party in the long run.”The political campaign started by the RSP won’t get stalled even without Lamichhane, the representatives said, expressing their confidence in the party’s longevity.Lamichhane also presented a political report incorporating proposed statutory changes, the party’s commitments to voters, policy agenda presented by Swarnim Wagle at the Jaleshwar meeting and the conclusion drawn from the closed session of the national conference.Lamichhane’s report states that the policy paper presented in Jaleshwar defined ‘constitutional socialism’ as the party’s political ideology. Lamichhane also accuses the ruling Nepali Congress and CPN-UML of trying to lead the country to a two-party system by polarising smaller parties. “On the pretext of administrative reform, they are planning to wipe out the existence of small parties,” the report reads. “Potentially, this step can bring together new parties that want to be an alternative political force sooner or later.”Asked about RSP’s possible alliance with other parties, Burlakoti said though they are not in talks with the main opposition CPN (Maoist Centre), they are in regular contact with several independent candidates of last election.Asked if they are in discussion with Kathmandu Metropolitan City Mayor Balendra Shah, who won the 2022 local election independently, Burlakoti said: “Strategic moves are not to be disclosed.”However, when the national conference concluded after Lamichhane presented his report, representatives arriving from around the country were displeased.“This is not the way a party functions,” a representative told the Post, asking not to be named for fears of reprisal.When leaders put themselves at the centre and cadres in the periphery, the party’s downfall begins, another representative said. Acting General Secretary Burlakoti, however, defended the party leadership. “Our national conference was designed this way,” Burlakoti said. The report presented by the chair will be discussed in the party’s Mahakali-Mechi campaign that will start soon, he added.“At the national conference, we gave 5 percent of the total representatives (1500) time to speak, but those who spoke exceeded that number,” Burlakoti said.The conference, however, passed Lamichhane’s report. On Wednesday, Lamichhane announced the date of the party’s first general convention. It will be held on May 8-10 at a yet-undecided venue.“I would like to inform you that the Central Committee has become the general convention organising committee,” Burlakoti said. Lamichhane also announced the ‘Mahakali-Mechi Campaign’ to interact with the general public.In his report, Lamichhane has proposed a person not affiliated to any party to be elected the country’s president, directly elected executive head, or the prime minister. He also proposes giving the nation’s vice president the responsibility to chair the National Assembly.While the paper bats for a fully proportional electoral system, it says provincial assemblies cannot be accepted in the current shape.However, this does not mean the RSP is against the federal structure gained through the sacrifice of thousands of people, another representative said. “Our party has no strength to amend the constitution and scrap the federal structure. Therefore, for the time being, voices are growing among the party members about accepting the present political structure,” Khemraj Koirala, a conference representative from Kailali told the Post.Party members also suggested downsizing the number of ministers to make the provincial system functional, Koirala said.The report also stands for reducing the number of municipalities to less than 500, from the current 753. \nThe coalition government of the CPN-UML and the Nepali Congress has reiterated its commitment to review the achievements made and weaknesses observed in the course of implementing the constitution in the past nine years.The two ruling parties have pledged to amend the constitution based on a broader understanding made through discussions, dialogues and consultations with political parties, civil society, intelligentsia, constitutional experts and the public.The parties have said such amendments will be made mainly based on the findings of the review and experiences of implementing it. Moreover, the parties said that establishing political stability in the country would be the major objective of the amendment.The two ruling parties made the commitments in the common minimum programme of the government, which was submitted to Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli and Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba on Wednesday evening. The parties had earlier formed a four-member panel to draft the government’s programme based on a seven-point agreement reached between the Congress and the UML in the first week of July. Party general secretary Gagan Thapa and spokesperson Prakash Sharan Mahat from Congress, and party deputy general secretaries Pradeep Gyawali and Bishnu Rimal from the CPN-UML were tasked to prepare the document. They jointly submitted the document to the two party chiefs and made it public.“The achievements of the 2006 movement and the fundamental pillars of this constitution including federal, republic and inclusive governance system will be further institutionalised and strengthened,” the document says.The seven-page document is divided into eight subtitles—safeguarding national interest and independent foreign policy; protection, implementation and amendment of the constitution; good governance and quality service delivery; dynamic economy and development; ensuring social justice and fundamental rights; youth partnership; transitional justice, sustainable peace and social harmony; and miscellaneous.The coalition has pledged to set up a high-powered cooperative regulatory body as per the recommendation of the parliamentary inquiry committee to address the problems seen in the cooperative sector.“Taking action against those involved in misusing funds from cooperatives, the return of depositors’ money will be ensured,” the common minimum programme states.The ruling parties have pledged to punish corrupt people irrespective of the individuals’ power and positions. On the economic front, the coalition has vowed to expedite generation and transmission of hydroelectricity and further intensify the electrification process. \nTicket bookings for public transport during the Dashain festival will open this Saturday. Following discussions with stakeholders, the Department of Transport Management announced that tickets will be available online and at counters to manage the expected surge of nearly two million travellers leaving the Kathmandu Valley for the festivities.According to the department’s Director General, Rajiv Pokharel, transport operators will facilitate online bookings. “We have instructed operators to arrange online bookings wherever possible,” he said. “For counter bookings, passengers must obtain tickets only from official staff wearing uniforms and identification badges.”Around two million people are estimated to leave the Kathmandu Valley during Dashain. The department has introduced 20-point directives to ensure safe and hassle-free travel. Key measures include mandatory checks for alcohol consumption by drivers at major entry and exit points and the requirement for two drivers on long-distance routes. Additionally, those under 18 cannot work as assistant drivers.To assist travellers during Dashain, Tihar, and Chhath festivals, citizen help desks will be established at major locations such as Nagdhunga, Kalanki, Swayambhu, Halchowk, Machhapokhari, Gongabu Bus Park, Chabahil, Tilganga, Koteshwar, Jagati, Satdobato, Balkhu, Dakshinkali, Sundhara, and Sangha in Kavre. An inspection team comprising officials from various agencies will monitor travel arrangements with support from provincial transport ministries.Public transport operating on long and medium-distance routes must follow a designated queue system. Transport expert Ashish Gajurel noted that although bookings are open each year, passengers face difficulties. \"Bus operators don’t increase the number of buses during Dashain, despite rising demand. Authorities must increase the number of buses to ease travel,\" he said.Saroj Sitaula, senior vice-president of the Federation of Nepalese National Transport Entrepreneurs, however, argued that ‘unnecessary’ vehicle checks should be avoided to prevent inconvenience for passengers and drivers. He also highlighted the need to repair potholes on roads to ensure smooth travel.Earlier, Minister for Physical Infrastructure and Transport Devendra Dahal instructed the Department of Roads to complete road repairs nationwide before Ghatasthapana, the first day of the 15-day Dashain festival. The department reported that repairs are underway but have been delayed by the monsoon.The Narayanghat-Butwal road section, part of the East-West Highway, remains a major concern, with only 52.7 percent of its upgrade completed after six years of construction and multiple deadline extensions. The Meteorological Forecasting Division of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology has predicted chances of rainfall in various places of the country for a couple of days more, raising concerns about travel difficulties during Dashain. Other problematic sections include Nagdhunga-Mugling and Mugling-Pokhara, with landslides and potholes reported along various highways, including the Mid-Hill, Madan Bhandari, Hulaki, and BP highways. \nPanic gripped locals in ward 12 of Chandragiri Municipality, Kathmandu, on Thursday morning after a suspicious object was found in the locality.The suspicious object was spotted in front of Balambu Secondary School, sparking fears of a bomb threat.Locals informed the police, and a bomb disposal team from the Nepal Army arrived at the scene. According to the NA Directorate of Public Relations and Information, the team disposed of the suspicious object, which turned out to be a pressure cooker.   \nKathmandu Metropolitan City has extended the area to prohibit building any structure on either side of the rivers in its territory.In a notice on Wednesday, the city office stated that construction of any structure has been barred on the additional 20 meters from the existing prohibited area.According to the metropolis notice, if the city has, under the existing rule, prohibited any construction on 20 meters from the area marked as river, the prohibited area will now be altogether 40 meters on either side of the waterway.The metropolis said the decision was taken based on a recent Supreme Court verdict that directed the authorities concerned to prohibit construction within an additional 20 metres from riverbanks in the Kathmandu Valley.Currently, construction is permitted only 20 metres beyond major riverbanks in the Kathmandu metropolis.The notice issued by the metropolis states, “No construction will be permitted on an additional 20 metres of land on either side of the river, and ongoing construction will be halted.”It has also asked one and all not to release contaminated water, including sewage, into Bagmati River and its tributaries. “Private and government buildings, as well as commercial properties, must install soak pits for groundwater recharge,” it said. “Waste must not be disposed of in the rivers. Non-compliance will lead to legal action under existing laws.” \nThe rhythmic beat of the Dha echoes through a Bhaktapur alley, blending with the energetic footsteps of dancers. Bhaktapur, which sees jatras and festivals round the year, is no stranger to music, dance and celebrations. But this is not an ordinary occasion. The performers in question are Lakhe dancers who are reviving the Ranjitkar Lakhe dance after a century.The young dancers are preparing for Indra Jatra this year, where mask-clad Lakhe dancers roam the streets to rid the community of hardships and suffering. Lakhe, demon deities revered as protectors of people and crops, are thought to reside in the demonic mask. As the dancer dons the mask, the spirit is said to take over.Bhaktapur was once a key site for the Ranjitkar Lakhe performances, but the art form vanished from the city after the 1934 earthquake.“Bhaktapur suffered the most damage during the 1934 earthquake,\" says Ganesh Ram Ranjit, treasurer of the Ranjitkar Group’s Bhaktapur branch. “The destruction left residents struggling to recover for a decade, making it nearly impossible to perform the costly Lakhe dance.”The Ranjitkar Group discovered the extinct dance in the year the group was established. They located a Lakhe temple in Bhaktapur that had closed after the earthquake. After two years of research, they learned that performing the Lakhe dance was seen as a good omen in Bhaktapur and involved hosting community feasts. However, the high cost of this tradition forced many to sell their properties, rendering it unfeasible in the city’s post-earthquake conditions. Over time, the dance was abandoned as more lands supporting these cultural events were lost during rapid urbanisation.“There was a significant decline in our engagement with our cultural heritage,” says Rabi Shakya, a sculptor and Lakhe dance teacher training the new dancers. “The encouraging change now is the strong interest from the new generation, which is making it possible to revive intangible heritage like this dance.”After 100 years, the Ranjitkar Lakhe Dance is making a return to Bhaktapur at this year’s Indra Jatra.“It’s challenging to accurately re-enact the dance since it hasn’t been seen in a century,” Shakya notes. “As a sculptor, I drew inspiration from Bhaktapur’s revered Shree Navadurga Bhawani to create the Lakhe’s mask.” Similarly, the dance was choreographed by studying Lakhe dances from Kathmandu, Patan, and Banepa within the Ranjitkar community, and combining them with traditional steps from Bhaktapur Lakhe dances.“As for the musical instruments, we are using traditional instruments like Dha, Dhime, and Ponga, which are said to excite the Lakhe,” says Rajendra Maharjan, Lakhe dance teacher and musician.Maharjan is one of the experienced Newari arts teachers working to revive the lost Lakhe dance. He is involved in training young students in cultural arts and is now dedicated to the Ranjitkar dance training, with the students practising together nearly every day.“Becoming a Lakhe performer involves more than just wearing the costume and mask,” said Sudin Ranjit, a Lakhe dance student. “We must train extensively with our teachers, and it demands a lot of hard work.”To Ranjit, a resident of Bhaktapur, the training is more than learning a new craft; it is a matter of protecting culture. Growing up only interested in instruments, he slowly understood how important continuing cultural practices like Lakhe dances is for their community.“The dance will not only bolster Bhaktapur’s cultural pride but also boost tourism and create jobs,” says Dr Purushottam Lochan Shrestha, a professor and researcher specialising in Bhaktapur and Newari culture.Shrestha notes that reviving the dance would offer employment to everyone involved, from the dancers and the sculptor making the masks to those participating in the rituals. “Economic centres throughout the city, from small businesses to large industries, will benefit from the influx of tourists attracted by the Lakhe dance,” Shrestha adds, commending the Ranjitkar group's initiative.Once the Ranjitkar community revitalises the Lakhe dance, the Ranjitkar group plans to set up a new Guthi house with a fresh community fund and organise annual events for the dance.“The Lakhe dance won’t let them separate,” Shakya remarks.In today’s globalised world, where identity often merges into a homogenised blend, shared cultural practices provide a sense of connection and belonging. This new Lakhe dance embodies that spirit of togetherness for the community involved.“Reviving the dance after 100 years,” Shakya says, “is about preserving our culture for the next 300 years.” \nThe Lions Club of Kathmandu Corporate, Nepal MD325-D has felicitated various personalities as part of its endeavour to recognise the contribution of the individuals and business entities for the society.As part of its campaign, the Lions Club of Kathmandu honoured Prateek Pradhan with Social Journalism Award, Sylapa T Rimponche with Social Spiritual Award, Erika Gurung with Social Player Award, Ramesh Corporation with Social Corporate House Award, Rajendra Malla with Social Corporate Leader Award and Rajesh Hamal with Social Celebrity Award.Likewise, Chandra Ghimire is honoured with Social Bureaucratic Award, Binod Das with Sports Management Award, Anil Kedia with Social Academic Award, Mohan Ojha with Social Management Award and Surya Nepal with Corporate Social Responsibility Award.The Lionism embarked in Nepal in 1971 as the Lions Club of Biratnagar under the stewardship of former Prime Minister Matrika Prasad Koirala.The Lions Clubs International says it has over 2,000 clubs operating across the nation. \nNepal's economic growth is projected to accelerate to 5.1 percent in the current fiscal year from 3.9 percent in the last fiscal year, driven by anticipated high tourist arrivals and increased hydropower and paddy production, according to the World Bank’s latest economic update, released on Wednesday.The Nepal Development Update: International Migration and Well-being in Nepal, which has not updated the losses incurred by late September rain disasters, said the private sector is expected to contribute to the country’s growth, as it is anticipated to benefit from the central bank’s loosening of monetary policy and easing of regulatory requirements. Nepal’s economy is projected to grow by 5.5 percent in the next fiscal year, 2025-26.However, the World Bank’s report identifies multiple risks to the outlook, including heightened vulnerabilities in the financial system such as a rise in non-performing loans that may limit private sector credit growth, potential policy discontinuity that could deter investment, delays in the execution of the capital spending budget affecting infrastructure development, and regional instability and trade disruptions that could reduce tourism and domestic demand.\"Nepal's economy is on a gradual recovery path,\" said Shiva Raj Adhikari, vice chairman of the National Planning Commission. \"Our focus on enhancing capital expenditure, particularly by completing nearly finished projects, along with reforms in the budgetary process, will strengthen macroeconomic stability, boost domestic productivity, and create more jobs.\"Shocks in migrant-receiving countries such as the Gulf Cooperation Council countries and Malaysia, could also slow growth, impacting international remittances that are crucial for raising household consumption, reducing poverty, and developing human capital. However, migration from Nepal is costly, opportunities are unequal, and the process remains challenging for many. The report presents the latest evidence on the benefits and costs of Nepal’s emigration trend. It highlights key policy interventions needed to build an inclusive migration management system that ensures sustainability and maximises rewards.“Maintaining growth momentum is key to Nepal’s development. This requires continued reform in critical areas such as infrastructure, governance human capital development, and developing an environment which encourages and supports the private sector,” said David Sislen, World Bank Country Director for Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka.“Nepal has greatly benefited from remittances from overseas workers and improving the management of these inflows, better supporting Nepalis who choose to seek work abroad, and also building a vibrant domestic economy which allows for skilled Nepalis to be productive in Nepal is critical to the future of the country.”The World Bank said that an inclusive migration management system would establish a transparent recruitment process, better prepare migrants to go abroad, ensure their safety and mobility in those labor markets, plan for long-term skills and destination diversification, and create an economic environment conducive to harnessing the capital and skills of returnees. \n\nHeavy to very heavy rainfall that continued for 48 hours last week triggered floods and landslides, causing an estimated Rs17 billion in losses to Nepal’s economy, according to the government’s preliminary report unveiled on Tuesday. Economists, however, say the actual losses could be more than three times the preliminary estimate. The agriculture sector took the hardest hit, suffering significant damages.The late-monsoon rainfall flooded and inundated large acreage of crops, with the government projecting an initial loss of Rs6 billion. “This is a preliminary estimate. Losses in the agriculture sector could be staggering,” said an agro-economist at the Department of Agriculture.“The crop losses will have a significant impact on the economy. It will reduce the economic growth rate, increase food prices, reduce farmers’ income, and the food imports will balloon,” he said. “Higher food prices are especially heavy on low-income households, who already spend much of their income on food.”Over the past decades, natural disasters have become increasingly frequent and intense, posing significant risks to economic activities. Nepal’s rain-fed economy has borne the brunt of the monsoon rainfall, which was earlier projected to benefit the country’s ailing agriculture sector. It, however, turned nasty.Chief Secretary Eknarayan Aryal told a press conference in Singha Durbar on Tuesday that the agriculture sector, the lifeline of Nepal’s economy, suffered the biggest losses, amounting to Rs6 billion. This was followed by the energy sector, which suffered a loss of Rs4 billion, water supply Rs3.55 billion, road Rs2.52 billion, and irrigation Rs1 billion.Aryal said that 21 districts were affected, with Sindhuli, Kavrepalanchok, Sindhupalchok, Dhading and the Kathmandu Valley the hardest hit. He said the floods and landslides damaged 37 highways, 312 telecom sites, five major transmission lines, and 16 hydropower projects with a combined capacity of 664 MW.“The destruction was huge. But it’s too early to quantify the exact losses,” said Keshav Acharya, an economist. “Our rough estimate shows that the September disaster may shave off 1 percent from the national GDP,” he said. This translates to Rs57 billion in losses.“Key sectors like service and agriculture, drivers of Nepal’s economic growth, have been hit hard,” said Acharya. “The disaster affected Nepal’s economic hub—the Kathmandu Valley, which accounts for one-fourth of the GDP.”The government may take months to develop the final loss estimates, but experts say before making tall promises to immediately begin the reconstruction drive, it must first assess the health of its treasury. “The government is bankrupt,” said Nara Bahadur Thapa, former executive director of the research department of Nepal Rastra Bank. The government, already in a budget deficit, still owes around Rs40 billion to contractors, Rs13 billion to state-owned commercial banks in interest subsidies, and nearly Rs13 billion to the insurance and health sectors. According to Thapa, the disaster may cause an economic upheaval if not prudently addressed.Agriculture and energy output may drop sharply. Now, instead of exporting electricity to India, Nepal has to buy it. The disaster will also affect tourism. People will not travel, and the transport sector will be hit. And when people don’t travel in the festive season, consumption will be hit. Before the September 28-29 rainfall, the Asian Development Bank projected Nepal’s growth to be 4.9 percent due to a good harvest caused by the regular and strong monsoon, the prospect of energy trade, and improved tourist arrivals.“The disaster has become a headache for the government. It is facing a budget deficit, and funding reconstruction and providing relief would require a huge sum of money, which the government does not have,” said Thapa.Aryal, the chief secretary, told the press meeting that the government’s priority would be relief and reconstruction. However, he did not explain how to fund them.The government said 30,731 security personnel were mobilised for search and rescue.According to the Armed Police Force, the death toll from the disaster has risen to 238, with 29 people still missing. The report said that the disaster destroyed 1,769 houses and 55 bridges.Nepal is bearing the brunt of climate change.According to a recent survey report, climate change has profound impacts on Nepal’s economy, particularly on agriculture, water resources, and biodiversity.The National Climate Change Survey 2022, released by the National Statistics Office (formerly the Central Bureau of Statistics) paints a stark picture of Nepal's climate change situation and urges urgent intervention for the resource-starved Himalayan nation.According to the survey, the economic losses in farm and off-farm in the last five years, as reported by households, excluding significant infrastructure damage, amounted to Rs415.44 billion.At the UN General Assembly in New York, just a few days before the disaster in Nepal unfolded, Nepal’s Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli urged global leaders to take action, including by adequately financing climate adaptation and establishment of a loss and damage fund for vulnerable nations like Nepal.“None of the global challenges we face today has been imposed by aliens. These are of our own making,” he said. “Through understanding, trust, and cooperation, we can overcome them.”On Tuesday, back home in Nepal, Oli told the press meeting that the government would compensate farmers for their losses. “We will send teams to different disaster-hit areas to assess losses. We will also provide relief for the people whose houses have been damaged and who are not insured.”“The government will take short, medium and long-term measures to tackle the problems. Yes, we showed some shortcomings in rescue operations, which will be corrected.”The government plans to complete the search and rescue work within a few days and distribute the relief through a unified system. Chief Secretary Aryal informed that the homeless will be allowed to build temporary housing in a place designated by the government.This year, at the start of the monsoon season, South Asian meteorologists had said that most of the region, including Nepal, would get above-normal monsoon rainfall, which is good for Nepal’s rain-fed agriculture system.However, experts have said it was also a warning sign. Excess rain can result in disasters and may offset economic gains. “We were not prepared for this kind of situation… for a disaster of this scale,” the prime minister said.  \nUS President Joe Biden will announce on Tuesday the donation of 1 million mpox vaccine doses and at least $500 million to African countries to support their response to the outbreak, according to a senior administration official.Biden will make the announcement in New York, where he is attending the United Nations General Assembly, and call on other countries to follow suit, the person told Reuters.In August, the World Health Organization declared mpox a global public health emergency for the second time in two years, following an outbreak of the viral infection in the Democratic Republic of Congo that has spread to neighbouring countries and beyond, including India, raising alarm.“It wouldn’t be a huge surprise if there were a case in the United States, either,” the official said, noting that recent cuts in pandemic support by Congress may hamper a domestic response.“We’re really squeezing right now to be able to respond effectively in this moment. And I think anticipating potentially additional cuts in the future will make it more and more difficult for us to have a robust response to these types of outbreaks.”Mpox can spread through close contact. Usually mild, it is fatal in rare cases. It causes flu-like symptoms and pus-filled lesions on the body.The outbreak in Congo began with the spread of an endemic strain, known as clade I. But a new variant, clade Ib, appears to spread more easily through routine close contact, including sexual contact.The expectation is that the US donated doses will be of the Bavarian Nordic vaccine known as Jynneos in the United States, and many will come from a stockpile in the United States. The 1 million doses is in addition to the 60,000 previously donated shots.The US official said the administration expects Gavi, a public-private alliance which co-funds vaccine purchases for low-income countries, to distribute the donated vaccines.“We feel really strongly that Gavi is the multilateral institution that is best positioned to procure and equitably distribute vaccines,” the official said.Last week, Gavi said it will buy 500,000 doses of Bavarian Nordic's vaccine, its first purchase to help battle the outbreak.The Biden administration is also pushing for more vaccines to be manufactured in low and middle-income countries, and is working with Brazil to identify how the Group of 20 club of nations can support the mpox response.There is not currently a manufacturer in Africa that is able to make the complex drug substance needed to make the vaccine, the US official said. \nAt least 190 women from 51 districts died of complications during childbirth in the fiscal year 2023-024, data provided by the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services show. The actual number of maternal deaths due to birth-related complications could be much higher, as maternal and perinatal death surveillance is being carried out in 51 districts only, officials say.“Maternal deaths from childbirth-related complications could be significantly underreported, as we are only tracking cases in 51 districts,” said Nisha Joshi, a public health official at the division. “We have no data on maternal and perinatal deaths in the rest of the districts.”In the fiscal year 2022-023, 191 maternal deaths were recorded across 49 districts. Nepal reduced the maternal mortality rate from 239 per 100,000 births in 2016 to 151 per 100,000 in 2021, according to the national census carried out by the National Statistics Office. Earlier, the country had reduced the maternal mortality rate from 539 per 100,000 births in 1996 to 239 per 100,000 births in 2016—for which the country even received a Millennium Development Goals award. The health target under the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals is to reduce the maternal mortality rate to 75 per 100,000 births by 2030.The latest census report has shown that 622 maternal deaths were recorded in a year. Officials at the Health Ministry concede that the number of deaths reported from 51 districts is only around 30 percent of the total maternal deaths occurring across the country.They complained that the lack of maternal and perinatal death surveillance programmes in all districts is the main reason for the underreporting of maternal deaths. “Due to budget constraints, we could not expand the maternal and perinatal death surveillance to other districts this year,” said Joshi. “We also have problems in the reporting system, and deaths that occur in villages of the districts without surveillance programmes go unreported.”Maternal health experts say that concerned authorities are keeping themselves in the dark by not conducting studies in all districts. “Without knowing the actual situation, effective planning is not possible, which means efforts to reduce ongoing deaths may not succeed,” said Dr Ganesh Dangal, a maternal health expert. A huge budget is not necessary to carry out death surveillance. So this programme should be enforced mandatorily in all districts immediately.”Maternal and perinatal death surveillance is a key intervention for improving maternal, perinatal, and neonatal survival rates. Experts say such surveillance provides an understanding of the number and causes of deaths, enabling more targeted and effective interventions.Nepal strives to reduce the deaths of mothers and babies. However, it lacks maternal and perinatal death surveillance in all districts.Perinatal death is the death of a baby between 22 weeks of gestation (or weighing 500g) and seven days after birth.The World Health Organisation said that maternal and perinatal death surveillance and response (MPDSR) is an essential quality improvement intervention, which permits the identification, notification, quantification and determination of causes and avoidability of maternal and neonatal deaths and stillbirth to orient the measures necessary for their prevention.According to the UN health body, systematic analyses of overall mortality trends and events and contributing factors leading to individual deaths can identify barriers in health systems and inspire local solutions to prevent such deaths in the future.Studies carried out in the past show that excessive bleeding after childbirth, pre-eclampsia and eclampsia (pregnancy-related high blood pressure disorders) are some of the reasons for maternal deaths.The World Health Organisation said postpartum haemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal mortality in low-income countries and the primary cause of nearly a quarter of all maternal deaths globally. Most deaths resulting from the said complication occur during the first 24 hours after birth.Gynaecologists say tears in the cervix or tissues of the vagina, tear in a blood vessel in the uterus, bleeding in hidden tissue area or space in the pelvis, blood clotting disorders, and placenta problems are among the causes of postpartum haemorrhage.Every year, over 600,000 women deliver babies in Nepal. \nAs many as 17 people, including children, have died, and 63 others have been infected with the Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus since the start of the monsoon in June this year.Twenty-nine districts, including those in the Kathmandu Valley, have reported infection from the deadly virus, while 12 districts—Kailali, Kapilvastu, Palpa, Chitwan, Parsa, Rautahat, Sarlahi, Siraha, Dhanusha, Sindhuli, Jhapa and Sunsari—have reported deaths from the infection.“We have alerted agencies concerned to conduct awareness drives and implement other prevention measures in the districts where Japanese encephalitis infections or deaths have been reported,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division. “We have also requested various aid agencies, including the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation, to supply JE vaccine.”Japanese encephalitis is a viral brain infection caused by the JE virus, which is endemic in Asia and parts of the Western Pacific. According to the World Health Organization, it is a mosquito-borne flavivirus, belonging to the same family as dengue, Zika, yellow fever, and West Nile viruses. The virus kills a third of those who fall ill and leaves up to half of those who survive with severe life-long disabilities, according to the UN health body.Officials say that September and October are the peak months for JE outbreaks.Health officials say this year’s death rate from the JE virus has exceeded 27 percent, and among the deceased, the number of children under 15 years of age is very high. Nepal has included the vaccine in its routine immunisation list, which the government provides free of cost to all children.The country started administering the vaccine doses in 2006, eight years before the World Health Organization officially issued prequalification certification, due to the high infection and deaths from the virus at the time. In 2005, JE killed nearly 2,000 people in Nepal—mostly children from the districts of Tarai region. In the first phase, all populations of the highly-affected four districts, Banke, Bardia, Dang, and Kailali, were inoculated with the JE vaccine. Later, the vaccination programme was expanded to 19 other affected districts, and children under 15 were inoculated.The government integrated the JE vaccine into the routine immunisation list in 2015. Even though the vaccine is included in the regular immunisation list, several people still die, and dozens get infected by the deadly virus every year.Data from the Health Ministry show that less than 50 percent of the infected patients were found inoculated with the vaccine.Doctors say the disease has no cure, so treatment focuses on managing symptoms. However, safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent infection. Health officials said they are aware of the deadly disease outbreak and have already started consulting aid agencies for help to finance the JE vaccination programme.However, officials at the Department of Health Services said that none of the donors have taken health officials' requests seriously or shown interest in supporting the immunisation drive.Public health experts say that this is the right time to vaccinate all those at risk. Even if the vaccine does not help in outbreak management, it provides immunity from future infections. The JE virus is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected Culex mosquitoes. Pigs and ducks are considered natural reservoirs of the virus.Doctors advise taking precautions to avoid mosquito bites, such as using mosquito repellents, wearing long-sleeved clothes, and getting vaccinated if one lives in or is travelling to disease-endemic areas. They also stress the importance of awareness and timely treatment to prevent infections and deaths.An estimated 12.5 million people are thought to be at high risk of JE infection in Nepal. \nDusit Princess Kathmandu is organising a five-day trout festival at its SOI restaurant. The dishes will be available for order from 12:30 pm to 10:00 pm every day till August 30. In celebration of Nepal’s rivers and lakes, which provide an ideal environment for high-quality trout, the Director of Culinary Food and Beverage Service, Chef Utpal Mondal, and his team at Dusit Princess Kathmandu have crafted a menu showcasing the flavours and versatility of locally sourced trout. “As the festive month of Shrawan ends, people focus on healthy and nutritious food. Trout, rich in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and essential minerals, offers a heart-friendly option that checks all the boxes from a nutritional and culinary standpoint,” says Mondal.He adds that the goal of the culinary event is to offer their guests a rare opportunity to experience a wide variety of trout dishes they wouldn’t typically find at home.The event menu features twelve unique dishes, six of which are drawn from diverse culinary traditions across continents. Three dishes are inspired by oriental cuisine, while the remaining three highlight flavours from Nepal and India. The menu has been designed to include various dishes, from soups and starters to main courses, including Mexican, Italian, Continental, and Thai flavours.While discussing the event’s highlights, Mondal said, “The celebration presents a unique opportunity for guests to indulge in a diverse range of trout-based dishes, something they wouldn’t typically have the chance to experience elsewhere.” \nA novice baker embarks on a culinary journey, learning through trial and error the importance of precise measurements, ingredients, and techniques in achieving successful baked creations.\nThe Stonewall Riots catalyzed the LGBTQIA+ rights movement, leading to the creation of safe spaces like Inclusive Galaxy, a haven for the queer community that promotes financial independence and fosters societal acceptance.\nNepali chef Aditya Mishra, recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship, promotes Nepali cuisine in New York through his restaurant 'The Sewing Tin', showcasing traditional dishes with modern influences like Confit Duck Chatamari, and highlighting the immigrant experience in the city.\nCeleus Baral, a 21-year-old environmental science student, launched Bakeleus, an online baking shop, in 2021, using her knowledge of baking science and passion for nature to create unique sweet treats from scratch.\nThe noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built. Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \nFrom producing films to trekking Everest, the author's journey has been marked by nature's lessons, personal resilience, and the pursuit of life's meaning through art and adventure.\nA 5-day whirlwind tour of Sri Lanka covered 1,000 kilometers, showcasing religious sites, heritage landmarks, cultural attractions, and the nation's resurgent tourism industry despite economic challenges, with direct flights connecting Nepal and Sri Lanka.\nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nKarnali Yashvis continued their winning start in the Everest Women’s Volleyball League as they defeated Lalitpur Queens in straight sets of 3-0 at the National Sports Council’s covered hall in Kathmandu on Wednesday.Lalitpur, who ended Tuesday on the top of table with a 25-15, 26-24, 24-26, 25-23 victory over Madhesh United in the evening late fixture, started the day’s event on Wednesday and battled till the end but lost each set by a thin margin.Karnali won the first and the second sets 25-22, 25-22 and were 9-1 behind at one point in the third set. But they fought back to rally to a 29-27 victory.It was their third victory in as many matches as they now remain the only team to keep an unbeaten streak in the league.Karnali had defeated Madhesh United and Gandaki Thunders in their previous clashes.The victory also fired Karnali to the summit of the standings with eight points. Lalitpur, who have two victories, are on six points.The top two teams at the end of the single round robin league will progress into the final, which is taking place on October 5. \nNepal all-rounder Dipendra Singh Airee climbed up four spots to reach the second position in the International Cricket Council’s Men’s T20I all-rounder rankings on Wednesday.Airee received a career-best rating of 230 to leave behind Australia’s Marcus Stoinis (211), Zimbabwe’s Sikandar Raza (208), Sri Lanka’s Wanindu Hasaranga (206), Afghanistan’s Mohammad Nabi (205) and India’s Hardik Pandya (199).This is the highest position a Nepali cricketer has achieved in ICC rankings.England’s Liam Livingstone is ranked number one in the all-rounder rankings with a rating of 253.Gulsan Jha improved 11 positions to climb up to 53rd position, while Kushal Bhurtel also moved six positions up to 60 in the rankings.Rohit Paudel is also ranked 53rd, while Karan KC is in the 71st position. \nBabar Azam has resigned as Pakistan’s white-ball cricket captain for a second time in 11 months, citing a need to lessen his workload and focus on improving his game.Babar stepped down as captain of all three formats last year after Pakistan failed to make the knockout stage of the 50-overs World Cup, before returning as white-ball skipper in March ahead of the Twenty20 World Cup, where Pakistan did not make it to the Super Eight stage.“It’s been an honour to lead this team, but it’s time for me to step down and focus on my playing role,” Babar wrote in a post on X on Tuesday.“Captaincy has been a rewarding experience, but it’s added a significant workload. I want to prioritise my performance, enjoy my batting, and spend quality time with my family, which brings me joy.“By stepping down, I will gain clarity moving forward and focus more energy on my game and personal growth.”Pakistan won just six of the 13 T20 matches they played under Babar in his second stint, and the 2009 champions were involved in the T20 World Cup’s biggest upset when they were beaten by hosts the United States.He did not take charge of any one-day international matches.Pakistan will host England in three tests starting in Multan on Monday, before travelling to Australia for ODI and T20 matches in November. \nCanada secured a four-wicket victory over Nepal in the fourth match of the Canada T20 Tri-Series, held at the Maple Leaf North-West Ground, King City, Canada.The hosts chased the 140-run target set by the Rhinos with three balls to spare.Canada faced an early setback when Navneet Dhaliwal was bowled by Lalit Rajbanshi for 12 off 16 balls in the fifth over.Harsh Thaker, who followed, scored 11 off 9 deliveries before falling to Rajbanshi, leaving Canada at 45-2 in the eighth over. Captain Nicholas Kirton provided some stability, blasting 26 from just 14 balls, including two sixes, before being dismissed by Sompal Kami.Canada’s innings faltered again when Dilpreet Bajwa, who had anchored the innings with 25 off 29 balls, was run out in the 12th over.When Shreyas Movva was stumped by Aasif Sheikh off Sandeep Lamichhane shortly after, and Dilon Heyliger fell for a duck two balls later, Canada were in trouble at 90-6 in the 15th over.However, the lower order provided the rescue. Ravinderpal Singh and Saad Bin Zafar forged a crucial unbeaten partnership to guide Canada to victory. Zafar was instrumental, scoring a quickfire 33 not out off 18 balls, with four boundaries and a six, while Ravinderpal contributed an unbeaten 20 runs from 21 balls.Nepal’s bowling attack was led by Sandeep Lamichhane and Lalit Rajbanshi, who took two wickets each, with Rajbanshi delivering a particularly economical spell of 4-0-20-2.Earlier, Nepal, having been put into bat, posted a total of 139-6 in their 20 overs. Opener Anil Sah was the standout performer for Nepal, scoring 41 off 30 balls with four boundaries and three sixes. He provided a solid start alongside Aasif Sheikh, who made 30 from 30 deliveries. The pair shared a 70-run opening partnership before Sah was dismissed by Harsh Thaker in the 10th over.Nepal’s middle order struggled to capitalise on the strong start. Captain Rohit Paudel was dismissed cheaply for 4, caught by Ravinderpal Singh off Thaker. Kushal Malla and Kushal Bhurtel also failed to make an impact, with Malla scoring 4 off 12 balls and Bhurtel managing 13 off 15 before losing their wickets.However, Gulsan Jha provided a late surge, remaining unbeaten on 23 off 16 balls, including two sixes. He was supported by Dipendra Singh Airee, who chipped in with 12 off 9 deliveries, and Karan KC, who blasted 8 off just 2 balls in the final over.Canada’s bowlers delivered an impressive performance that restricted Nepal’s scoring. Saad Bin Zafar was particularly effective, conceding just 13 runs from his four overs while picking up the wicket of Aasif Sheikh. Harsh Thaker was the leading wicket-taker with 2-17 from his four overs, while Parveen Kumar and Akhil Kumar claimed a wicket each. \nIsrael bombed central Beirut in the early hours of Thursday, killing at least six people, after its forces suffered their deadliest day on the Lebanese front in a year of clashes against Iran-backed armed group Hezbollah.Israel said it conducted a precise air strike on Beirut. Reuters witnesses reported hearing a massive blast, and a security source said it targeted a building in central Beirut’s Bachoura neighbourhood close to parliament, the nearest Israeli strikes have come to Lebanon’s seat of government.At least six people were killed and seven wounded, Lebanese health officials said. A photo being circulated on Lebanese WhatsApp groups, which Reuters could not immediately verify, showed a heavily damaged building with its first floor on fire.Three missiles also hit the southern suburb of Dahiyeh, where Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed last week, and loud explosions were heard, Lebanese security officials said. The southern suburbs came under more than a dozen Israeli strikes on Wednesday.A day after Iran fired more than 180 missiles into Israel, Israel said on Wednesday eight soldiers were killed in ground combat in south Lebanon as its forces thrust into its northern neighbour.The Israeli military said regular infantry and armoured units joined its ground operations in Lebanon on Wednesday as Iran’s missile attack and Israel’s promise of retaliation raised concerns that the oil-producing Middle East could be caught up in a wider conflict.Hezbollah said its fighters engaged Israeli forces inside Lebanon. The movement reported ground clashes for the first time since Israeli forces pushed over the border on Monday. Hezbollah said it had destroyed three Israeli Merkava tanks with rockets near the border town of Maroun El Ras.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in a condolence video, said: “We are at the height of a difficult war against Iran’s Axis of Evil, which wants to destroy us.“This will not happen because we will stand together and with God’s help, we will win together,” he said.Lebanon’s health ministry said Israeli air raids killed at least 46 people in the south and centre of the country over the past 24 hours.Iran said on Wednesday its missile volley - its biggest ever assault on Israel - was over barring further provocation, but Israel and the United States promised to hit back hard.U.S. President Joe Biden said he would not support any Israeli strike on Iran’s nuclear sites in response to its ballistic missile attack and urged Israel to act “proportionally” against its regional arch-foe.Biden joined a call with Group of Seven major power leaders on Wednesday to coordinate a response, including new sanctions against Tehran, the White House said.G7 leaders voiced “strong concern” over the Middle East crisis but said a diplomatic solution was still viable and a region-wide conflict was in no one’s interest, a statement said.Hezbollah said it repelled Israeli forces near several border towns and also fired rockets at military posts inside Israel.The paramilitary group’s media chief Mohammad Afif said those battles were only “the first round” and that Hezbollah had enough fighters, weapons and ammunition to push back Israel.Israel’s addition of infantry and armoured troops from the 36th Division, including the Golani Brigade, the 188th Armoured Brigade and 6th Infantry Brigade, suggested that the operation might expand beyond limited commando raids.The military has said its incursion is largely aimed at destroying tunnels and other infrastructure on the border and there were no plans for a wider operation targeting the Lebanese capital Beirut to the north or major cities in the south.1.2 MILLION LEBANESE DISPLACEDNevertheless, it issued new evacuation orders for around two dozen towns along the southern border, instructing inhabitants to head north of the Awali River, which flows east to west some 60 km (37 miles) north of the Israeli frontier.More than 1,900 people have been killed and over 9,000 wounded in Lebanon in almost a year of cross-border fighting, with most of the deaths occurring in the past two weeks, according to Lebanese government statistics.Caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati said that about 1.2 million Lebanese had been displaced by Israeli attacks.Malika Joumaa, from Sudan, was forced to take shelter in Saint Joseph’s church in Beirut after being forced from her house near Sidon in coastal south Lebanon with her husband and two children.“It’s good that the church offered its help. We were going to stay in the streets; where would we have gone?”Iran described Tuesday’s missile assault as a response to Israeli killings of militant leaders, including Nasrallah, attacks in Lebanon against the group and Israel’s war against Palestinian Hamas militants in Gaza.There were no casualties from the missile onslaught in Israel, but one person was killed in the occupied West Bank. \nLiberal Democratic Party President Shigeru Ishiba was designated the new prime minister Tuesday afternoon at plenary sessions of both houses in an extraordinary Diet session that was convened on the day.The new Cabinet was launched on Tuesday night after the investiture ceremony for Ishiba and the attestation ceremony for newly appointed ministers at the Imperial Palace.Ishiba held a press conference that night to explain his administration’s basic policies and major policy agendas. The new Cabinet will focus its efforts on restoration and reconstruction in the areas affected by the Noto Peninsula Earthquake and the vitalization of local economies, among other issues.At the press conference, Ishiba announced to dissolve the House of Representatives on Oct. 9 and hold a lower house election with the official start of the campaign on Oct. 15 and the voting and ballot counting on Oct. 27.“I will speak the truth to the people with courage and sincerity. I will conduct my politics with humility, sincerity and warmth,” he said.- In association with Asia News Network \nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nWhat animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. \nNepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) \nFollowing up on my previous piece on \"Chief ministers' insights on federalism\", this article explores the views of Lumbini, Karnali, and Sudurpashchim provinces.At a programme in Lumbini, Chief Minister Chet Narayan Acharya highlighted a major concern: The 26 percent reduction in the fiscal equalisation grant. Despite repeated requests, the federal government has not adequately addressed this issue, causing significant financial strain on the province. The constitutional right of provinces to fiscal transfers has been compromised, particularly due to delays and reductions in equalisation grants and the haphazard allocation of conditional grants.Since the implementation of federalism, Lumbini has seen considerable development. Acharya emphasised that while the federal government should devolve constitutional powers to the provinces, the provinces must also allow local governments to independently carry out their functions.However, despite these constitutional rights, some problems persist. For instance, the federal government retains the authority to initiate legal actions against civil servants, even though these officials are expected to serve under provincial and local jurisdictions. This creates friction between different levels of government. Additionally, the federal government has not allowed the provinces to manage the police security force.The chief minister highlighted Lumbini's development achievements, noting that the province has nearly doubled its road network from 11,000 to 22,000 kilometres, proving it a key contributor to national progress. Lumbini's focus on capital expenditure contrasts with the increasing current expenditures at the federal and local levels.In Karnali, Chief Minister Yam Lal Kandel acknowledged the difficulties of federal governance but pointed to the significant progress made over the past seven years. He emphasised that party-based politics heavily influences institutional actions, yet Karnali has shown tangible advancements. Kandel stressed that the time has come to focus on policy implementation rather than public opinion. Learning from past experiences and addressing problems head-on should be the priority.Kandel voiced concerns about centralised thinking persisting even within a federal system. He urged caution in rushing constitutional amendments that might create chaos. Fiscal distribution to the provincial government remains imbalanced, requiring adjustments to ensure fairness and equity.Governance problems, including officials' reluctance to serve in remote areas and political interference in administrative matters, further complicate the implementation of federalism. Despite these challenges, Kandel firmly believes that strengthening the federal governance system through meaningful reforms and transparent governance is essential.Sudurpashchim’s Chief Minister, Kamal Bahadur Shah, reflected on both his province's progress and challenges. He mentioned a 17-point proposal the province submitted last year to the National Coordination Council meeting, outlining key issues, such as fiscal distribution and project selection imbalances, requiring federal leadership’s attention.A notable achievement for Sudurpashchim has been the passage of the Civil Service Law, though inconsistencies between federal and provincial interpretations remain. For example, the federal government insists on appointing 12th-grade level officials as provincial secretaries, while the province prefers 11th-level officials. These discrepancies hinder the smooth implementation of federalism. Chief Minister Shah emphasised the need to address core issues like fiscal distribution and project selection, which are crucial for making federalism work for people. While Sudurpashchim has made significant strides, Shah remains optimistic. He believes that with continued dialogue and collaboration, the province can overcome remaining challenges and ensure that federalism not only survives but thrives in Nepal.The interaction programmes conducted by the Federalism & Localisation Centre also included other vital participants such as ministers, speakers, deputy speakers, provincial assembly members, local government chiefs and deputy chiefs, political party leaders, civil servants and civil society members. They reviewed the successes and challenges of the federal governance system, including provincial governments. They emphasised that while preserving the achievements gained through long struggles and sacrifices, the government must build trust in the federal system. This should be accompanied by reforms that ensure justice, equality, good governance and sustainable development. Although there are many questions about the federal government system, stakeholders from all seven provinces have stressed the need to strengthen the system through necessary improvements.There are growing concerns among citizens regarding the federal governance system, particularly the provinces. Political parties do not seem serious about the implementation of federalism. Provinces have been deprived of the constitutional rights granted to them. They lack the authority to exercise control over the police and do not have administrative control over their own staff. Chief ministers are unable to fully exercise their power and must seek approval from central leaders even for small decisions. The provincial structures of political parties are also not aligned with the federal system, as central leaders do not allow provincial party committees to exercise their authority.Local governments in Nepal have been well-organised and effective in exerting pressure on the federal and provincial governments. A notable example occurred when the federal government reduced the fiscal equalisation grant by 26 percent for both provinces and local levels. Local government associations strongly opposed this decision and applied significant pressure, which led to the reinstatement of the grant at the local level. However, the federal government did not release the funds to the provinces, and the provincial grant for FY 2024-25 has decreased compared to FY 2018-19 despite a 550 billion rupee increase in the federal budget. Additionally, several bills infringing on provincial and local governments’ rights have been introduced in the federal parliament. During my tenure as a Member of Parliament, I opposed many of these bills, which aimed to infringe on the rights of the provinces and local levels through legislation. This ongoing centralisation threatens the federal system and undermines the authority of subnational governments.Lobbying within the federal parliament and among political parties is essential to protecting provincial and local rights and promoting the successful practices of subnational governments. However, provincial leaders have struggled to effectively organise themselves against federal overreach because they fear antagonising central leadership.In response to these challenges, I coordinated the establishment of the Federalism & Localisation Centre, a think tank created just over a month ago in consultation with the provinces and political party leaders, particularly those who are sincere and committed to federalism and subnational governments.The think tank conducts research and legislative activities (including post-legislative scrutiny) and fosters intergovernmental relations by coordinating efforts with federal units. The centre brings together representatives from all major political parties in Nepal and experts from various disciplines, aiming to strengthen federalism, democracy and inclusion in the country. Again, reflecting on the interaction programmes: From Koshi's advocacy for equitable resource sharing to Madhesh's call for stronger political commitment to federalism, Bagmati's concerns over police integration, Gandaki’s push for land acquisition, Lumbini’s focus on infrastructure growth, Karnali’s commitment to transparent governance and Sudurpashchim’s emphasis on civil service reforms—each province has demonstrated a solid commitment to making federalism work. The provinces stress the need for consistent action from the federal government and leadership from political parties to truly institutionalise the federal system.The path forward lies in meaningful reforms, clearer constitutional guidelines and greater cooperation between all levels of government. By addressing these challenges, empowering provinces and delivering tangible benefits to its citizens, Nepal can strengthen its federal system. Federalism in Nepal is still evolving, but with sustained effort, it has the potential to transform governance and development across the country. \nThe history of Nepalis serving in foreign armies dates back more than 200 years, primarily focused on recruitment into the British and Indian militaries. However, the participation of Nepalis in the Russian army is a recent phenomenon. It emerged in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine war that began in February 2022. By May 2023, reports surfaced that Nepalis were being recruited to fight for Russia despite the absence of any formal agreements between the two countries. This recruitment has exposed several Nepalis to grave risks and resulted in tragic loss of lives.Unconfirmed reports suggest that 600 to 1,000 Nepalis have joined the Russian military. Many of these individuals arrived in Russia on student or tourist visas, facilitated by human traffickers who promised lucrative jobs in the Russian armed forces. These traffickers reportedly charge between $1,500 to $2,500 per person in the name of providing such opportunities.Nepal’s law prohibits its citizens from joining foreign militaries, except in cases involving long-standing treaties with India and the United Kingdom. Nevertheless, the allure of a stable income in a foreign land has driven many in Nepal, often from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, to walk on this dangerous path. While the Government of Nepal has arrested some of those involved in trafficking, the efforts to control this illicit activity remain inadequate.The plight of Nepali soldiers in the Russian army is a stark reminder of the dangers of being drawn into a foreign conflict. Media reports indicate that around 40 Nepalis have died in the conflict with Ukraine, with many others missing or captured as prisoners of war. A significant factor contributing to these casualties is the inadequate training these individuals received before being deployed to the front lines. Their lack of combat experience, coupled with minimal proficiency in the Russian language, put them at extreme risk. This loss has caused outrage in Nepal, with growing calls for the Russian government to halt its recruitment efforts and repatriate the bodies of those killed. In response to the outcry from Nepal, diplomatic efforts were initiated to address the recruitment issue. The government of Nepal has been in regular communication with Russian authorities to facilitate the safe return of its citizens. Diplomatic channels have been used to negotiate compensation for the families of the deceased or those who were injured in the war. However, there remains limited information on the compensation these families might receive. They are anticipated to receive approximately $150,000, while those injured may receive about $33,000. Nonetheless, these compensations cannot truly alleviate the families’ pain and suffering if they materialise.The underlying cause driving Nepalis to risk their lives in foreign armies is ingrained in Nepal's economic struggles. The country's persistent unemployment problem, exacerbated by ineffective government policies, has left its youth with few opportunities for gainful employment. Agriculture has become unattractive for many due to rising production costs and stagnant market prices. Consequently, a significant portion of Nepal's youth has turned away from farming and is opting for foreign employment.In 2023, over 741,000 Nepalese citizens, including 661,000 men and 80,000 women, left the country searching for work. The Terai region, in particular, has seen a mass exodus, with the Dhanusha district sending the largest number of workers abroad, followed by Jhapa, Morang, Siraha and Mahottari. Traditionally reliant on agricultural employment, these districts have been unable to offer viable livelihoods to their residents, forcing many to seek jobs in countries like Malaysia, the Gulf States, and others.A few decades ago, the primary destination for Nepali migrant workers was India, particularly the states of Haryana, Punjab and Delhi. However, labour migration has shifted towards other global markets in recent years as Nepalis seek better wages and working conditions in more distant lands.Nepal is not alone paying the price in the Russian-Ukraine war. Reports indicate that Indian citizens have also been recruited into the Russian military, facing similar hardships and casualties. The Indian government, like Nepal, has been in talks with Russian officials to secure the release and safe return of its citizens. The plight of these soldiers has drawn attention to the broader issue of economic migration in South Asia, where large populations are forced to leave their home countries due to a lack of opportunities.In Nepal, family members of those recruited into the Russian army have staged hunger strikes, frustrated by what they perceive as insufficient government action to stop the recruitment. They also submitted an 11-point memorandum to former Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane, demanding the safe rescue of their loved ones serving in the Russian army, as well as financial relief for the families of those killed in the war. These protests highlight the desperate situation faced by both the soldiers and their families, who feel abandoned by the state.The case of Nepali citizens joining the Russian army is a tragic consequence of a much larger problem: The government's failure to provide adequate employment opportunities at home. Driven by poverty and desperation, young Nepali men and women are forced to take extreme measures, including risking their lives in foreign conflicts. The situation exposes the inadequacies of Nepal's planning and policies, which have been unable to address the root causes of migration or create sustainable livelihoods for its citizens.The government's response, though belated, has included diplomatic engagement and promises of compensation. However, this is not enough to reverse the tide of migration or to prevent future tragedies. Nepal must urgently address its unemployment crisis, particularly in the agricultural sector, which has historically been a source of employment for the majority of its population. If the youth continue to abandon their homeland in search of work, the future of Nepal's economy, and its social fabric, appears bleak. \nAccording to police reports, by Monday evening, the freak monsoon downpour and the resultant flooding and mudslides over the weekend have claimed over 200 lives. About 127 people have been injured, and 56 are still missing. The government claims that some 4,022 stranded people on the damaged highways and flooded zones across Nepal have been successfully rescued. There are no official figures on the loss of lives and properties in the Kathmandu Valley and beyond.Yet, every patch of dark cloud in the sky seems ominous. Weather experts have warned of more heavy rains in the coming days. However, what is most worrying is the government's lack of preparedness. Returning from the UN General Assembly Meeting in the United States on Monday, Prime Minister Khadka Prasad Sharma Oli said that he hadn’t even imagined this level of flooding in Kathmandu.A national disaster People call this a natural disaster; I’d rather call it a national disaster of epic proportions. The government, led by a coalition of the two largest parties—the Nepali Congress and the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist Leninist)—miserably failed to not only protect people’s lives but also, according to its admission, to coordinate the resources and manpower to save them. Even Balen Shah, the Mayor of Kathmandu Metropolitan City, who has made quite a name for himself by doing some remarkable works in the capital city, failed to mobilise his offices. He announced the dispatch of 300 city police personnel only after the river systems here had flooded tremendously and claimed some lives. How pathetic!True, he may not be able to do much in such an unplanned and unmanaged capital town. He has done his best to destroy some illegal constructions and somehow restore the old glory. Shah has also displayed his zeal for discovering and reviving, albeit with limited success, some traditional river systems that have been legally or illegally buried under the concrete for centuries. In this effort, the mayor has fought with many parties and the traditional court systems. Yet, this time, the charismatic mayor had no substantial disaster management plans. Some members of the political parties, including those from the opposition, the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre), volunteered to search and rescue people buried alive in the mud. I wish more people were deployed by parties and other organisations to serve the needy in the affected areas. But this is not enough. It’s time all parties, big and small, took the issue of natural disasters more seriously. It’s important to revitalise the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority, appoint exporters and allocate more resources instead of merely using them as a tool to appease party workers. To achieve this and other vital things, there must be a robust debate in the Parliament, including in state legislatures, about how best to tackle the recurring problem of landslides and flooding. They should get the help of experts in the area and international experts to design policies and programmes for preventing and swiftly dealing with natural catastrophes. What we’ve just witnessed has been a national disgrace. Even the vehicles and people buried in Jhyaple Khola—very close to Kathmandu and next to the starting point of the near-complete underground tunnel system built by Japan—were dug out of the mud after many hours. What took so long? Good use of helicopters?We may be too poor to own an airforce; defence-wise, it’s not essential either. However, the least the government could do is engage dedicated army helicopters in disaster management. Importantly, as some retired police officers have publicly stressed, it’s time the Nepal Police had its own helicopters suitable for swift action, at least for the aid of communities nestled in remote hills and mountains. If parties are serious about this problem, they should stop using government helicopters to carry leaders to every nook and corner of the country—especially for partisan events. If they want to use them, they should pay separately. There must be a strict check and balance on this matter. This way, much of the resources wasted in the service of big or influential leaders could be channelled to people badly hit by floods and landslides. The language of disasterOn Monday, in an article in Setopati, veteran journalist and writer Narayan Wagle claimed that we have never tried to understand the “language” of disasters. He says that every natural disaster, including the big 2015 Gorkha Earthquakes, makes a statement, but neither the government nor people understand its meaning. He blamed mainly the journalists for their persistent enthusiasm to report the quantities of deaths and injuries but little interest in debating possible ways to minimise the harm. I agree with Wagle: We all need to do some serious soul-searching about our attitude to natural calamities and their deadly impacts. Only when we, the members of civil society, are sensitive to the issue can we hold the government accountable. Needless to say, much of our civil society is linked to political parties and national and international non-government organisations. The ruling CPN (UML) boasts the largest number of members who either run or work for NGOs and INGOs. These bodies also have more resources and, in some cases, expertise. Working with the government at all levels through party channels, they could and should play a vital role in raising sensitivities towards the problem of disaster management.Disaster prevention and management is one of the few areas which is relatively non-political and uncontroversial. Parties on the left, right or centre wouldn’t object to the policies and programmes for disaster mitigation and management. And, of course, foreign government and non-government agencies would readily offer a hand with financial resources and expertise. I’m pretty certain that all donors would be willing to help the Nepal Police and Nepal Army with a few light helicopters useful for search and rescue after natural calamities.  \nOn April 26, 2024, sidhakura.com, an online portal, disseminated a series of malicious audio-video content involving the chairs of two media houses. The fake content even dragged the Supreme Court, citing that the two chairs had met incumbent and former SC justices and senior advocates to dismiss over 400 corruption court cases. When the misleading content spread, the judicial body immediately responded, launching a suo moto contempt of court case against the portal’s publisher and editor. After months of investigation, the court on Sunday issued a final verdict and showed the prison’s door to the guilty. In addition to the portal’s publisher and editor, who got a prison sentence of three months each, another person, who supposedly conducted the infamous ‘sting operation’ on the portal’s behalf got six months in jail. Such harsh sentencing was due, and it gives a clear message that anyone who peddles false news in the name of journalism will be severely punished. The timely verdict also draws a clear line between free speech and disinformation and misinformation. The online portal’s claims were based on false premises and ambiguities. First, without any regard for media ethics, the editor and the publisher sensationalised the content, relying on an unverified audio clip provided by a third party. Second, when the Supreme Court and Press Council Nepal summoned them to be present at the court with evidence to substantiate their reports, they failed to do so. The sidhakura content unfortunately represents one of many cases of fake news that have surfaced in Nepal with the advent of new forms of technology, which in turn undermines democracy and the rule of law. Whether on social media platforms or traditional media outlets, disinformation intended to mislead people and misinformation with outright lies have become all too common. The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) has escalated the problem with the help of deepfakes—audio recordings, video clips or images replicating someone else’s identity using AI tools to spread false information. Deepfakes have been used not only to damage reputations but also to ‘report’ on events that are impossible in real life. In the recent tragic flooding and other natural disasters, deepfake videos simulating various kinds of calamities have been circulated, either to get views and likes or to spread fear. Fake news and deepfakes have also affected elections in many countries this year.Nepal’s Electronic Transaction Act, the umbrella law covering such cases, is limited in scope, primarily focused on traditional forms of crimes like digital fraud and identity theft. It doesn’t address emerging threats brought about by artificial intelligence. A new law to incorporate these has thus become vital. As important is sensitising people about the consequences of defaming other people through news outlets or social media platforms. The precedent set by Sunday’s ruling will help. While the media must be free to investigate and report on sensitive issues, this freedom cannot be misused to spread baseless rumours. Sunday’s verdict can be a good place to start the much-needed conversation on the regulation of various kinds of media. This debate will have to be extensive and nuanced as it is so easy to err in this case, either on the side of too much caution or too much liberty. \nOn Saturday, massive rains left at least 64 people dead and countless more injured. It uprooted people from their homes and left thousands without phone lines and electricity. Economic damages alone were estimated at between $95 billion and $100 billion. Local disaster responders said that given the scale of the event, some deaths and destruction were inevitable, even with the best of preparations. The trail of devastation that Hurricane Helene has left in its wake in the southeastern United States is the worst in decades. On the same day, halfway across the world in Nepal, incessant rains and floods and landslides killed at least 170, injured another 100, while 68 went missing. In Kathmandu Valley alone, 37 people perished in the heaviest rains the valley has seen in 54 years. Police personnel and rescue workers were digging up debris in multiple locations in the country, in the fear that more people might be buried. Both in the southeastern US seaboard and Nepal, Saturday’s water-induced disasters can be attributed to unpredictable weather. Yet, at least in Nepal’s case, climate change is only a part of a much larger story of neglect.Saturday’s tragedy in Nepal represents an egregious failure of the Nepali state to keep its citizens safe. Days in advance, the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology had been putting out reminders that the country was in for unprecedented rains. The message was endlessly broadcast through media platforms as well as each and every cell phone. Yet, when the tragedy struck, responsible government agencies seemed completely unprepared. Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak made a mockery of himself when he attributed the government’s failure to save four people who were stranded on their roof in Nakhu of Lalitpur to ‘poor visibility’ as a result of which choppers, supposedly, could not reach them. But then a good samaritan, Chaniklal Tamang, managed to rescue two of them by diving into the swollen Nakhu River. There could not be a better sign of the Nepali state’s incompetence. Not just incompetence though. The casual way high-ranking government officials like Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, Deputy Prime Minister Prakash Man Singh and Home Minister Lekhak have responded to queries over the government’s handling of the crisis shows an utter disregard for the lives of common folks. It was also galling that the police and army personnel deployed for rescue efforts, be it in Kathmandu or Dhading, reported having to work without basic equipment like raft jackets and rescue ropes. This suggests that even though water-induced disasters claim thousands of lives every year in Nepal, disaster preparedness and response have never been the state’s priority. It is easy to see why. Those in leadership positions in the government are too busy scheming to prolong their stay in power—when not working for various vested interests. Except during election time, seldom do they spend any time listening to people’s concerns. The country’s prime minister sending back from New York his smiling pictures with VVIPs while his country struggled with a national tragedy was not just a matter of poor optics and iffy judgment. In the eyes of the Nepali people, it was also an indication of his misplaced priorities. \nFrom 1977 to 2007, in the process of expanding the Shuklaphanta Wildlife Reserve, now a national park in Sudurpaschim Province, thousands of families were displaced. The Ministry of Forest and Environment rehabilitated 5,200 families in camps inside the park, quite close to the wildlife. Citing safety concerns, over the past 22 years, hundreds of families have sought a way out of the national park. Yet they don’t know where to go or what to do next. Shuklaphanta is an example of a recurring national problem. Every year, disasters, both natural and manmade, leave thousands of Nepali families without proper shelters. Seldom has the state taken an initiative for their quick and proper rehabilitation. What’s at stake is the security and well-being of the displaced people. Temporary shelters and settlement areas are not as protective as permanent ones, leaving those displaced from Shuklaphanta vulnerable to the attacks of wild animals and other natural calamities. Dealing with wild animals in the national park has become a daily struggle. And their settlement in the conservation area has also proved detrimental to wildlife. Following last year’s Jajarkot earthquake, hundreds of families had to put up in temporary huts. Come monsoon, things only got worse, holed up as they were in their leaky tents. Lest we forget, during winter, many earthquake victims died due to cold. Pretty much the same could now be true in the case of those displaced by the wildlife reserve. Over the years, multiple judicial commissions—33 in total—have been formed in Sudurpaschim province to address the Shuklaphanta rehabilitation issue. Yet none has done anything substantive other than count the number of displaced families—1,480 of them. But a coordinator for the displaced families claims the number is 2,473, accusing the commission of deliberately downplaying the number of the displaced. Similar inefficiencies plague disaster rehabilitation efforts across the country. Discrepancies in government records and actual numbers often result in relief materials either failing to reach the needy or piling up unused. As concerning is the disappearance of funds meant for rehabilitation programmes. Even after the 2015 earthquake, many donor agencies were concerned that corruption would hamper rebuilding—and it did. The 30th commission in Shuklaphanta proposed to provide each displaced family with 0.338 hectares of land or Rs6 million in compensation. But that recommendation was never seriously considered. As a result, the victims have long lost faith in these commissions. It is thus vital that any new initiative be taken only after gaining the victims’ trust. Rehabilitation of course isn’t something that can be done in haste. It takes time and thought-out measures. Yet proper rehabilitation is seldom the state’s priority, as those in the government prefer to try out much easier temporary fixes rather than rigorously work on the same issue for months or even years on end. The displaced individuals, who are already mentally and physically traumatised, shouldn’t have to suffer more. Each and every Nepali has the constitutional right to live with dignity and it is the state’s responsibility to ensure the same. Really, a government that is incapable of looking after its weak and vulnerable people does not deserve to be called democratic.  \nNepal’s economy that has been facing one after another setbacks since the 2015 earthquake has been struggling to bounce back. Last week, two international agencies—the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB)—announced that Nepal’s economy was poised to improve in the upcoming fiscal year. In this context, the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Nara Bahadur Thapa, former executive director of the research department of Nepal Rastra Bank, to discuss the current state of the national economy. The ADB, in its report last week, anticipated Nepal’s economy to grow by 4.9 percent this fiscal. A few days earlier, a visiting IMF team also painted an improving picture of Nepal’s economy. How do you see these projections?Nepal’s economic growth in the past 2-3 years has remained below 5 percent. But successive governments in their fiscal budgets have been setting the target of 6 to 7 percent growth. Also, the budget this year has aimed for 6 percent growth. In the meantime, two donor agencies have painted an improving picture of our economy. The ADB has anticipated 4.9 percent growth. Also, the IMF’s team that visited Nepal on a fact finding mission has projected better prospects. They expected better yield from the agriculture sector as Nepal is witnessing more rains. Last year, the growth of agriculture was 3 percent. Now they expect the sector may grow by 3.5 to 4 percent and that may lift overall growth. They have cited improvement in tourism and increased energy export as other bases. Based on these grounds, the ADB has projected 4.9 percent economic growth. But even the target of 5 percent growth looks ambitious if you analyse economic data available as of now and the steps taken by government agencies. We have witnessed more rain but that doesn’t always do us good. More rain in the late monsoon often damages paddy at the time of harvest. Second, the heavy monsoon has caused huge losses in our infrastructure such as roads and bridges that are vital to keep the daily lives and trade running. This may impact potential economic growth as some vital highways and roads have been badly damaged. These factors may pose a challenge in achieving the targets set by the government and donor agencies. Another important factor is that the ratio of capital formation to GDP [gross domestic product] is consistently decreasing. It was 33.8 in the fiscal year 2018-19, it decreased to 30.5 in 2019-20, to 29.3 in 2020-21, 29.0 in 2021-22, 25.1 in 2022-23 and 24.5 in 2023-24. How can we expect economic growth when capital formation keeps decreasing. We can’t achieve 6 percent growth without first improving the situation of capital formation. Capital formation in the private sector is on a decline and the government hasn’t been able to boost it. On the other hand, capital expenditure was lower in the past fiscal year in comparison to the previous fiscal. There is no strong sign of increasing capital formation even in the coming year. This is because the government has failed to collect revenue as per its own target. The revenue collection ratio is falling. It has come down to 18 percent of GDP, from 22 percent not so long ago. With this, the government’s funding capacity is continuously declining. It has failed even to fulfil its own duties. For instance, it hasn’t been able to pay health insurance bills and or the contractors. Similarly, credit offtake from private banks to the private sector has not increased from 6 percent. It used to be around 15-16 percent. Also, no substantive initiatives have been taken to improve productivity. For this, government agencies have to cut red tape. The private sector isn’t optimistic. We are talking a lot but not working seriously to lay a strong ground for growth.What are the signs that private investors are pessimistic?There is enough liquidity in the banks, and the interest rate is decreasing, but the private sector is not borrowing. Bankers say there is no demand from the sector. This indicates pessimism. None of the big business houses have launched any big projects in recent times. The government talks a lot about the energy sector but it is not doing power purchase agreements (PPAs) with hydropower project developers. We aren’t doing enough to realise the goal of exporting 10,000MW electricity to India. This shows no serious effort is being made to initiate reforms. The capital market has required some urgent reforms. But the government hasn’t appointed office bearers in the regulatory body for the past seven months. The government hasn’t given permission to issue IPOs and FPOs. Hence, the government is keeping two important sectors—energy and capital market—on hold. All these trends and activities suggest it will be a challenge to achieve even moderate economic growth.You pointed to the policy hurdles but the multilateral agencies have hailed the government for policy reforms. The IMF in its statement has welcomed recent amendments to various laws and the ADB has welcomed “the cautiously accommodative monetary policy”. Don’t these statements reflect reality?While making their positions public, the international agencies follow certain norms and criteria. First, they take macro pictures such as the government’s commitments. They take the pledges made by the government in the investment summit seriously. They think the commitments will be implemented. Second, they don’t want to irk the host country by presenting a bleak picture because they are diplomats. They point out possible pitfalls during bilateral and table talks but present themselves diplomatically while making their official statements public.Remittance, tourism and energy export are taken as major bases for economic growth but all three depend on external factors. How reliable can the projection be?Without trading and increasing exports, we can’t progress economically. We need to export to increase production and create jobs. Export is an engine of economic growth. Anyhow, we must increase exports. About your query, the government should tackle such things by strengthening relations with the countries concerned and devise policies and strategies accordingly.Our economy is increasingly dependent on remittance. How risky is it in the long run?Remittance has become a boon for our economy. It has played a tremendous role in poverty reduction. The first Nepal Living Standard Survey (NLSS) conducted by the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS)—now the National Statistics Office—in 1995-96 showed 42 percent Nepali population living below the poverty line. The latest [fourth] living standard survey has shown the poverty level at 20 percent. It wouldn’t be possible without remittance. Therefore, we can’t undermine the role of remittance in this social transformation. Were not the government’s plans and policies responsible for this achievement?The government role would not have been enough. What government policies have created jobs in Nepal? Are there any schemes worth mentioning? The industrialisation hasn’t increased. It is the industrial sector that creates jobs but the share of the manufacturing sector has come down to 4.87 percent in total GDP. Some years ago, it was nearly 9-10 percent. It shows our economy is being deindustrialised. How can we reduce poverty without providing jobs to the youths? Thus, foreign employment played a vital role in poverty reduction. Second is the role of remittance in maintaining foreign exchange reserves, which is essential to buy things from abroad. We have sufficient foreign exchange reserves because of remittance.Information Technology is now projected as a promising sector in creating jobs and transforming Nepal’s economy. How realistic is this expectation?Four fields can be taken as promising sectors in Nepal—agriculture, tourism, IT and hydropower. The IT sector certainly has a bright future. As our country is land-locked, we have additional challenges in merchandise exports and we can’t be competitive. The IT sector won’t have that barrier so it can be competitive in the international market. But for that the government has to formulate IT-friendly policies. For instance, if a Kathmandu-based Nepali firm wants to sell services in the US, Europe or any other international market, they need liaison offices in those countries. Otherwise, they can’t be competitive and grow. But the government doesn’t provide foreign exchange for them to expand their business abroad.Without this policy reform, Nepalis can’t compete with IT companies from other countries. Similarly, foreign companies need to come and work here so that Nepali youths can learn from them. Foreign banks came to Nepal and Nepali bankers learned. Now Nepali banks are doing good. But our policies aren’t favourable for foreigners interested in setting up IT firms. Also, well-trained IT workers are in shortage. We are progressing but we have to put in extra effort to make transformative changes in this sector.The cooperatives’ scam has emerged as a serious issue. What impact may it cause in the national economy if it’s not resolved soon?The cooperative sector played a vital role in creating financial inclusion in our economy by making 7.3 million people its members. Those who couldn’t do their regular transactions with banks were engaged with cooperatives. If that sector collapses, our state of financial inclusion will decline too. Second, they were major financiers for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME). Cooperatives are directly linked to entrepreneurship through MSMEs. They played a role in making interest rates of banks more competitive as well as banks and financial institutions were under pressure by the interest rates offered by cooperatives. Now they won’t feel the pressure.In this context, many people may resort to informal transactions. According to the 16th periodic plan, nearly 50 percent of Nepal’s economy is informal. We are under pressure to reduce the portion of the informal economy. But the crisis in the cooperative sector may increase the informal economy as those who were involved in cooperatives, which is a formal sector, are likely to do informal transactions with traders or other individuals.Cooperatives are not well regulated and there are anomalies but they are registered in a government agency, pay taxes, have offices and a record system. They brought people in far-flung villages under a formal channel. If the depositors resort to individual transactions, their money will be unsafe. The constitution accepted them as one of the three pillars—along with the government and the private sector—of the country’s economy. The sector expanded its network where there were no economic activities from the government and private sectors. For instance, the government was providing certain services such as distributing fertilisers, crop seeds, sugar through cooperatives. People will now be deprived of these services. Also, the commercial banks might face complications due to the domino effect of the cooperative scam. For instance, if the government seizes the land put up by a cooperative as a collateral in a bank and sells it to return the deposits, the bank might be in trouble.It is also said that cooperatives were becoming platforms for money laundering. How serious was the problem?Cooperatives didn’t seek a source of money from the depositors while accepting big deposits. They weren’t affiliated to the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of the central bank and the Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT). Therefore, there is a problem of money laundering. It can be resolved when they get affiliated with the FIU.What initiatives should be taken to address the problems seen in the cooperative sector?A powerful regulatory authority should be established without delay. The authority should work as a dedicated agency to clear the mess. Then, AML/CFT provisions should be implemented, a credit information centre should be set up and a debt recovery tribunal formed, and deposits guaranteed. The concept of self-regulation isn’t enough. These financial infrastructures are essential. \nThe parliamentary special probe committee formed to investigate cooperatives scam submitted its report last week. The government has already started implementing the report. In this context, Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with the committee chair Surya Thapa for more insights on the probe’s findings and the anomalies in the cooperative sector they saw during the investigation.After your committee submitted the report on cooperatives scam, people have interpreted its findings in different ways. Why the confusion?Our committee prepared, finalised and endorsed the report unanimously. No member registered any dissent. This is an important point. However, people have interpreted its findings a bit differently. The supporters of [Rastriya Swatantra Party chair] Rabi Lamichhane have tried to make it appear like the report has given him a clean chit. They have selectively taken a certain portion of the report which states that Lamichhane’s involvement couldn’t be formally established in the process of transferring funds from cooperatives to the Gorkha Media Network. But a huge amount of money has been provided to the Gorkha Media Network from various cooperatives against the Cooperative Act 2017, which prohibits investment of cooperative deposits to any company. It is seen that Lamichhane is directly involved in spending the funds collected from the cooperatives. Based on that, we have found chair of the media company Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai, the then managing director Rabi Lamichhane, directors Chhabilal Joshi and Kumar Ramtel directly responsible in the misuse of cooperative funds and have asked the government to take action against them as per the existing laws. The aforementioned two aspects are inextricably linked. We didn’t find any evidence of transfer of cooperative funds to Lamichhane’s personal bank account. It is sent to the bank account of the Gorkha Media Network. The KYC form of the Global IME Bank shows that Lamichhane is one of the three holders of the joint account. Any one of the three can issue cheques from the account. The funds invested as loan in the Gorkha Media Network have been transferred to the joint bank account, from where Lamichhane has released money by signing cheques. This is how Lamichhane is directly involved in embezzlement of the cooperative funds. Many argue that as per the cooperative law only those who release money from the cooperatives are held responsible but not those who spend it after it is received at the company. Is that the case?The Cooperative Act 2017 prohibits releasing any loan to a company. But it is sent to the company, where Lamichhane is an owner with 15 percent share and a managing director. And, the money is misused there. An informal statement of GB Rai shows Rs1.20 billion of cooperative deposits has been invested in the media company while our financial analysis shows the amount is Rs654 million. Evidence shows Rs220 million has been directly sent to the media company’s bank account. Depositors have been deprived of their money. Other staff working at the company aren’t responsible but the owners are. They could be charged with cooperative fraud under the Cooperative Act, fraud and duping under the National Penal Code, organised crime cases under the Organised Crime Prevention Act, and money laundering cases under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. Some individuals involved with various cooperatives including Roshni Gurung of a Butwal-based cooperative told the committee that they deposited millions of rupees in the bank account of a person named Rabi Lamichhane. Kumar Ramtel said the person named Rabi Lamichhane is none other than the Rastriya Swatantra Party chair. Still, the committee couldn’t establish the link. What is the complication?The flow of the money shows the connection but documents to link the transactions are not available. We didn’t find documents with Lamichhane’s signatures and fingerprints that needed to be submitted to get a loan. All the seven cooperatives run by GB Rai were releasing loans without following due procedure. But we have successfully traced the flow of the money. The loan amount created in the name of Rabi Lamichhane in Butwal and deposited by Roshni Gurung had reached the Gorkha Media Network’s bank account which was jointly operated by GB Rai, Rabi Lamichhane and Chhabilal Joshi. This is an established fact. The committee didn’t find any document showing the flow of cooperative money to his personal account. But that alone is insufficient to give him a clean chit as a huge sum has been sent to the media company’s bank account jointly run by three people including Lamichhane. Another sum from the Supreme Cooperative has been deposited to the bank account of Gorkha Media Network. The bank voucher shows Roshni Gurung/Rabi Lamichhane as depositors. The amount also goes to the same joint account.Now the government has forwarded the report to the investigation agencies. Do you think the agencies can unearth the missing documents?Our committee worked in a different way to regular House committees. We followed methods of investigation just like the police investigation agencies and government’s prosecution agencies do. We recorded the suspects’ statements, took their fingerprints, and got the signatures to authenticate their statements. I believe this is a new practice by a Nepali parliamentary committee. Sufficient evidence has already been gathered in the past as well. While carrying out this task and preparing the 1,124-page document, we have followed the norms and procedures of an investigation body.During the interrogation, many suspects told the committee that they knew nothing and shifted the responsibility to GB Rai, who is on the run. Those from seven cooperatives–Hamro Nayakrishi Multipurpose Cooperatives; Swarnalaxmi; Supreme; Suryadarshan; Sahara; Samanata and Sano Paila and the officials from Gorkha Media Network gave such answers. Their common answer is, “I don’t know about this, GB Rai does.” Many of them might have been trying to evade their responsibility by blaming Rai. The government has failed to produce Rai. Won’t this investigation be incomplete in his absence?Based on its facts and evidence, the investigation report is complete. Yes, 29 suspects including GB Rai are at large. They are believed to be staying abroad. Their statements have not been recorded. But that doesn’t make the investigation incomplete. We have accessed the database of Gorkha Media Network and other cooperative organisations, collected important documents and analysed them. There is no confusion about the money embezzled in the scam. We have determined a total of Rs2.58 billion from various cooperatives has been misused by investing in several organisations including the Gorkha Media Network, Nature Nest, Nature Herbs, Gorkha Group of Investment, Gorkha Ayurved Company—49 people were responsible for these investments, including GB Rai. Of that, Rs654 million has been invested in Gorkha Media Network. A total of Rs8 billion has been embezzled in the seven cooperatives where Rai is involved. So the investigation is complete. During the interrogation, some office bearers of cooperatives claimed they had no role in the transactions as they were dummy officials and GB Rai and some individuals Rai trusted did everything. How convincing is that?The practice of creating dummy officials, fake documents, false marriages and divorces etcetera is rampant in the cooperative sector. In the seven cooperatives GB Rai is at the centre. He has at least one key person in each of these seven cooperatives as chair or manager and carries out everything through them. In some of them, the chairpersons know nothing. The cooperatives don’t follow any norms, rules and regulations of cooperatives. They work just on the basis of orders they get from Rai or his trusted individuals over the phone. Rai gets advice from a California-based individual named Gyan Bahadur Bamjan. The Cooperative Act prohibits an individual from being a member of more than one cooperative but Rai is involved in at least seven cooperatives as a chair, secretary, vice-chair or patron.The government has decided to implement the report. How should the state agencies work to bring good results?The government should immediately initiate action against four persons—Rabi Lamichhane, GB Rai, Chhabilal Joshi and Kumar Ramtel—as the report has found them responsible for misusing cooperative funds. We have also determined the roles and responsibilities of around 1,000 individuals who were chair, vice-chairs, secretaries, treasurers, account chiefs or others who in decision making roles in 40 cooperatives we were tasked to investigate. They should be brought under investigation and their properties should be seized so as to create an environment to return the depositors’ money.Different arrangements need to be made about those who are in judicial custody. They should be released, their all documents including passports seized and they should be kept under surveillance and allowed to take initiatives to return the depositors’ money. The government, while unveiling the fiscal budget, had announced to take initiatives to return deposits upto Rs500,000 by keeping cooperatives’ assets as collateral. This process should be expedited. Likewise, the government should set up an all-powerful regulatory authority. At present, all the 753 local governments, seven provincial governments and the federal government have the regulatory role. That is pointless. Now a strong dedicated regulatory authority should be formed. The Crisis-ridden Cooperatives Management Committee is there but it should be made more effective by giving it greater executive powers. When a cooperative is in crisis, the regulatory body should take over its management and fix the crisis just like Nepal Rastra Bank does in the banking sector.What patterns of anomalies did you find in the cooperatives?The fundamental idea of a cooperative is to run by its own members based on self-regulation. But a few board members were found to be using all the authority and misusing the funds while members were unaware about the affairs in the organisations. The board members use most of the resources for their relatives and other closed ones. Annual meetings are organised as picnics and wedding parties. In some cases, annual meetings are fake, audit reports, auditors and signatures, all are fake.In the course of preparing the committee report, I have coined terms like ‘cooperative divorce’ and ‘cooperative marriage’. Divorce and marriage documents are prepared based on the fortune of the cooperatives. There was misappropriation of Rs120 million in a cooperative, where Jyoti Gurung was manager, in 2075 BS. Dhan Raj Gurung, who is Nepali Congress Vice-president, divorced his wife Jyoti in 2076 BS. But, in 2077, Dhan Raj presented himself as a guarantor of a loan to Jyoti. Again in 2080, both of them jointly paid back a loan of Rs9.1 million. This is a bit of a trend in the cooperative sector.Do you think we need to reconsider the basic idea of cooperatives as self-regulated organisations?In the report, we haven’t questioned its principle, need and importance. Cooperative sector is vital for our economy. But the concept of self-regulation as stated in the Cooperative Act 2017 has failed. Now, this sector should be overseen by a strong regulatory body. Still, the idea of self-regulation can be given continuity as the members should be allowed to run the cooperatives on their own but their activities should be strictly regulated by a powerful authority. Moreover, the cooperatives that do big transactions should be regulated by the central bank.Why did the present regulatory bodies fail?There were over 50 lawmakers who proudly identified themselves as office bearers of certain cooperatives. They over-emphasised self-regulation and undermined the role of regulatory bodies. Individuals like GB Rai and other fraudsters benefited from that. Therefore, we recommended stringent laws and a stronger regulatory authority. \nNepal is marking its ninth Constitution Day on Thursday. The country’s two largest parties—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—formed a coalition government a month ago with a commitment to reviewing and amending the constitution. In this context, Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal and Binod Ghimire sat down with constitutional expert Purna Man Shakya to discuss the good and bad aspects of the constitution amendment process.The Congress and the UML have floated a proposal to amend the constitution. Is the time ripe to make changes in our statute?Generally, constitutions are reviewed after around a decade of their implementation. So, we have come to the stage of reviewing whether our constitution has functioned properly. However, the sudden announcement of the amendment is premature, as this is a serious business. In our case, the constitution can’t be amended just based on the interest of one or two parties. It requires a national consensus. There should be an understanding among the political parties represented in Parliament. And, a sort of consensus even among the people’s level is important as there was huge public involvement in making this constitution. Sentiment of various communities must be respected while making any changes in the national charter. What can be the modality of seeking consensus at the people’s level? Should a draft be prepared and opened up for debate?While making changes in the constitution, some issues might be technical and not of interest to common people. But if any changes are made in policy issues that can alter our country’s structural dynamics, the concerned communities must be consulted. Just the present strength of the political parties represented in Parliament is no guarantee that they truly represent people. For instance, the Maoists emerged as the largest party through the election in 2008. But it has been shrunk to a distant third in the House. However, we can’t conclude from this that the people have discarded the party’s agenda. The Maoists might have been discredited due to their activities and failure in delivery but people might still favour the agenda they once championed. Similar is the case with other parties. Therefore, we have to consider broader consensus both in Parliament as well as the people’s level.How challenging is it to enter the constitution amendment process?Any amendment calls for a two-thirds majority in the House of Representatives as well as the National Assembly in the federal parliament. If an issue is linked to provincial authority, it should be endorsed by the majority [four] of seven provinces. So, this is not easy. Therefore, the parties should tread carefully.You mentioned earlier that constitution amendments without a review process is not a right step. Could you elaborate?The right way is to first have broad understanding among the top leaders of political forces on the issues and then constitute a panel of experts to conduct a comprehensive study on that. Such studies are conducted through two methods—doctrinal and non-doctrinal. The doctrinal method analyses related literature and principles on theoretical approach while the non-doctrinal method studies the public sentiments and opinions through surveys and interactions, and comes up with certain methodologies with the help of subject experts. Through such study, the experts identify the issues and recommend the ways to the politicians. This is the right process.There are also arguments that reviewing the constitution without even bringing it into full-fledged implementation is wrong. Based on the practice during these years, we have concluded that certain provisions didn’t work properly. It is true that we are talking about making changes in the constitution without even implementing certain provisions. First we have to give the system an opportunity to work in a full-fledged way. Then, we can evaluate whether it worked. Any move to dissolve the system without properly implementing it will create divisions and invite another conflict. A question that is often asked: Is there a problem with our constitution or with our politicians? People can change the constitution but the constitution can’t change the people. Therefore, a constitution should be developed also on the basis of the nature of people in the country who use it. If our political parties and the politicians had reformed themselves, we might not have had to discuss constitutional changes time and again. We should have made the system strong for more effective checks and balances and made leaders and officials more accountable. The ruling parties reason that the constitution amendment became necessary to ensure political stability.When a federal government is changed, its aftershocks are immediately seen in all seven provincial governments. It directly impacts development and other activities across the country. It’s a flaw in our party system but we have to find a solution in the system. We see people raising voices for two things—stability and retirement of old politicians. As Nepali politicians never retire voluntarily, we have to address it through the system. Direct election of executive head can be one way to address this problem. People have found local governments more effective than federal and provincial governments. It is because chiefs and representatives of local governments are directly elected and they can serve the full five-year term.Once people are given the right to elect heads of government, they won’t elect old faces such as KP Oli, Sher Bahadur Deuba and Prachanda [Pushpa Kamal Dahal], who have been tested multiple times. It will serve two purposes—first, it gives stability and second, it allows popular leaders to emerge in place of the old ones. The old leaders have maintained control over national politics through their huge party organisations. But when people directly elect presidents and chief ministers their grip over party organisations can’t be decisive in national politics. For that we have to amend the constitution.However, again, an expert team needs to thoroughly study the pros and cons of such changes. But what I can say based on the general study of public perception is that we can first go for direct election of executive heads at the provincial level. In the next phase we can go for direct presidential election at the federal level.What went wrong in the practice of the three-tier federal system?While adopting federalism, the basic idea was to allow the local governments to oversee local matters while the provincial governments would handle wide ranges of issues related to agriculture, industry, forest, education and health, etcetera. If the two sub-national governments handle these things, people don’t need to come to the centre seeking solutions to their problems. In such a scenario, the federal government can focus on important affairs such as foreign relations, defence, telecommunication, currency, national infrastructure projects and inter-provincial affairs. Such division of powers would automatically create specialisation in the respective governments.But the federal system is not implemented as per that spirit. Provinces aren’t allowed to exercise their rights. People are still travelling to Kathmandu all the way from remote districts even for basic things. The constitution has mandated the provinces to maintain law and order in their respective provinces but the federal government hasn’t allowed them to have their own police forces. Provinces without police have become like administrative units. The centre has a huge bureaucracy in Kathmandu. It is high time that the centre delegates authority to provinces as per the constitutional spirit. Federal lawmakers have huge interest in local development activities because it is directly related to their election. They don’t want to lose this influence. The interest of federal lawmakers however contradicts with the constitution.There is also a belief that the local level has authority in areas where they can’t work effectively, for instance they are mandated to oversee the education system up to grade 12 while provinces don’t have much role. Do you think such jurisdictional matters need to be reviewed and provinces should be given more authority?That’s right. First of all, we should be clear that there is no point in adopting a federal system if we don’t want provinces because we had central and local levels even in the past. Provincial layer is an integral part of federalism. So, we have to think about transferring certain rights from local to provincial level because the local units don’t have expertise to oversee education up to grade 12 on their own. Our local units are traditionally trained in local development activities. But now they are entrusted with the responsibility of not only overseeing education and health issues but also with legislative and judicial functions. They haven’t been able to play that role. We should think about transferring some roles from local to provincial levels. Likewise, the centre should be ready to allow the provinces to exercise their rights bestowed by the constitution. It is time to strengthen the provinces.You said direct election of executive heads in provinces could end instability at the provincial level. But what if a popular leader got elected chief minister but other political parties won majority seats in the provincial assemblies? In such a situation, the rival parties may not help the chief minister pass a budget or policies from the assembly.Yes, there are strengths and weaknesses of all systems. Such problems can be resolved because we see similar situations in other countries as well. Parties can’t prolong the deadlock in the House because they will be blamed for the impasse. One basis is that our local units are doing well under executive heads. So, we can practise it for a decade in the provinces and then apply it to the federal level based on that experience.Many forces and groups that aren’t happy with the present constitution, which was basically a compromise document. Once the constitution amendment process is open, they are certain to revive their demands. Will the situation be manageable?If the rights of historically marginalised communities are curtailed, they will certainly retaliate. If you try to go against the federal republic system and policy of inclusion, it may invite new conflicts. The proportional representation system is not a problem. Leaders made it unpopular by misusing it. We should find solutions to stop its misuse. We shouldn’t forget that this constitution is not only a constitution but also a key document of our peace process. This is not perfect but it was essential to end the conflict. Many say that while making a document of compromise, our constitution hasn’t followed the principles of constitutionalism. For instance, the hearing system is something unusual in a parliamentary system. As a constitutional expert, do you think we should also think about fixing such deviations?You are right. When we couldn’t change the people, we tried to add additional features as a measure to check the wrongdoings. Our leaders make appointments in key constitutional bodies guided by their personal and partisan interests. We copied the hearing practice from the presidential system with a view to check the leaders’ arbitrary appointments. It hasn’t been that effective. Therefore, we have proposed to give continuity to the hearing for political appointments but not in the appointments of judges because lawmakers don’t have the expertise to examine judges’ competence. Since lawmakers are mainly guided by the party’s whip and top leaders’ instructions, it rather increases political interference even in the judiciary. We have thus proposed to stop the hearing process for judges’ appointments.Many say that the judiciary hasn’t been federalized even though all other sectors have been restructured as per the three-tier federal system. Why this exception for the judiciary?Oh, you dragged me to a sensitive topic. One thing we shouldn’t forget is that we adopted a federal system not to unify small countries. We were already a united country. We adopted it to better manage our social diversity by involving all the communities in the governing system. We at the same time have to safeguard the country from disintegration. Judiciary, the national army and Nepali language are our institutional arrangements that can play a unifying role. Therefore, we didn’t make much changes in these three aspects.Some instances show that Nepal’s federalism might have been a bit more effective had the judiciary worked proactively. For instance, the court hasn’t decided even the cases filed by provinces years ago. What do you think about the judiciary’s role in this connection?Yes, those cases are still undecided. In the Constituent Assembly, the Maoist party had registered a proposal to form a separate constitutional court. The justices who were leading the judiciary at the time opposed the idea. It was later rejected. Then the idea to have a separate constitutional bench was included as a compromise deal. But it has failed to work effectively. It failed to decide election-related disputes. We have to review its jurisdiction. They have decided certain cases when there is public pressure. For instance they decided cases like House dissolution because there was constant public scrutiny. But they haven’t shown any interest in other important cases where constitutional interpretation is needed. Of late, a strong opinion is being built in favour of forming a separate constitutional court. These issues are being discussed seriously. This issue may emerge if the constitution amendment process begins.What we can infer from your analysis is that the constitution amendment process is not that easy. What are the basic things that should be and can be done in the constitution amendment at this stage?First, we should change the form of governance at the provincial level and go for a directly elected executive head. With this there will be no change in government in provinces after changes at the centre. The governments in provinces can work for five years with certainty. Second, we can transfer the powers that the local units have failed to exercise to provinces. And, the centre should allow the provinces to exercise the concurrent rights. By doing this the centre can reduce the overwhelming burden on it. While the provinces can play an implementing role, the federation can play a supervisory role. These things need to be fixed. We need some amendments to the constitution and some new laws for this. \nNepal has often earned global recognition for its progressive policies and inclusive stance on LGBTQIA+ rights. But do the global accolades Nepal has earned in terms of its progressiveness reflect the actual experiences of queer people here? The Post’s Aarati Ray sat down with Manisha Dhakal, executive director of the Blue Diamond Society and a leading advocate for LGBTQIA+ rights in South Asia for over 23 years.Nepal is often hailed for its progressive stance on queer rights, both in South Asia and globally. With over two decades of queer rights advocacy, how accurate do you find this portrayal?Many activists and commentators do describe Nepal as being progressive on queer rights. While this is partly true, especially when we consider the legal frameworks, the reality at the grassroots is quite different. On the one hand, Nepal’s constitution recognises LGBTQIA+ identities. Articles 12 and 18 mandate that “gender identity” be acknowledged on citizenship certificates, while Article 42 promises affirmative action and participation in government for sexual and gender minorities. Court decisions in Nepal, too, have been favourable for LGBTQIA+ rights, and unlike many former British colonies with Section 377-type laws that criminalise queer communities, Nepal has no such legal barriers. So, indeed, there are opportunities for activism, and progress has been made, particularly in terms of legal recognition. But, again, the rights enshrined in the constitution and affirmed by the courts have not been realised at the grassroots level. We are stuck with a limited focus, primarily on citizenship. The state claims that we’ve been given the right to identity and legal recognition, but even this is not fully realised. For example, the process of obtaining citizenship based on self-identification remains difficult, with government officials still unclear on how to implement these provisions. The broader narrative of Nepal being progressive is built on a superficial understanding of the situation.In August, Nepal’s Supreme Court ruled that Rukshana Kapali, a transgender woman, should be legally recognised as a woman on all documents without medical verification. How does this decision impact the future of LGBTQIA+ rights in Nepal?Rukshana’s case is a prominent victory, highlighting the judiciary’s support for LGBTQIA+ rights, especially compared to those of the executive and legislative branches. This ruling lays a strong foundation for similar future cases and will undoubtedly help in future activism. However, it’s important to note that the decision applies only to Kapali, meaning others will still need to go through the courts to have their gender identity legally recognised. How long must transgender individuals continue to endure lengthy court processes just to obtain citizenship?Even outside the courts, the bureaucratic hurdles—from medical reassignment surgeries to invasive checkups and long delays from the CDO (District Administration Office) to the Ministry of Home Affairs—can take years, with no guarantee of getting preferred names on legal documents. In many cases, even after completing the process, the names are inaccurately changed, such as altering Ram to Rama instead of the preferred name, like Manisha.We [Blue Diamond Society] get 15-20 complaints each year, primarily from transgender women, regarding difficulties in obtaining citizenship.The Supreme Court’s recent decision on same-sex marriage in Nepal has attracted global attention and gotten a positive response. Are there any limits to the court’s decision?After a long and arduous process, we secured temporary registration for same-sex marriages. On June 28, 2023, the Supreme Court, in the Pinky Gurung vs. Government of Nepal case, issued an interim order instructing the government to temporarily register same-sex marriages, including for those with “other” gender markers. That said, the Civil Code adopted in 2017 still defines marriage as a union between a ‘man’ and a ‘woman’.We, as a community, are pleased with the government’s temporary registration process. Yet it falls short of offering full marriage rights, including those related to property, adoption, and tax exemptions. While the court’s decision sets a supportive precedent, lack of clarity about the rights associated with the temporary certificate leaves many in limbo. So far, only around five couples have registered, and many in the community are hesitant to do so.The question remains: Can this temporary registration truly grant us the same recognition as heterosexual marriages? While the decision has garnered global praise, the LGBTQIA+ community on the ground continues to feel cheated of true equality. Our ultimate goal is to amend the Civil Code so that marriage is defined as a union between two individuals, rather than being restricted to one between male and female.Why do many court decisions on queer rights in Nepal, like of same-sex marriages, remain in limbo? Is this due to the government and courts trying to appease both conservative and progressive groups, or is it just a performative gesture of inclusivity?There are multiple factors at play. I think some responsibility also falls on activists. For example, when fighting for legal recognition since 2008, we should have advocated not only for the “third gender” or “other” but also for individuals who have transitioned from male to female or female to male. What’s more, policymakers and bureaucrats still lack awareness about human rights principles related to minority groups like the LGBTQIA+ community. Even though Nepal has ratified international conventions on human rights, these commitments have not been prioritised by lawmakers, which leads to this state of limbo and half-hearted inclusivity.As for the internal thought processes of bureaucrats and lawmakers, it’s hard to say. Many of them might still believe that the LGBTQIA+ community shouldn’t be granted full rights, so they engage in performative actions—appearing supportive on the surface to attract global attention but hesitating to fully advance our rights. This could explain why progress seems to stall midway.Queer rights have received some legal recognition. But how are they reflected in terms of social and cultural acceptance in Nepal?Legal changes and social acceptance need to go hand in hand. If we only focus on legal reforms without addressing societal attitudes, there will be no real change. We’ve seen this play out—there is legal recognition of gender identity, and temporary registration for same-sex marriage is available. Yet people struggle to fully realise these rights because of deep-rooted discrimination within families and society.In Nepal, a socially and culturally driven society, where family, relatives, and festivals play a major role, social acceptance is often more important than legal acceptance. When it comes to cultural acceptance, biases still persist. For example, it feels like we’re allowed to express ourselves openly only during the Pride Month in June. When we try to participate in other celebrations like Teej or Gaijatra, society often reacts negatively, asking why we need to “spoil” their festivals. This shows that social change is still lagging, despite the progress in legal rights.You mentioned that the queer community is often given the surface level of legal recognition. How is the state of the exercise of fundamental rights for LGBTQIA+ people in Nepal?Labelled as ‘gender and sexual minorities’, our broader struggles are ignored. When we raise concerns about poverty, food insecurity, or unemployment, the response we often get from government institutions and stakeholders is, “This isn’t our issue; it’s a gender problem.”We are just as much a part of society as anyone else. Issues like climate change, housing, and poverty affect us too. We want to be included in solutions, whether it’s participating in climate programs or being involved in community initiatives. Unfortunately, lawmakers and stakeholders often overlook that we are just as human as heterosexuals, with needs that go beyond legal recognition on paper.What are some aspects of the queer community that have not received enough attention in media narratives, and what tends to be unnecessarily highlighted?As I’ve mentioned before, the narrative surrounding our community often focuses heavily on issues like citizenship, while overlooking other important aspects of our lives. What’s missing is the correct representation of our contributions in various fields. Many LGBTQIA+ individuals are doctors, and experts in different professions, yet their accomplishments are only rarely acknowledged or represented. Instead, the focus often falls on the unfortunate image of some members of the community begging on the streets, which goes viral on social media.Another issue is the way we are predominantly associated with sex and sexuality. While these are important aspects of human identity, we are much more than that. We have other needs and rights that deserve attention. Unfortunately, the media tends to fixate on sexual aspects of the LGBTQIA+ community, reinforcing stereotypes. It’s time for the media to move beyond this narrow portrayal and include us in broader discussions that reflect the full scope of our lives.How has the current narrative of progressiveness in Nepal impacted real change for the LGBTQIA+ community?It’s time to move beyond this narrative of progressiveness. True progress should lead to further development, not be a barrier to it. Unfortunately, the current narrative seems to be stagnating.For instance, when we raise issues with the government, the response often is, “We’ve already given you the right to citizenship. You’re getting citizenship now.” Even when I travel people sometimes ask, “You’ve got citizenship, right? Things are becoming progressive.” This narrative of progressiveness has become an excuse for the government to claim they’ve done enough and to avoid further action.This surface-level progressiveness is used to showcase Nepal as forward-thinking internationally, but it hasn’t translated into real change for people at the grassroots. It also impedes activists’ efforts by providing the government with a shield against criticism. Until this narrative of progressiveness evolves into genuine, accountable action that goes beyond court decisions and performative gestures, it will continue to be a barrier to actual progress. \nThe weather will be partly to generally cloudy in Koshi Province, Madhesh Province, Bagmati Province and Gandaki Province and partly cloudy to mainly fair in the rest of the provinces on Thursday.Light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is likely to occur in some places of Koshi Province, Bagmati Province and Gandaki Province and at a few places of Madhesh Province and to occur in one or two places of the rest of the provinces, according to the Metrological Forecasting Division.There are chances of heavy rainfall at one or two places of Koshi Province and Bagmati Province.Tonight, it is forecasted to be partly to generally cloudy in Koshi Province, Madhesh Province, Bagmati Province, Gandaki Province, and Lumbini Province, and partly cloudy to mainly fair in the rest of the provinces.
