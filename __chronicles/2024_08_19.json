Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nDespite slowed economic growth, Nepal’s external sector appears stronger than ever, thanks to remittances, tourism and the appreciation of the US dollar.Nepal’s three external indicators—foreign exchange reserve, remittance earnings, and tourism income, which represent all international economic transactions between residents of the country—reached a historic high in the last fiscal year that ended mid-July.Conversely, the country’s statistical body, the National Statistics Office, has projected Nepal’s economic growth to be at a meagre 3.87 percent for 2023-24 due to the poor performance of the internal sector. According to experts, the mismatch is due to political uncertainty and growing corruption, as the external sector's growth did not support the internal sector. “It’s good that tourism income has grown. This will generate jobs,” said Nara Bahadur Thapa, former executive director at Nepal Rastra Bank, the country’s central bank. “But at the same time, growing remittance earnings means no job prospects at home. But the money sent by migrant workers has boosted foreign exchange reserves to an all-time high.”Though Nepal is in a remittance trap, the country could turn this into an opportunity by investing in the real sector. “The best option to channel remittances is to bring the private sector on board for investment in the productive sector,” said Thapa.Experts said that since the interest rate on credit has dropped significantly due to the huge amount of liquidity, investment is all that the country needs now. In the last fiscal year, Nepal’s gross foreign exchange reserves increased 32.6 percent to Rs2.04 trillion, a historic high. According to experts, such a trend in a least-developed country indicates no investment. According to the central bank report released on Sunday, remittance inflows increased 16.5 percent to Rs1.44 trillion in the last fiscal year, the highest amount on record.The remittances have been increasing because youth are leaving. In the last fiscal year, foreign employment permits were issued for 741,302 individuals (460,103 first-time and 281,199 renewed). The number is a slight reduction from 774,976 in the previous fiscal year.Under the service account, travel income, or expenditure made by foreign tourists, increased 32.1 percent to Rs82.33 billion in the review year, the highest revenue on record. The total number of tourist arrivals increased to 1.12 million in the last fiscal year from 862,992 in the previous fiscal year.The balance of payments remained at a surplus of Rs502.49 billion in the review year.With the upbeat external sector, the internal sector has remained dismal.“This is because the private sector investment has been shrinking for the last two years,” said Chandra Dhakal, president of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the apex private sector body. He was speaking at an interaction in Kathmandu on Sunday.“As Nepal’s industrial capacity is under 40 percent. The private sector investment that contributes 86 percent to the economy has shrunk. This will naturally not generate employment opportunities.”He said that the demand for workers has boomed in the country, where the private sector has thrived. The World Bank said in its recent report that frequent political changes, a significant drag on businesses for over a decade, have dampened private investment. Thriving corruption and lack of accountability have stalled growth and forced tens of thousands of young Nepalis to try their luck abroad.Thapa, a former official at the central bank, said that with billions of dollars in the banks, the incumbent government has an opportunity to take advantage of it.Nepal is currently ruled by an unusual coalition of the two largest parties and this brings both challenges and opportunities. “The government has to facilitate the private sector. It has to ask the private sector to bring forward ready-to-invest projects,” said Thapa. The capital market is gaining momentum. “Through initial public offerings (IPOs) and follow-on public offers (FPOs), the government can facilitate raising money and enable the private sector to invest in the productive sectors that create jobs,” said Thapa. However, political wrangling has paralysed the country.The Securities Board of Nepal (SEBON) and Nepal Tourism Board have been headless for months. Nepal Electricity Authority has yet to open the door for signing the power purchase agreement with the big developers even though the country has huge loanable funds.“The government and the private sector both have to invest,” said Dhakal. “For every rupee the government spends, the private sector has been spending Rs5.”Economists say that the government’s capital injection into the economy would encourage the private sector to pump the investment.Over the years, private investment has remained sluggish. For example, the import restriction imposed by the government two years ago discouraged the private sector from spending, decreasing capital in the market and intermediate goods imports. As a result, public consumption and investment contracted, ultimately impacting the government’s revenue collection.Economists and statisticians say Nepal, which is set to graduate from the least developed countries by 2026, does not have the environment to achieve double-digit economic growth in the immediate future due to low investment from the government and the private sector.The country’s statistical office recently said that, given the ongoing investment, Nepal’s growth rate will neither slow down nor grow. It will remain static. According to economists, everything from wages to business growth and social security to other state benefits will remain static, which will encourage youth to try their luck abroad. \nWhen the political parties in the House of Representatives appear divided over the idea of amending the constitution, vaguely floated by the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, the Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal (JSP-Nepal), has said it would welcome it provided the party’s demands are addressed.KP Sharma Oli became prime minister based on a July 1 agreement reached between the Congress and the UML. In the same deal, the two largest parties also agreed to take turns to head the government and amend the constitution, purportedly to ensure political stability, among other things. “The national consensus government will prioritise reviewing the strengths, weaknesses, and complications observed in implementing the constitution and will focus on amending the constitution and enacting related laws to ensure political stability,” Prime Minister Oli stated in Parliament on July 21, during his floor test. Some parties, including the CPN (Maoist Centre), the third largest party in the House of Representatives, have raised serious concerns about the intentions behind the proposed amendments, accusing the big parties of attempting to revoke some progressive features of the statute. Maoist Centre chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal was ousted from the position of prime minister on July 12 after the two largest parties joined hands to form a government. The Rastriya Swatantra Party, the fourth largest in the lower house, has also questioned the motives behind the Congress-UML deal. The JSP-Nepal, however, is comparatively more open to the idea of revising the constitution. The party has demanded that its certain concerns must be addressed should there be any amendments to the statute. The party has called for the formation of a constitutional review commission comprised of experts to propose amendments. The party’s central committee meeting held from August 11 to 14 decided to support amendments based on the recommendations of an elite commission. The party has also demanded amending the constitution to place local units under the provincial government. Likewise, it has demanded a directly elected executive head, a fully proportional election system, a federal justice system with proportional and inclusive representation, and self-governance based on national and ethnic identity. Yadav, who led a different political party, had submitted these proposals in the Constituent Assembly while drafting the statute as well.“The names of provinces should reflect their identities,” mentions the decision of the party’s central committee meeting.Many of JSP-Nepal’s demands related to amendments echo Yadav’s previous positions. Although the party had compromised on its demands during the constitution-making process for consensus, it is now advocating for a directly elected executive head, among other things. “Most of our current demands are the same ones that we had registered during the constitution-drafting process,” Prakash Adhikari, a party leader and a federal lawmaker from the party, told the Post. “If the two major parties address our demands, we are open to revising the constitution.”But Chandrakishore, a political analyst from Madhesh, finds the JSP-Nepal’s demands as irrelevant. Except for the directly elected executive head, the issues the party now has raised are old ones, he told the Post.“The party’s latest demands are the issues of the Madhesh Movement, but Yadav then chose to align with the ruling parties and betrayed the movement,” Chandrakishore told the Post. “Now he is again raising the same old issues in an attempt to placate the Madheshi people.” “If JSP-Nepal wants to truly engage with the people, it needs a leadership overhaul. Repeating past demands won’t work.” Despite lending support to Prime Minister Oli during the trust vote, the party was not accommodated in the Cabinet, while its splinter faction, the Janata Samajbadi Party holds a key portfolio in the Oli government. After Ashok Rai, then federal chair of the party, along with six lawmakers, split the party on May 5 to form the Janata Samajbadi Party, the JSP-Nepal’s strength in the House has diminished markedly.The party concluded its general convention in June unanimously electing Yadav as party chair. Even after over two months of the convention, the party is still to elect its office bearers, though it has formed a central executive council. A party’s central committee meeting last week demanded that the parliamentary and provincial constituencies be redrawn based on the latest census. Likewise, the party has also called for proportional representation in the National Assembly. Similarly, the party also vows to dissolve District Coordination Committees, arguing they are redundant under the federal structure.  \nNepal witnessed an alarming rise in the suicide cases in the last fiscal year.According to data provided by the Nepal Police, 7,223 people killed themselves in the fiscal year 2023-024, which is the highest ever recorded in a year.“Around 20 people killed themselves on an average every 24-hour in the last fiscal year,” said Dr Pomawati Thapa, chief of the Non-communicable Disease and Mental Health Section at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “The number is the highest ever recorded in any fiscal year.”Nepal is among the countries with the highest suicide rates.Police data show that 6,993 people killed themselves in the fiscal year 2022-023, followed by 6,792 in the fiscal year 2021-022.As many as 7,117 people took their own lives in the fiscal year 2020-021, during which the country witnessed the second and third wave of the coronavirus pandemic. Reducing one-third of premature mortality from non-communicable diseases through prevention, treatment and promotion of mental health and well-being is among the UN-backed Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) targets to which Nepal is committed.Experts say the suicide rate is an indicator of premature mortality within the SDGs, which are a follow-up to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).“At the time when the government committed to SDGs in 2015, around 16 people took their own lives every 24 hours,” said Basudev Karki, a consultant psychiatrist. “Now the number has risen to 20. Our government had committed to reduce the suicide rate to 9.7 per 100,000 each year by 2022, but this number rose to 24, and last year it increased further to 25.”The government aims to reduce the suicide rate to 4.7 per 100,000 population by 2030 to meet the SDG targets, but as the deadline nears, more people are killing themselves every day. Mental health experts say people do not attempt suicide for any single reason, but rather due to a complex mix of factors including the rising cost of living and struggle to manage even their most basic needs such as food, housing, healthcare, and job security.Whatever the cause, suicides and suicide attempts have a ripple effect, impacting not only the individual but also families, friends, colleagues, communities, and societies, according to themA study carried out by the Nepal Health Research Council before the start of the pandemic shows that more than 10 percent of the adult population had mental issues in their lifetime and 4.3 percent were undergoing some sort of mental crisis.The prevalence of suicidality, including current suicidal thoughts, past suicide attempts, and a future likelihood of suicidal thoughts, was found to be prevalent in the 7.2 percent population.“Even those individuals who appear healthy on the outside could also be struggling with serious mental health problems,” said Karki. “People generally do not like to talk about mental health issues due to the social stigma attached, and lack of awareness. To tackle the growing mental health problems, authorities concerned have to take multiple approaches.”Meanwhile, officials at the Ministry of Health and Population said that they are aware of the growing burden of mental health issues and the rising suicide rate and have been taking various measures to address the problems.“Along with providing free medications for mental health problems at state-run health facilities, we have been taking several other measures that include imparting mental health screening training for health workers,” said Thapa, chief of the Non-communicable Disease and Mental Health Section at the division. “We have been working to declare two local units—Palungtar Municipality of Gorkha and Bagchaur Municipality of Salyan—as model municipalities for mental health.”According to officials, various mental health programmes will be rolled out in these local units, including screening for mental health problems and training for health workers, community workers, teachers, female community health volunteers, and others. Awareness campaigns will be launched, and health facilities will be strengthened to provide basic services for mental health problems.“This programme will be launched as a pilot and will be gradually expanded to other local units,” said Thapa. “The main aim of the programme is to encourage the local bodies to take responsibility for addressing the growing mental health issues. We will also launch an awareness drive to reduce the suicide rate, alcohol consumption, and substance use.”The World Health Organisation says one in four people in the world are affected by mental or neurological disorders at some point in their lives, and around 450 million people currently suffer from such conditions, placing mental disorders among the leading causes of ill health and disability worldwide.If you or someone you know is considering suicide, please contact the following helplines.Nepal Mental Hospital suicide hotline: 1166Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital suicide prenvention hotline: 9840021600:Patan Hospital crisis helpline for suicide prevention: 9813476123The Transcultural Psychosocial Organisation: 16600102005 \nCPN (Unified Socialist) leader Ram Kumari Jhakri was among the most active leaders involved in the formation of the party after split with the CPN-UML in 2021. Three years on, she is now the most vocal leader calling for a unification of the two parties. Why didn’t the new party perform well, and what made her lobby for a party merger? Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat with former minister Jhakri for more insights.You worked actively to form the CPN (Unified Socialist), but the party couldn’t perform well. It couldn’t even become a national party from the general elections. What went wrong?We formed the CPN (Unified Socialist) out of compulsion. When Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli—who was prime minister at the time as well—dissolved the House of Representatives in December 2020, we firmly stood against his move, saying that it sowed the seeds of political instability. We staged huge protests and moved the Supreme Court against the decision of Oli, our party chair at the time. I was among the petitioners. Once the top court reinstated the House, we expected the party to move smoothly. Unfortunately, that couldn’t happen. The party establishment led by Oli and the rival faction took extreme actions against each other. The agitating faction announced action against the party chair, and the party establishment expelled us from the party itself. When Oli dissolved the House a second time, we protested the move as it brought instability. We were in favour of transforming the party through intra-party struggle, but the situation took some unexpected turns. We didn’t quit the party with a lofty plan of making a new revolutionary organisation. We were compelled to do so.Our new party accommodated many genuine leaders who had been sidelined in the UML. But ultimately, old leaders heavily dominated the new party’s central committee. They were active leaders of their time but were out of touch with the new, changing context. Young leaders didn’t get space in party committees. I proposed recruiting at least 40 percent members under 40 years in the central committee and over 50 percent members under 30 years in the district committees. I made a 29-year-old leader the chair of the district committee in my home district. In 42 days, I attended 36 district conventions where youths in their 30s were elected district committee chairs. I tried to reach out to municipalities to promote youths in the party chapters. But at the central level, old faces dominated party committees. That didn’t attract people to the party or impress the general public. Thus, it failed to gather steam right from the beginning.Many think that Madhav Kumar Nepal’s selection as party chief was a wrong move since he had led the UML for 15 years and become prime minister, and people didn’t find novelty in the new party. Do you think so too?Madhav Kumar Nepal has been the most active leader in the party since its inception. Whatever the party has achieved so far is because of him. But a party leader must mobilise teams with defined roles and responsibilities and continuously motivate and engage them in result-oriented tasks. He works a lot but doesn’t mobilise teams effectively. Observers say the Unified Socialist was formed due to the personality clash between top leaders and that it lacked a national agenda and a clear policy to prove the need for a new party. Do you feel so?Our immediate agenda was safeguarding the constitution and ensuring political stability in the country. We protested the House dissolution guided by the same policy. But when provincial governments were made like satellites of the federal government, we couldn’t play any role in stabilising them.The UML is guided by the policy of People’s Multiparty Democracy, propounded by the late Madan Bhandari. There was a debate on further enhancing the policy in the changed context. A large section of Left intellectuals were interested in contributing to that. We could have engaged them in the process. But our party stopped the debate on that topic as well. We missed the chance of engaging many critical individuals in the discourse and having a relatively different policy. When in the UML, we practised direct elections of party representatives and leaders from the conventions. Unfortunately, leaders of the new party, Unified Socialist, made a statute that gave powers to the party leadership to nominate party secretariat, office bearers and other members. Leaders would pick those who are loyal to them. This regressive approach killed competition in the party.You are known to prefer a more proactive work and decision-making approach. There are rumours that you have been fed up with the party’s lacklustre style and are mulling to join the mother party, UML.If I were to decide only from a personal perspective, I would have done so much earlier because I had multiple opportunities in the past. But I am for party merger because I don’t see any relevance of running multiple retail shops under communist banners because we are not substantially different from each other in terms of policies. Our electoral system has also made it necessary. The Unified Socialist can’t run like this. We must accept reality and decide—merging our party with the UML is better than running it this way. But it seems that the top leaders of the twin parties are still bitter about each other.True, the bitterness lingers on, mainly among the top leaders. We have also made some mistakes. The UML offered some opportunities to the Unified Socialist, and we should have made some offers to capitalise on the favourable situation. At one time, UML leaders proposed our party chair as a candidate for the vacant post of the country’s President. We should have devised our own proposal and made a win-win deal. But we ran away and squandered the opportunity. If Madhav Kumar Nepal had become president on the UML’s proposal, our party might have been reunited with the UML much earlier. I also took an initiative to that end but in vain. Later also, UML chair Oli visited our party chair’s residence to have our party on board the government. But the reaction from our side ruined things. We are certainly not responding to the UML responsibly. Rather than irritate the UML, we must turn each positive gesture into an opportunity for party unity.One more factor is blocking the unity between the two parties. There are a large number of second-rung leaders in the UML who can’t directly confront Oli. They are now encouraging former President Bidya Devi Bhandari to join active politics and trying to make decisions in their favour through her. Oli knows these leaders will support Nepal when he returns to the UML. Why would he [Oli] then merge the fringe party and create another power centre against himself? He knows Madhav Kumar Nepal will challenge him with the backing of the dissidents. It is natural for a leader to think twice before allowing another leader of your stature to create a parallel power centre within the organisation. Even I would have thought twice. This is a major factor hindering party unity.Your party chair and other key leaders seem quite close to CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal and critical of UML chair Oli. Moreover, Oli often lambasts Madhav Kumar Nepal publicly. Will they still merge the parties?In principle, our party is open for unity with any Left party. But party cadres won’t join the Maoist Centre. If our leadership decides to merge the party with the Maoists, a huge number of our party cadres will join the UML. Unity between the UML and the Unified Socialist is natural because we grew up in the same background and orientation. But we are quite different from Maoists. Several groups trying to form new political outfits have failed to emerge as a major political force and sustain themselves. You worked in a big party for years and also helped establish a new one. What are the challenges of forming a new political organisation in Nepal?Political parties sustain if they evolve with society. If you trace the history of the Nepal’s Congress and communist parties, you will see how they have evolved over the past seven decades. They competed against each other but joined hands to fight autocratic forces towards establishing democracy. They have done hundreds of progressive things in society. Their major fault is that they have multiple entry points but no exit policy. The only exit way is the death of the leaders. This has caused unhealthy practices and created dissident groups.The dissidents who didn’t get any space within their party formed new outfits. They also amplified negative narratives against the old parties. It happened with the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre. Had there been an exit system in the party, the situation wouldn’t be this bad. But new political parties can’t sustain without their own political ideology and orientation. You may form an organisation, cash in on people’s frustration and achieve some immediate gains, but outfits can’t sustain.But recent electoral trends show that Nepalis are seeking alternative forces and new faces. Can we be oblivious to that?You are right. We have seen such trends in the Panchayat system as well. But garnering votes during elections for one term and establishing a sustainable political force are two different things.  \nHosts Nepal made a flying start to their SAFF U-20 Championship campaign as they defeated Sri Lanka 1-0 in the opening game at the ANFA Complex in Satdobato, Kathmandu on Sunday.Nirajan Dhami scored the sole goal in the first half, sealing Nepal all three points.The victory puts Nepal in a strong position to reach their fifth semi-final of the biennial competition.The top two teams from each group advance into the last four. The Gorkhalis play Bangladesh next, on Thursday.Nepal are one of the tournament favourites alongside the winners of the last three editions, India, who start their defence of the title against Bhutan in Group B opener on Monday.Nepal started brightly and thought they had taken the lead after just one minute when Dhami diverted a freekick from Abinash Syangtan into the net with a diving header but the goal was disallowed for an offside.Dhami continued to become a threat to Sri Lanka and found the breakthrough in the 24th minute with a dazzling finish after good work from Samir Tamang, who skillfully placed the ball into the area for Dhami with an overhead kick.Dhami’s goal had arrived after a string of attacks that saw Tamang’s volley hitting the upright in the 12th minute and Nirjan Karki testing the Sri Lanka goalkeeper Ahamed Shareef in the 19th minute.Sri Lanka were helpless most of the time and never really troubled Nepal goalie Jiyarath Shekh, with their only attempt coming in the 35th minute when Johnjimron Harish’s cross almost managed to slip past Nepal goalkeeper.Nepal were more comfortable after the break but wasteful on several occasions.However, it was Sri Lanka who should have capitalised on a loose pass from Syangtan allowed captain Muhammedhu Munsif to charge into the Nepal area but the Gorkhalis soon outnumbered him.Tamang should have doubled Nepal’s lead in the 63rd minute after Ram Thapa’s cutback found him unmarked just outside the six yard box but Tamang flashed the ball over the crossbar.Nepal also had another clear opportunity in the 76th in a carbon copy of the previous opportunity, this time Syangtan passing the ball backwards for Ashwin Ghorasainee but the defender too ended up shooting over the post.Bhomjan reached the goal in the 80th after Syangtan put him through but Sri Lanka goalkeeper Shareef reacted quickly to foil the opportunity.Dhami made the last effort of the match with a brilliant volley but the crossbar again came between him and the goal.…..SAFF U-20 ChampionshipNepal1-0Sri LankaNirajan Dhami 24’Playing MondayIndia15:00BhutanEnglish Premier LeagueResultsMan United1-0FulhamIpswich Town0-2LiverpoolArsenal2-0WolvesEverton0-3BrightonNewcastle1-0SouthamptonNottm Forest1-1BournemouthWest Ham1-2Aston VillaLa LigaResultsAthletic1-1GetafeReal Betis1-1GironaGelta Vigo2-1AlavesLas Palmas2-2SevillaOsasuna1-1LeganesValencia1-2BarcelonaSerie AGenoa2-2Inter MilanParma1-1FiorentinaAC Milan2-2TorinaEmpoli0-0Monza \nForeign Minister Arzu Rana, who is in New Delhi on a five-day India visit, is meeting Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and her Indian counterpart, S Jaishankar, on Monday.Rana is scheduled to pay a courtesy call on Modi on Monday, said the Embassy of Nepal in New Delhi in a statement late on Sunday. She will also hold a bilateral meeting with Jaishankar.Rana is expected to hand over Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s invitation to the Indian prime minister to visit Nepal, according to officials privy to the development.Rana on Sunday embarked on her trip at Jaishankar’s invitation. This is her first foreign visit after being appointed the foreign minister a month ago.During her stay in the Indian capital, she will also meet senior Bharatiya Janata Party leaders, among others.Rana and Jaishankar are expected to dwell on issues earlier discussed at the seventh joint commission meeting that took place in Kathmandu earlier this year, according to the officials.The joint commission meeting had reviewed all aspects of bilateral relations and areas of cooperation including connectivity, infrastructure development, economic partnership, trade, transit, investment, power, water resources, culture, tourism, sports, health and education.Jaishankar had arrived in Kathmandu leading the Indian delegation to the highest bilateral mechanism between Nepal and India entrusted with reviewing the whole spectrum of bilateral ties.Rana’s India visit comes a week after new Indian foreign secretary Vikram Misri concluded a two-day familiarisation visit of Nepal.Rana’s visit is expected to focus on discussing matters of mutual interest rather than signing understandings or agreements, a joint-secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the Post.In her meeting with Misri in Kathmandu, Rana called for additional air routes to Nepal to increase connectivity with India; setting up a sophisticated laboratory at the Nepal-India border to test the quality of vegetables and fruits imported from India for pesticides; and expediting the negotiations for the finalisation of the detailed project report of the Pancheshwar Multipurpose Project that has been in limbo for decades, among other things.They also discussed issues such as discharging water from the Tanakpur canal to the Nepal side, river training of the Banganga, Khado, and Rapti with India’s assistance, and the inauguration of the suspension bridge in Darchula on Nepal-India border, according to the foreign ministry. \nChhabilal Dahal aka Pushpa Kamal aka Bishwas aka Prachanda has been a champion of change all his life—starting with his own name(s) to the political system. He loathes historical continuities and strives for ruptures—agragami chhalang, as he so enthusiastically pronounced in his initial days in parliamentary politics post the 2006 political changes. In fact, he chased change even as a young political leader of the Nepal Communist Party (Mashal), having changed several parties and factions before finally replacing his seniors and mentors to lead the party in 1989. But after three-and-a-half decades of being the party chief, he has no fascination for change—at least when it comes to leadership change in his party.As the CPN (Maoist-Centre)—as the party is now called after several name changes over the past decade-and-a-half, struggles to stay relevant in the aftermath of its ouster from the coalition with the CPN-UML, the question of leadership change has become prominent once again. In earlier times, anyone who talked of change in the party's leadership, strategies or ideological standpoints would be forced to leave the party altogether—Mohan Baidya, Baburam Bhattarai and Netra Bikram Chand are in case. Dahal continued to maintain his tight grip over the party even if that meant things falling apart in the party. Prachanda, the fierce one, needed to show he was the boss.This time around, Janardan Sharma is leading the band of those questioning Dahal's relevance as party chair or calling on him to hand over party leadership to younger leaders. As expected, Dahal's hardline supporters are worried that any discussion about changing leadership now, when the party is at its weakest since its resurgence in parliamentary politics in the mid-2000s, damages the party further. But Dahal's interlocutor himself has claimed that his calls for leadership change are aimed at ensuring that Dahal’s \"revolutionary\" contributions to Nepali politics last long. For Dahal to leave a lasting legacy as a changemaker, Sharma argues, he should step aside and make way for the new generation leaders within the party.Sharma isn't wrong in this regard. After all, how long can a party remain relevant under a single leader? Indeed, there must be a saturation point somewhere, and the Maoist Party seems to have gone past that point. From its heyday as the single-largest party, with 220 seats in the 601-strong first Constituent Assembly to a distant third with just 23 seats in the 275-strong Parliament, the Maoist Centre has been on a downward spiral for quite long now. And with coalition change for making and breaking governments seemingly being the only definition of change for the party now, there are obvious misgivings about Dahal's leadership. Moreover, with the recent breakthrough in the Transitional Justice Act, there are new hopes for a fairly acceptable, if not entirely successful, culmination of the peace process. A post-peace Nepal would certainly seek a new dispensation across political parties. Perhaps it is time for the Maoist Centre to realise that Dahal's alternative as party chair will be found only when it starts looking for one. \nIn the early hours of July 12, a massive debris flow in what was normally considered a small gully—locally called Sindure Kholsi at Simaltal on the Muglin-Narayanghat road—swept two night buses carrying a total of 62 passengers into the Trishuli River, a major tributary of Gandaki River. Although the rescue operation began immediately, two weeks of searching yielded only 24 bodies, while 35 others and the buses they were travelling in are still missing. Three of the passengers managed to swim to safety. The government task force formed to investigate the accident submitted its report on August 6 with meticulous recommendations to avoid such mishaps on the highways in future. Meanwhile, 38 other such fatal incidents occurred by mid-July in different parts of the country, killing 76 people in their homes when debris flow buried or damaged their houses. One may ask, shouldn’t the high rate of recurrence of mudslides, debris flow and landslides prompt further investigations to understand what triggers these events so that appropriate strategies can be formulated to reduce risks in remote villages? Heavy rains and debris flowsThe Simaltal misfortune raises questions about the intensity and duration of the rainfall that night in the Sindure Kholsi watershed; according to the investigation report, some eyewitnesses observed heavy rain. Apart from the newly built rural roads, what condition was the watershed’s land in to generate such high amounts of debris? Despite the debris flow possibly lasting for quite some time, we don't have a ballpark estimate of how much. Answers to these questions are crucial for those in other parts of the country grappling with similar problems. After all, debris or mudflows (commonly called landslides) have been one of the biggest and most recurrent threats to lives and property. It mostly occurs in and around mid-hill settlements where natural and human actions constantly alter drainage channels. The latest Solukhumbu flood, which caught global attention, reminds us that we also have infrequent yet devastating floods in higher elevations attributed to glacier lake outburst floods (GLOFs)—a different story altogether, including its trigger factor. A cursory look at landslides across the country in 2020 shows how killer landslides have started to defy our general understanding of them. In Marang, Myagdi, the debris deposited in existing gullies during the rural road construction—similar to the one we witnessed in Simaltal this year—flowed down, causing devastation. The landslides in Barekot, Jajarkot, originated from farmlands with no road. At the same time, houses in Lidi, Sindhupalchok, were buried by debris brought down by the failure of an abandoned terrace way above the village. In Parbat and Tanahun, massive debris flow originated from some very well-guarded forest areas above the villages that killed people and damaged houses and farms. In Baglung, a combination of landslides and a series of landslide-blocked-lake-outburst floods swept away 76 houses. While comparing these places is difficult due to varied geographical conditions, one common element across all of these cases is that they were all triggered by high-intensity localised rain, a trend on the rise due to the local impacts of a changing climate yet poorly understood. In 2021, some studies covered heavy localised rain, which deposited massive amounts of debris on the bed of the Melamchi River, rendering the intake of the Melamchi Water Supply Project impotent. Simaltal indicated a similar event on a smaller scale. Numerous incidents of such heavy localised rain across the country haven’t attracted media attention despite causing substantial and widespread damage. The investigation in Simaltal was an opportunity to dig deeper to examine the issues related to heavy localised rain, which would have provided crucial data to understand the changing nature of rainfall.Taming the monsoon runoffBoth the monsoon disasters and water scarcity in the winter, which are worsening, are two sides of the same coin. Increasing localised rain not only leads to further disaster risks but also intense water scarcity in winter since the rainwater that is supposed to seep into aquifers won’t have enough time to do so. The government’s rescue-centric preparedness approach has been instrumental in reducing the human toll—a commendable feat, indeed—but it’s far from effectively preventing such incidents, much less augmenting groundwater in the long run. Addressing water-induced disasters thus should take a two-pronged approach: Reduce the risks caused by heavy rain during the monsoon and find ways to augment depleting groundwater sources to ensure water security in winter. The right time to do both is during the monsoon through the management of monsoon runoff. Except for those located on the ridge area, every village—or even farm—has its watershed from where rainwater flows down through small channels in the form of runoff. When altered, these channels get widened, deepened, or blocked by both natural and human actions and become a cause for debris flow during heavy rain. A doable solution to reduce the risk of debris flow would be to thus tame the runoff by keeping it spread over a wider area, allowing it to accumulate in ponds or converge only in stable channels that have conveyed large volumes of runoff in the past. Revisiting past effortsIn the 1990s, some efforts were made to reinforce what people in the mountain villages traditionally did to tame the runoff and stabilise active gullies and landslides threatening farms and houses in villages in the hills of Lalitpur. It primarily involved three key actions: Appraising the landscape in and around the villages to understand the unique water problems at different elevations due to their geographical context. Then, mapping drainage channels in the watershed to look for places to divert runoff and store them temporarily in multiple dugout ponds. It would cut debris flow risks as well as augment depleting groundwater—a common concern in the hills, which is growing in recent years manifested in the drying springs and rivulets. After that, points of runoff accumulation, along with changes in the size and direction of runoff channels, would be monitored. The results were remarkable. Active landslides and gullies stabilised and became greener—a sign of increased soil moisture—without additional investment. It’s time that lessons from these experiences be reexamined and replicated in at least those places that have begun receiving heavy localised rain to reduce the risk of debris flow and/or villages where springs and rivulets are drying up or have dried altogether.  \nI was invited to a literary programme organised by Srasta Samaj and Bhairav Puraskar Guthi on August 19, 2024, in Kathmandu. A note was appended to the invitation—Rochak Ghimire would turn 84 on that day and would be felicitated by a large group of writers and readers. Being very familiar with the literary contribution of Ghimire, this news unfolded a history of the literary times to me. Ghimire has made history as a publisher of the literary magazine Rachana, which started in 1961 when Nepal was on the cusp of an era that introduced several political and ideological challenges. The conspicuous response to the sensitivity of the times came from literary magazines. Roop-Rekha, a prominent literary magazine, came following hard on the heels of Panchayat, an autocratic system of government introduced by King Mahendra after dissolving people's elected parliament and jailing Prime Minister BP Koirala in 1960. I have drawn more examples of how literary magazines responded to such systems later in the article. Ghimire made a humble start, which was the best way to remain outside the influence of the nascent political system called Panchayat. He spent Rs500 to publish 300 copies at that time. I remember writing a long survey and analysis of the 100 issues of Rachana, which was published in the magazine in 2008. Remarkably, the literary magazine continues to this date and brings together cohorts of people who write literature and those who come to listen to literary discourses in literary programmes. Ghimire has been doing that through Rachana.Literary magazines were published at different times of the long autocratic Rana rule (1846-1950) in Nepal. They were the best means of creating a forum of expression, which would be creative and metaphorical. A careful study of Nepali literature written over the times shows that some of the most creative minds of this land had chosen literary writing as the medium of their expression. But it was challenging during the Rana regime. The writers, therefore, chose some easy ways. One was publishing literary magazines from Banaras, but they would not publish articles that would directly earn the wrath of the Rana rulers. Banaras had become the hub of publication for the Nepali writers who were either studying there or doing some small publication works. They would publish books on religious, social, folk and astrological themes and sell them within Nepal. Scholars have analysed this theme under the rubric 'print capitalism' by using a term introduced by Italian professor Francesca Orsini. I have no space to discuss the theme here.That activity was quite prolific in Banaras from the last years of the 19th century and the first or second decades of the 20th century. Editors and writers published their works and 'marketised' them among the Nepali language readers in Nepal and India. A small but quite diverse reading public came into existence. The literary magazines published by the youths there set a tradition of publication. They created forums to express their feelings and ideas couched in the language of religion or social or ethical writings. Literary magazines like Upanyas Tarangini (1902), Sundari (1906) and Madhavi (1914) were published from Banaras. But another centre, a hill area of Darjeeling, followed that tradition. The publication of Paras Mani Pradhan's Chandrika (1918) is one example. The magazines published in the 30s of the 20th century from Banaras and Kathmandu had a strong connection. They wanted to create a reading public whose sphere was small but important. The role played by 'print capitalism' was remarkable. In that context, the publication of Nepali Sahitya Sammelan Patrika (1931) from Darjeeling, Sharada (1934) from Kathmandu and Udaya (1936) from Banaras should be mentioned here.The publication of Sharada from Kathmandu is a vital event in Nepal's literary times. A cohort of writers decided to establish a forum to publish their views and inner feelings through symbols, metaphors and stories. The path was arduous, as they had to convince the Rana Prime Minister Juddha Shumsher, who was not happy about such a publication. But he saw some energy working there and allowed the writers to proceed with the work. He didn’t want them to cross a certain limit, though.Nepali literary critic Yadunath Khanal interpreted that juncture of time as a moment of tacit agreement between the writers and PM Juddha Shumsher. In one editorial of Sharada compiled in Sharadaka Sampadakiya Bicharharu (2001) by Shiva Regmi, we can read an important story. The editorial was obviously written by Riddhibahadur Malla.When a group of writers got an appointment to meet Juddha, he was sitting with a British envoy named Col CT Dox. An interpreter communicated the ideas of the British official to the writers. Dox's opinion was that since there was already a government newspaper named Gorkhapatra, there was no need to ask for another magazine. The envoy had also said to Juddha earlier, \"Now we are facing problems in Hindustan for allowing other papers to publish.\" Juddha asked the writers to heed the suggestion of the British envoy and not be enthusiastic about publishing Sharada. But as Yadunath Khanal said, Juddha allowed the writers to publish a literary magazine named Sharada in the winter of 1934. That was a tacit agreement between the rulers and the writers. However, the reference to the British anxiety regarding freedom to publish newspapers and magazines is notable. That also shows how the literary writers kept up the spirit of freedom and creative thinking through such tacit agreements. It was possible only through literary expressions. Literary magazines also came into existence after the political turn of the 1950s and of the 1960s. The continuity of the literary magazines run by individual literary persons like Uttam Kunwar and Balmukunda Pandey's Roop-Rekha, Rochak Ghimire's Rachana, Nagendra Sharma's Abhivyakti, Achyutraman Adhikari's Unnayan and a few others are unforgettable milestones of Nepali literary journeys. A survey of similar icons of the literary times of other languages of Nepal would make the picture complete. Literary magazines have traversed the difficult but important terrains of awakenings in this land.  \nRecently, a 34-year-old male with a two-day history of fever, nausea, weakness and body aches was admitted to the emergency department of Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital in Kathmandu. His oxygen saturation (SpO2) was 95 percent on room air, and he tested positive for Covid-19. Covid-like illness is rising in the community, especially since the beginning of the monsoon season. It indicates that the disease itself might be circulating in Nepal. In fact, as per the World Health Organization (WHO) data, Nepal has observed a drastic increase in the SARS-CoV-2 virus, from 5.56 percent (week 28) to 13.68 percent (week 31) in a three week-interval (i.e., between July 8-14 and July 29-August 4). The variant responsible for the rapid increase of Covid infection rate in the community is unknown. Hence, it has been termed “monsoon covid” here.By the end of May 2024, Nepal had confirmed several Omicron sub-variants, including KP.1, KP.2, KP.3 and KP.4, also known as KP or “FLiRT” subvariants. Dozens of patients diagnosed with Covid-19 have been admitted to Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital since the beginning of March 2024. Most of the patients were aged 65 and above and required the intensive care unit. Until now, there is no evidence of an increase in hospitalisations due to monsoon covid. Nonetheless, it cannot be definitively ruled out that it may become severe in the upcoming days in Nepal. In the past, Nepal has typically experienced waves of Covid-19 following outbreaks in neighbouring India due to their shared border. Thus, we usually predict that when a Covid-19 outbreak occurs in India, Nepal will inevitably see a wave of Covid-19 after a couple of weeks or months. Nevertheless, this time, Nepal is observing monsoon covid before India, and it currently has the highest SARS-CoV-2 infection rate in the Southeast-Asian region. As per the WHO data, India has maintained a constant rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection over the past four weeks (between week-28 and week-31), and in fact, even decreasing trend to 0.73 percent (i.e., July 29- August 4) from 3.26 percent (week-28, i.e., July 8-14). It is uncertain whether the monsoon covid will hit India in the coming days, but it is not impossible. Fever, cough and shortness of breath are the main symptoms of Covid-19. However, the symptoms have varied over multiple waves with people exhibiting atypical symptoms like silent or happy hypoxia, loss of taste and smell and flu-like illness. Notably, the patient who visited STIDH did not have a cough and shortness of breath but exhibited a low platelet count, which is unusual in patients with Covid-19. Such a changing pattern of clinical symptoms of Covid-19 over the period is not surprising. The absence of cough, shortness of breath and the presence of thrombocytopenia (a low platelet count, i.e., 70,000 per microliter of blood) is a rare phenomenon and thus worthwhile to study further. More cases, however, are needed to fully comprehend the monsoon covid and its evolving symptoms. Viruses evolve over time, and become more or less severe. We can, therefore, expect Covid-19 to continue to evolve with more genetic mutations in the coming days. Unfortunately, are unaware of the increasing trends of monsoon covid in Nepal and its reasons. It is wise to identify mutations or analyse genetic sequencing to understand the resurgence of monsoon covid.As of now, the seasonality of Covid-19 is not well established in Nepal. However, there have always been peaks (small or big) of Covid-19 cases during or around August in the past. Based on past data, we can assume that Covid-19 can reappear during the monsoon season every year in Nepal. Then, the question arises: Can we consider Covid-19 a seasonal virus like the influenza virus in Nepal? It is unknown whether monsoon covid will cause an increase in hospitalisations in the coming days, as seen in March 2024, owing to KP or “FLiRT” subvariants. However, such a scenario should not be underestimated. Although vaccines against the virus are available, people are not interested in getting jabbed. Preventive measures also help to avoid it, but vaccines are still important. Continuous surveillance, genetic analysis and vaccination should be prioritised. \nThe Philippines has detected a new case of the mpox virus in the country, the first since December last year, its health department said on Monday, adding it was awaiting test results before being able to determine the strain.The patient was a 33-year-old Filipino male who had no travel history outside the Philippines, the Department of Health (DOH) said.“We are awaiting sequencing results and will update once available,” its spokesperson Albert Domingo said when asked about the strain.The World Health Organization on Wednesday declared mpox a global public health emergency, its highest form of alert, following an outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo that had spread to neighbouring countries.A new form of the virus has triggered global concern as it seems to spread easily through routine close contact.A case of the new variant was confirmed on Thursday in Sweden and linked to a growing outbreak in Africa, the first sign of its spread outside the continent. Pakistan on Friday confirmed at least one case of the mpox virus in a patient who had returned from a Gulf country, but said they did not yet know the strain of the virus.The new case in the Philippines is the 10th laboratory-confirmed case the health department has detected. Its first case was in July 2022.“Symptoms started more than a week ago with fever, which was followed four days later by findings of a distinct rash on the face, back, nape, trunk, groin, as well as palms and soles,” the Philippine DOH said in a statement.The disease, caused by the monkeypox virus, leads to flu-like symptoms and pus-filled lesions. It is usually mild but can kill, children, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV, all at higher risk of complications. \nUS Vice President Kamala Harris indirectly criticized former President Donald Trump on Sunday, suggesting her opponent in the November 5 election was a “coward” whose politics focused on putting down rivals.The remarks came in a campaign appearance in the critical battleground state of Pennsylvania with running mate Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, before Harris heads to the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, which kicks off Monday.“Over the last several years there’s been this kind of perversion that has taken place, I think, which is to suggest that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down. When what we know is the real and true measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up,” Harris told a crowd of supporters. “Anybody who’s about beating down other people is a coward.”She did not directly name Trump, who in a campaign appearance Saturday in eastern Pennsylvania referred to Harris as a “radical” and a “lunatic.”“There will be a lot that is about what I believe is a way forward, a new way forward, and bringing everyone along in that,” she told reporters outside a restaurant.Trump on Saturday said he believed she would be easier to beat than Biden, 81, who dropped out last month under pressure from his own party after a disastrous debate against Trump.Pennsylvania was one of three Rust Belt states, along with Wisconsin and Michigan, that helped power Republican Trump's upset victory in the 2016 election.Biden, who grew up in Scranton, Pennsylvania, flipped the trio back to the Democrats in 2020, and Harris aims to hold on to them.Sources said on Saturday that she is likely to join Biden on stage at the convention on Monday as he passes the torch to her as the party’s nominee for president.The Trump campaign will try to counter-program the convention with a series of swing-state events this week. He will visit a manufacturing facility in York, Pennsylvania, on Monday, where his campaign says he will focus on the economy, and a county sheriff's office in Howell, Michigan, on Tuesday to talk about safety and crime.Trump and his running mate, Senator JD Vance, will travel to Asheboro, North Carolina, on Wednesday for remarks on national security, and on Friday Trump will join Turning Point Action, a group founded by conservative activist Charlie Kirk, for a rally in Glendale, Arizona, aimed in part at highlighting efforts to boost turnout.Trump supporters said they hope he will refocus his campaign on policy rather than the repeated personal attacks against Harris he has leaned heavily on in the weeks since she emerged as the Democratic candidate.“President Trump can win this election. His policies are good for America and if you have a policy debate he wins. Donald Trump the provocateur, the showman, may not win this election,” Republican US Senator Lindsey Graham said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday. “Policy is the key to the White House.” \nOn Monday the weather is forecast to be generally cloudy throughout the country.Light to moderate rainfall with thunder and lightning at many places in Koshi, Bagmati, Gandaki, Lumbini, Karnali and Sudurpaschim provinces as well as a few places in Madhesh Province. There are chances of heavy rainfall in one or two places in all the provinces.Tonight the weather is forecast to be partly to generally cloudy throughout the country. There is a possibility of light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning at many places of Koshi, Bagmati, Gandaki, Lumbini, Karnali and Sudur Pashchim Province and some places of Madesh Province.The meteorological forecasting division has forecast chances of heavy rainfall at one or two places in the country.On Sunday Janakpur experienced the hottest temperature of 37.8 Degrees Celsius while Jomsom experienced the lowest temperature of 15.5 Degrees Celsius. \nMinister for Foreign Affairs Arzu Rana Deuba left for New Delhi on Sunday on a five-day India visit at the invitation of her Indian counterpart S Jaishankar.She left for the Indian Capital City at 11:30pm. Minister Rana was seen off at the Tribhuvan International Airport by Foreign Secretary Sewa Lamsal, among other senior foreign ministry officials.It is her first official trip after taking office on July 15. She is accompanied by Joint Secretary Bhrigu Dhungana, division chief of the South Asia Division at the foreign ministry, among others.During the visit, the foreign minister will hold a meeting with Jaishankar and discuss matters of mutual interest for further strengthening Nepal-India relations and promoting cooperation, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.The foreign minister’s visit comes a week after new Indian foreign secretary Vikram Misri concluded a two-day familiarisation visit to Nepal.She will also meet senior Bharatiya Janata Party leaders.Foreign Minister Rana will return home on Thursday. \nThe parliamentary special committee formed to investigate irregularities and misappropriation of cooperative funds on Sunday recorded the statement of Bipin Acharya, joint general secretary of the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP).Acharya, who was once the creative director at Gorkha Media Network, was interrogated at the committee’s secretariat in Singha Durbar.Acharya, along with RSP chairman Rabi Lamichhane, is alleged to have been involved in the misappropriation of funds from the cooperatives established under Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai.Documents revealed that a total of Rs25.6 million was provided to Gorkha Media, including Rs10 million from Suryadarshan Saving and Credit Cooperatives on 13 December 2021 and Rs15.5 million from Supreme Cooperatives on 27 December 2021. Acharya not only transferred the funds to Gorkha Media but also directed them to his own company via Gorkha Media.Gorkha Media reportedly transferred Rs53.5 million to Nobody Production Pvt Ltd, a company founded by Acharya’s wife, Surakshya Adhikari.‘Saregama Little Champs’, which aired 37 episodes on Galaxy TV, was funded by Supreme Cooperatives through payments to Nobody Production. \nCome autumn, Nepal will deploy heavy lifter drones to transport garbage from the 6,812-metre tall Ama Dablam, south of Everest. This will be the first commercial work an unmanned aerial vehicle does in Nepal’s high-altitude zone.The heavy lifter from China’s biggest drone maker, Da Jiang Innovations (DJI), will take on tasks traditionally handled by Sherpas. Officials believe it will help reduce casualties on Everest.Then, in spring (March-May), DJI drones, which make sounds similar to a swarm of bees, will be put to work on Everest.It will fly to Camp I (5,943 metres) to supply ropes and ladders to prepare routes and bring garbage to the Everest base camp at 5,364 metres.On Sunday, a tripartite memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed between the Sagarmatha Pollution Control Committee, the Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Rural Municipality, and the Airlift Technology Pvt Ltd for the use of advanced drone technology to efficiently manage garbage in the mountains of the Khumbu region.In April, Chinese drone maker DJI conducted the world’s first drone delivery test on Everest.“After a successful test in April, we plan to use drones commercially in the Everest region,” said Jagat Bhusal, chief administration officer of the rural municipality that hosts Everest. The test result showed that the DJI FlyCart 30, the long-distance heavy lifter drone, could airlift 234 kg per hour between Camp I and Base Camp, a task usually accomplished by at least 14 porters in six hours. Drone manufacturer DJI is under the microscope as US lawmakers push for a ban on Chinese drones, amid deteriorating relations between the US and China, the world’s largest trading nations.Nepali officials and mountaineers, however, see the drone as a life-saving vehicle.Traditionally, local Sherpa guides are responsible for transporting supplies and clearing trash on Everest. They may need to cross the icefall over 30 times a season to transport supplies such as oxygen bottles, gas canisters, tents, food, and ropes.All climbers and guides must navigate the icefall on the route to the world’s tallest peak. The icefall is so notoriously dangerous that even experienced Sherpas hesitate to move when the sun shines.The Khumbu Icefall, a river of ice a kilometre or so long, is usually crossed at night or early morning, with climbers putting headlamps on their helmets.Normally, the route is crossed early in the morning, when the ice blocks and the hanging glaciers are stable and avalanche risks are low.During the day, as the sun warms the mountain, the hanging glaciers melt, and ice crumbles, increasing the risk of avalanche.“Using drones will help us avoid the dangers in the Khumbu Icefall,” said Bhusal. On April 18, 2014, an avalanche resulting from a falling serac buried 16 Sherpa guides in the Khumbu Icefall, eventually leading to the cancellation of the season’s expeditions.Last year, three Sherpa guides mobilised to prepare the routes were buried under the ice masses triggered by an avalanche in the Khumbu Icefall. Their bodies are yet to be recovered.The Himalayan Database and the government records show that nearly 50 individuals died on the icefall between 1953 and 2023.The climb from Everest Base Camp to Camp I takes six hours. Between these two camps lies the Khumbu Icefall, the most treacherous part of the route.The most exciting and easiest part of the route is reaching Camp II (6,400 metres), which takes four hours from Camp I.There is a set of restrictions in the mountains for carrying loads.According to government rules, workers climbing high altitudes must not carry loads exceeding 20kg between 5,000 and 6,000 metres, 17 kg between 6,001 and 7,000 metres, 14 kg between 7,001 to 8,000 metres, and 12 kg for altitudes above 8,000 metres.“Yes, there are concerns that the machines may actually cut jobs. But our sole purpose is to reduce potential deaths in the Khumbu Icefall, the danger zone,” said Bhusal.“We will train Sherpas, as drone operators cannot handle tasks at the higher camps. In the future, all work will be done by Sherpas.” In the trial phase, the drone could lift 30 kg from Camp I. However, its performance dropped to 18 kg from Camp II. “Based on the MoU framework, we will soon sign a commercial agreement with the drone supplier,” said Bhusal. “The municipality will monitor all the activities.”The municipality has, so far, spent Rs800,000 on the trial. Climate change is melting snow and ice, exposing even more garbage and bodies that have been covered for decades on Everest. This waste pollutes the natural environment and poses a severe health risk to everyone who lives in the Everest watershed.Nearly 100 tonnes of garbage were collected during this spring climbing season from Everest and Lhotse, which share the same base camp.According to the Sagarmatha Pollution Control Committee (SPCC), 77.19 tonnes of waste was collected from the Everest base camp alone during the Spring 2024 climbing season. With 8-9 tonnes coming from the higher camps brought down by the expedition agencies, the SPCC collected 85 tonnes of waste this spring.The breakdown of collected waste shows burnable garbage at 27.99 tonnes, recyclable garbage at 7.51 tonnes, human waste at 27.53 tonnes, and kitchen waste at 14.15 tonnes. The Nepal Army also collected over 11 tonnes of garbage. In Spring 2023, the SPCC managed nearly 70 tonnes of waste from expedition groups.Insiders say the Everest Base Camp has become more luxurious, leading to an accumulation of people and garbage. Nearly 60,000 people trek to the Base Camp annually.Since 2015, the SPCC has enforced the 8 kg garbage rule, requiring every climber ascending the Everest base camp to return with at least 8 kg of garbage. Visitors to Everest must also pay a $4,000 garbage deposit, which is refunded if the person returns with 8 kg.Before this year’s climbing season, the Supreme Court issued a mandamus order directing the government to regulate the rising number of expeditions on the world’s tallest mountain.The court order followed frequent traffic jams and increasing trash on Everest, which has even been called the ‘world's highest garbage dump’.“Drones can replace helicopters as a relatively low-risk transport vehicle to supplement supplies on the plateau, which will greatly expand the application space of UAVs,” Cai Yong, a senior engineer at East China Normal University, told Xinhua, the state news agency of China, after the April test.In recent years, more electric drones have been used in agriculture and forestry, power line inspection, logistics, and emergency rescue, and each breakthrough will help save human and material resources and protect the safety of life and property, Jin Wei, deputy secretary-general of the China UAV Industry Innovation Alliance, told Xinhua.The April tests used the DJI FlyCart 30 to fly three bottles of oxygen and 1.5 kg of other supplies from the base camp to Camp I of the world's highest peak and to carry garbage down on the return trip.During the tests, the DJI FlyCart 30 flew up to 6,191.8 metres on Everest, which straddles the Nepal-China border.  \nIn Nepali Congress, the position of general secretary is considered the second most powerful after the party president.Historically, some charismatic leaders have held the position in the country’s grand old party: from Krishna Prasad Bhattarai in the 1950s, to Mahendra Narayan Nidhi, Girija Prasad Koirala, to now the duo of Gagan Thapa and Bishwa Prakash Sharma.When two relatively younger and popular leaders—Thapa and Sharma—got elected as general secretaries in December 2021, they had kindled hope among young Congress members and well-wishers of the party.But over time, they have failed to implement their agendas as the establishment led by party chief Deuba is dominant. Political analysts and observers, too, say that Thapa and Sharma have failed to reflect the strength of their popular mandate in the party decision making process.Prior to its 14th general convention, the party had the provision of one elected general secretary whereas the other was nominated by the party President after the general convention. In the last convention, the party amended its statute and made it mandatory to elect both the general secretaries and other party bearers through voting.With Thapa and Sharma elected as the Congress general secretaries, they were expected to challenge the septuagenarian party President Sher Bahadur Deuba.However, as a party insider claims, the general secretary duo themselves are struggling to create their space in party leadership. This struggle is a testament to the challenges they face in cementing their influence in the Congress, says a party leader.“The party’s general secretary is usually occupied with official work,” Prakash Sharan Mahat, a Congress spokesperson, told the Post. “How active they are in the party’s internal affairs is not something I can comment on.”After being elected as the party’s general secretaries, Thapa and Sharma have publicly spoken about being kept in the dark on vital matters. For instance, while speaking at the 42nd BP Memorial programme held on July 20, Thapa said the July 1 agreement between Congress and CPN-UML reached to form a new coalition government came as a surprise.Purushottam Dahal, a senior journalist close to the Congress, says the two general secretaries didn’t understand their exact role.“The general secretary’s role is to make the party’s central secretariat functional, but they are trying to be reactionary, which is inappropriate,” Dahal told the Post. “To make the party functional, they should not wait for a green signal from the party president.”However, General Secretary Sharma rubbishes such a claim.“There have been some transformative changes in the party after we assumed the role of general secretaries,” Sharma told the Post. “From establishing a library in the party’s central office to holding the BP Koirala Literature Festival, we have made the party more vibrant.”He argued that what has happened is that the duo have failed to publicise some of their important works.The general secretaries claim they are facing difficulties because of the party leadership’s working style, but some leaders don’t buy that argument.Sharma further claims that their work is often hindered by the generational gap with Deuba.“In addition, both of us general secretaries were elected from different panels during the general convention, which caused some misunderstanding among party leaders,” Sharma said.But there are other Congress leaders who accuse the general secretaries of suddenly turning risk-averse. “They are bound by the party statute as the party follows a presidential system where the president prevails over others,” Govinda Pokharel, a newly appointed head of the Economic Policy and Planning Department of the Congress, told the Post. “However, the two general secretaries cannot accommodate all groups in the party, and hence their difficulties.” According to Pokharel, after becoming the party’s office bearers, they are slowly turning cautious. “Although they have a very popular base and they also have content-based knowledge on development, they are not being able to use their potential.” Sharma differs.“We have challenged the party leadership on many issues to establish our agenda,” Sharma said. “At the party’s Mahasamiti meeting in February, we successfully proposed contesting the upcoming election with the party’s own strength… The party's central committee meeting, which will commence on Wednesday, will pass our proposal as it is.” A Congress leader close to General Secretary Thapa, however, acknowledged that Thapa is sometimes clueless about the party’s functioning.“From the beginning, the general secretaries have not been able to mobilise the leaders in their fold effectively,” Shankar Tiwari, a Congress youth leader close to Thapa, told the Post. “Sometimes they prevail over the party president, but on many other occasions they are also at his mercy.”Meanwhile, a few Congress leaders claim that the popularity of the general secretaries duo is diminishing, which could make it difficult for them to elevate themselves in party politics in the coming days. There are ample examples where Congress leaders lost their revolutionary spirit after becoming general secretary, says the leader.Only three past general secretaries of Congress have succeeded in becoming party chief and the prime minister. Krishna Prasad Bhattarai was the general secretary of the party soon after the establishment of democracy in Nepal in 1950. Likewise, Girija Prasad Koirala, another general secretary during the 1990s, later became the prime minister as well as the party President. Sushil Koirala was the third general secretary to become party president, and the prime minister. Jagat Nepal, a long-time Congress observer, says that apart from the prime minister, two of the Congress’s general secretaries have become the country’s President, if not party president and prime minister. “Ram Baran Yadav, the first President of the country, and Ramchandra Paudel, the current President, both were once the party’s general secretary,” Nepal told the Post. Besides, Taranath Ranabhat, the former general secretary of the party, and Paudel became Speakers of the House of Representatives in the 1990s.Nepal added that despite not being elevated to the party’s top position, a few former general secretaries of Congress had played an important role in national politics. “We can’t draw a sweeping conclusion that leaders lose their influence after becoming general secretary,” he said.Apart from the leaders mentioned above, Mahendra Narayan Nidhi, Krishna Prasad Sitaula, Prakash Man Singh, Sashank Koirala, and Purna Bahadur Khadka were the few among others who took up the responsibility of the general secretary.“As far as why they were not able to lift themselves to the top position is concerned, sometimes, despite their personal efficiency, circumstances might not be favourable,” Dahal, the senior journalist, said.General Secretary Sharma echoes Dahal.In the past, the party president used to nominate one of the two general secretaries. In such a case, the nominated general secretary would obviously not be able to challenge the party chief, Sharma said. From the 14th general convention, the party started to elect both general secretaries through voting by party delegates. \nAjaya Dixit’s current work focuses on studying challenges of building resilience across boundaries and at sub-national scales. He has studied and written extensively on water resources, trans-boundary water cooperation, flood management, wash services and climate change adaptation, clean energy transition and related policy studies. In this interview with the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal, Dixit discusses river management in Nepal’s urban areas: Where have we gone wrong in this endeavour and what can we do? You have extensively studied river systems and have been following changes seen in river basins. How do you see recent problems caused by encroachment and rampant development activities?We humans have lived and have to continue to live within water cycles: water evaporates from the ocean to the sky and then precipitates to the land and flows via rivers back to the ocean. Rivers that function as arteries of the land surface, sustaining humans, aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems face widespread abuses: pollution, rampant extraction of their bed and banks, fragmentation and degradation. Without rivers, we would not be who we are. Unfortunately, we have forgotten this essence. We neglect and abuse rivers. In 1981, just after the monsoon ended, I, along with my students, walked from Sundarijal to Teku studying Bagmati rivers’ sediment. At many places, we walked on the riverbed. The river then was clean. Gradually, the river systems began to face all-round decay. I have read painful accounts of my contemporaries who remember swimming in the clean Bagmati and its tributaries. In less than 50 years, our rivers in Kathmandu Valley and other basins no longer look like rivers. I feel helpless and ache with pain at this collective failure! What state of rivers are we passing on to our next generation?River encroachment is common across Nepal but more serious in urban areas, including in Kathmandu. How can this be stopped?Our approach to rivers is an imitation of the trend common across South Asia, or the subcontinent, which is again largely based on the knowledge system developed in the industrialised Global North without contextualising locally. The region features waterscapes of high and punctuated rainfall during the monsoon months, rivers, wetlands, ponds, and springs, all connected with groundwater aquifers in one of the most complex landscapes of the world: the Himalaya-Ganga region. Yet, current development endeavours subjugate water rather than respect and live with it. In 2022, the Indus River in Pakistan faced major floods with devastating consequences. Referring to these floods, a group of global scientists stated that “the impacts [of the floods] were the outcome of an outdated river management system.” This approach is primarily based on building of physical structures such as buildings, bridges and roads close to rivers interfering with their natural flows. The approach that began in the early twentieth century keeps marching on even while we are facing twenty first century water challenges.There is an increasing trend of building corridor roads along the rivers in Kathmandu as well as other places. Is this a good or bad practice? In Nepal, road building in the hills has earned the sobriquet of “dozer roads,” meaning politically designed roads excavated by heavy machine operators without adhering to basic engineering, social, environmental, or hydrological safeguards. Even highways built with “engineering,” such as the Mugling-Narayanghat section, face regular accidents. The sliding of the two buses in the Trishuli is the recent example. Building roads along the banks of rivers, defined as “river corridors,” is the preferred approach for improving connectivity. In the Kathmandu Valley, this is also associated with rivers shackled within concrete walls in the name of river beautification. In the monsoon, however, they all overflow as we have been seeing in the last few years and this year as well.What will happen to these rivers 10-15 years down the line? Is there any chance of some of our rivers dying? Or, will the measures taken in recent times protect them?All rivers must flow clean and free in selected stretches. But today, rivers are disconnected with their floodplains. Within walls and embankments, they have become conduits of filth. Many rivers are already seriously degraded. If the current trend continues, many rivers may die. I remember Jacques-Yves Cousteau, the French oceanographer, filmmaker, and author, who wrote: “Water and air, the two essential fluids on which all life depends, have become global garbage cans.” Our current efforts at conserving, developing and managing rivers are grossly inadequate. During the Covid-19 pandemic, we saw some rivers heal as human actions across the board ceased due to the lockdown. But this healing came at huge human and economic costs. The lessons, however, are clear. We must stop turning rivers into garbage cans for them to begin to heal. The onus lies on us, our activities, our governance, and the policies we make and put into practice effectively. We need new ways of imagining rivers in harmony with human needs. Otherwise, the rivers will die. If rivers die, what will become of us?What problems may city dwellers face as a result of this continued destruction of rivers?A 2020 analysis of rivers in Nepal found that the quality of rivers in the mid-hills and the Tarai are already deteriorating. Industries, cities, towns, and agriculture produce waste that, when disposed of in rivers untreated, cause pollution. Solid and liquid wastes produced by expanding cities and towns pollute nearby rivers, streams, and water bodies. Pollution kills aquatic life such as fish, which are sources of livelihood for many communities. Polluted rivers and water bodies degrade human and environmental health, leading to negative impacts on human livelihoods. The impacts of pollution on rivers are considerable during non-monsoon months when river discharge, and consequently the capacity of rivers to dilute waste, are low.What should be done to conserve the rivers, at least in the present form, and stop further damages?All rivers are a combination of water (W), energy (E), biodiversity aquatic (B), and sediment (S), represented by the acronym WEBS. In the current scheme of things, the focus is on water and energy. Aquatic ecosystems are the concern of only those working on freshwater ecosystems. They are neglected in the larger context though the state has made some provisions for conserving ecosystems. In Nepal’s Hydropower Development Policy of 2001 all hydropower plants must release 10 percent minimum flow to the downstream reaches to enable fish and other aquatic life to survive in the river. A 2021 study of 50 hydropower plants however found that none of the plants surveyed release environmental-flows. All hydropower plants, as per their power purchasing agreements, are required to produce maximum power during the dry season. We should start by accepting the fact that rivers need clean flowing water and respecting the policies we have made. Then we must systematically introduce changes and avoid the oversights embedded in the present approach. The present approach to water development and management focused on engineering and structural solutions is based on single-disciplinary education that is blind to gender and social inclusion challenges and aquatic ecosystems. In the present approach, nobody seems to want sediment which is a natural consequence of flow within the water cycle.To meet such an objective, we need to begin with a system of integrated knowledge that synthesises natural science, social science, and indigenous practices. By incorporating fields such as hydrology, ecology, social science-supported context-specific engineering, and indigenous knowledge and practices, we can take a comprehensive approach to water management challenges and solutions. Interdisciplinary approaches can build collaboration, innovation, and systemic decision-making and promote innovative water management for the benefit of both ecosystems and human societies.Do you think initiatives such as river clean up campaigns run by various groups help protect these waterways?I see such initiatives as manifestation of dissatisfaction of concerned citizens with the degradation of rivers and to bring about changes. In 1990, I was part of the Save Bagmati Campaign, which aimed to highlight the degrading state of the river. This campaign has taken many new forms, and citizen groups have begun campaigns in other rivers of Nepal. They however remain fragmented and ad-hoc. Similar campaigns in some countries have led to granting rights to rivers. In 2017, New Zealand recognised the Whanganui River and its tributaries as legal entities, acknowledging their physical and spiritual significance as “living and indivisible” and ensuring their survival, health, and integrity to balance the needs of humans and nature. Promulgations like Living Indus (Pakistan), Namami Gange river-improvement programme (India) can offer lessons for a holistic water journey. The collective voice of concerned citizens for the integrity of rivers can be a powerful medium for policy and pathway changes. Nepal must also begin country-wide river restoration initiatives. We need more dialogue and conversation around water challenges and solutions.As cities turn into concrete jungles, their water tables are said to be receding alarmingly. You often propose redesigning our settlements and development infrastructure in a way that wouldn’t disturb rivers’ natural courses and catchment areas. Could you elaborate?South Asia is a region of waterscapes containing streams, ponds, wetlands, open spaces, floodplains, springs, and underground aquifers. Yet, our towns, cities, and infrastructure are planned, designed, and built to disregard water rather than live with it. As land-centric urban growth dominates, waterscapes temporarily seem to vanish but later water comes back. In Nepali we have a saying “In twelve years a stream returns”. The present practice of urban development is obsessed with concretisation, making these areas impermeable. Rainwater, part of which would naturally infiltrate the ground, now immediately reaches the rivers already constrained by walls. The river at a downstream section immediately peaks and when the rainfall stops the river has very low discharge. Basic parameters, like the intensity of rainfall (mm per hour), are poorly recognised and used in design guidelines. The interaction of current urbanisation practices and increasing extreme rainfall, temperature and humidity rise spawned by climate change and urban heat island effects will make our urban areas as crucible of hazards, and unhealthy. A new urban future must harmoniously integrate nature, including water bodies and wetlands, and preserve natural land cover, including traditional ponds to promote groundwater recharge. It can be further achieved by preserving green open spaces, forests, gardens, permeable “sponge” pavements, and natural waterfronts for healthier communities in sustainable cities. The starting point will be recognising cities as waterscapes. Amplified mitigation of emissions of greenhouse gases at global levels remains a critical imperative in this new future. The major impacts of climate change are evident through the water cycle. Squatters settled along the riverbanks are taken as one of the major headaches in preserving rivers’ catchment areas. How can this issue be resolved?The squatters and migrants to urban regions are outcomes of the present-day political economy of development. People move to cities seeking livelihood, education, and opportunities to move up the social ladder. These groups who end up living in high-risk areas are sometimes also seen as political vote banks. This issue needs to be viewed within the larger development question including generation of local employment, new livelihood opportunities and addressing insecurities of water, food, health, and education.Recently the Supreme Court asked authorities to make septic tank and soak pit mandatory while approving building designs in order to help recharge groundwater, and a recent Cabinet meeting has banned building any structure within 40 metres on both sides of major rivers in Kathmandu, Do such measures help keep the rivers alive or is that too little too late?Such decisions, in some way, seem to underscore the notion of giving space to rivers and maintaining their integrity. Building of septic tanks as part and parcel of new houses began in the 1970s as primary treatment units that can prevent the direct dumping of human waste into rivers and water bodies. The regular cleaning and safe disposal of waste from septic tanks are emerging questions. Rivers and waterscapes face much deeper challenges, however. The present water development model marches on like a mighty tusker, trampling in its path communities, villagers, residents, natural ecosystems, the terrestrial and aquatic beings, and past memories. Turning that around will require those working on water and river integrity across geographical, social, disciplinary and political boundaries to join hands in seeking changes and laying the foundation for a new ethical social contract for rivers and waterscapes as a first step in that long journey. \nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nMost economists believe spending on infrastructure has a significant multiplier effect. During the construction phase, infrastructure generates real cash flow for workers and their families. In the long run, it has a direct and indirect impact on the economy, with a multiplier effect, particularly in job creation.In Rupandehi, which hosts the industrial city Bhairahawa, and Lumbini, a landmark of the Buddhist world listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1997, infrastructure built with a sizeable investment has gone to waste.Big infrastructure projects like the international convention centre, meditation centre, industrial zones, and Gautam Buddha International Airport have failed to generate income and have turned into veritable white elephants.Nature has started reclaiming most of the under-utilised infrastructure.Since 2010, talk of building an international airport led to the construction of large-scale infrastructure, including a bevy of luxury hotels.Proliferating factories and a rapidly spreading transport network turned the Butwal-Bhairahawa metroplex into an economic powerhouse.Nepal opened its second international airport in May 2022 in the southern city of Bhairahawa, but no international flight stops there right now.The objective of building an international airport in Bhairahawa was to bring in more tourists, energise businesses and create jobs. But the situation is just the opposite. Traders are closing down their shops and moving abroad for decent jobs.The private sector, too, invested heavily. When the finished project started to sit idle, it hit the sector, and many enterprises were teetering into bankruptcy.Economists term this development in Lumbini a cascading failure—a breakdown in a system of interconnected parts in which the failure of one or few parts leads to the failure of other parts. Hem Raj Regmi, deputy chief statistician and data curator at the National Statistics Office, said Lumbini province saw heavy investment from the government and the private sector, but the output has slowed. “Enterprises are unable to raise even the operating cost.”In the last fiscal year, Lumbini province was estimated to grow at 4.05 percent to a GDP of Rs814 billion, from the low base of the 1.99 percent growth it had achieved in the previous fiscal year. Lumbini is estimated to contribute 14.26 percent to the national GDP. The highest value-added growth rate in Lumbini was in electricity and gas, which grew by 28.93 percent, while the manufacturing sector was estimated to shrink by a negative 1.43 percent in the last fiscal year.Most completed infrastructures in Lumbini have become white elephants, as their expenditures have been growing instead of them generating income. The Butwal International Convention Center, built with an investment of Rs1.11 billion in ward 10 of Butwal Sub Metropolis, is currently without business. The centre has 13 halls, each with a capacity to accommodate 2,700 people. The auditorium is the largest of the 13.The government built the convention centre to organise national and international conferences and events, but it is not generating much income. Construction started in 2014 and the centre was inaugurated in August 2022.Officials say that the centre is struggling to pay its staff. While the centre is under-utilised and lacks maintenance, bushes have grown around it.Dharmendra Panthi, chief of the Butwal International Convention Center project, said 22 events or functions have been conducted in the past three years, earning Rs4 million. The centre is currently closed as the provincial cabinet is yet to pass the operating guidelines even in three years.However, Panthi said they have been occasionally renting the hall on request. The centre charges Rs96,000 for a day-long event.Prabin Pathak, president of the Nepal Hoteliers Association, who took part in a recent function at the convention centre, said the infrastructure is in a sorry state due to lack of periodic maintenance.“If the building is not utilised properly, it will be a waste of tax money,” said Pathak. “The washroom faucets are dry, and it is difficult to sit in the hall due to the stench from the washroom.”“In Nepal, there is a growing trend of building new infrastructure, but their upkeep is often ignored. This is sad,” Pathak said. “No one is accountable for the losses the projects incur. Similarly, questions are raised about the quality of construction. In most projects, low-quality materials are used, severely compromising the structural integrity.”A hall with a capacity to accommodate 5,000 people built near the Buddha’s birthplace, Lumbini, has yet to do any business, except hosting a few functions. It was built with an investment of Rs720 million.Sanuraja Shakya, member-secretary of the Lumbini Development Trust, said that if a social organisation wants to conduct a function at the centre, they have to pay a fee.Shakya said that since it is a meditation centre, they do not allow other functions, especially those involving entertainment.Questions were raised about the construction when the roof started leaking soon after project’s completion. It was repaired later.Likewise, the Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in Bhairahawa, has not been fully operational for a long time. As factories have not been set up in the SEZ, the area has turned into a jungle. Construction of the SEZ had started in 2003 and it was inaugurated in 2014.Located in south-central Nepal, the Bhairahawa Special Economic Zone has 69 industrial plots of sizes from 1,400 to 3,700 square metres. A few industrialists have booked plots, but have not set up their plants as the government has failed to provide pledged services and amenities. The government had promised to provide 24-hour electricity, a one-stop service system, customs, banks, and insurance among other things inside the SEZ.“Every year, new entrepreneurs book plots, but do not set up their factories due to associated tough conditions,” said Saput Dumre, assistant director of SEZ. Dumre said industrialists are concerned about the mandatory export provision. According to SEZ guidelines, which were amended three months ago, firms that lease space inside the SEZ must export at least 30 percent of manufactured goods. “There is a water tank in the SEZ, but it has no water, the weighing machine does not work, the petrol pump is defunct, there are no parking areas, and the road is covered in thick bushes,” said Ujjwal Prasad Kasaju, a central member of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry. Then there is the new Gautam Buddha International Airport—all dressed up, and nowhere to go. The airport awaits applications for flight slots from international airlines after more than two years of opening.Nepal's second international airport was ready after ten years and nearly Rs40 billion pumped into the project, but despite the build-up, the expected rush of eager carriers is nowhere to be seen.The airport is a landmark located in south central Nepal and spread over 787 bighas (533 hectares).The modern facility has a 15,169-square-metre terminal building that can serve nearly a million passengers a year. The airport's 3,000-metre runway is long enough to handle the largest commercial jets. However, no commercial jet wants to fly to the airport. \nKunwar has been the MD for just under three years. Before coming back to her homeland to join Daraz Nepal, she worked at different American companies, including Amazon, the world’s biggest e-commerce platform.

At the meeting, Sharma asked Dahal to step down as party chairman. Dahal has led the party uninterruptedly for over three-and-a-half decades.At the end of the standing committee meeting, leaders had said that the differences between Dahal and Sharma were resolved. But that conclusion seems premature. The two were busy accusing and criticising each other at a public function in Kathmandu. Dahal had to pacify Sharma on Saturday as he complained of not being trusted by Dahal and other Maoist leaders. “When I was assigned to build an alliance with the CPN-UML, I worked for the same but was tagged as KP Oli’s man,” Sharma said at the function. Later, the Maoist Centre decided to ally with the Nepali Congress, and he worked for the same as directed by Dahal, Sharma claimed. “But I was dubbed Sher Bahadur Deuba’s man. When will I be called the Maoist party’s man? When will you call me Prachanda’s man?” said Sharma, pointing to Dahal, who was sitting at the same podium as the chief guest.Taken aback, Dahal seemed to be consoling Sharma saying that comrade Prabhakar [Sharma] would never split the party, contrary to some media reports.Dahal rubbished reports that Sharma was trying to split the party as baseless and that the days-long standing committee meeting had dispelled all rumours.The Maoist party chief and former prime minister, however, admitted that there were still some confusions and that the meeting had decided to look into the matter and make things clear and resolve them with joint effort.Soon after the party was out of the government, it called the meetings of the standing committee and the secretariat and discussed the Maoist CEntre's future course, including unity with other fringe parties, strengthening the Socialist Front, and building the party’s organisation.“There were some matters of serious suspicion and some still exist. And the meeting has decided to study and find how such a situation of suspicion emerged,” Dahal said. The Maoist leader promised to study the issue jointly with Sharma and, if needed, the party may form a probe committee.“We have reached an understanding to properly address the remaining concerns as well,” Dahal added.Sharma is not alone in demanding that Dahal handover the party’s reins.Even Maoist Centre senior vice-chair Narayan Kaji Shrestha has asked Dahal to quit the leadership position. A large number of Maoist leaders at the central as well as lower committees want to see an overhaul of the party, said a central member.“If we fail to transform the party, there will be no hope for us besides surrendering to other parties in the 2027 elections,” the leader said.Another central committee member however doesn’t trust Dahal to build the party organisation. “Dahal would rather forge unity with other left parties and, if possible, explore options to contest the upcoming elections jointly with CPN-UML, the country’s largest communist party,” said the central member.The leader said he was unsure if the ruling UML would turn down Dahal’s proposal to join hands once again. According to him, Dahal’s strategy is to bring together left-leaning parties and put pressure on the UML, which leads the government with the backing of the Nepali Congress, to make an electoral alliance with the Maoists. The leader argues that the UML is preparing itself internally to contest the elections on its own, without allying with anyone.“This is the beginning of an infighting in the Maoist Centre because we abandoned the agenda of strengthening the federal, republican and secular Nepal,” said Ram Karki, secretary of the Maoist Centre. “This tussle is unlikely to stop anytime soon.”Because the conflict emerged under Dahal’s ‘schooling’, Karki claimed.He recalled that Mohan Baidya, who supported Dahal’s school of thought, engaged in a similar tussle before leaving the party. That conflict did not subside but intensified, leading Baidya to finally split the party, Karki observed.Later, Baburam Bhattarai, who also emerged allegedly from Dahal’s schooling, led a similar revolt, Karki recalled. “He also deserted the party. This time, too, the tussle has surfaced among those schooled under Dahal, so no one knows the outcome,” said Karki.For decades, Sharma remained a close confidant of Dahal. But he grew up to be a dissident after Dahal refused to appoint him the general secretary last year. Another deputy general secretary, Barsha Man Pun, was also an aspirant for the post of general secretary.Sharma and Pun are taken as Dahal’s lieutenants, right from the launch of the Maoist insurgency in 1996. Sidelining both during the 2022 party general convention, Dahal picked Dev Gurung, who had little influence in the party.Karki described the Congress-UML alliance’s move to oust the Maoist Centre from the government as a good opportunity to strengthen the Maoist party.“If the Nepali Congress and the UML hadn’t ejected our party from the government, we would have been finished by the time of next elections,” said Karki. “As we have been removed from power three years ahead of the election, there is some room for transformation.”Senior party leaders have given Dahal two options: transform himself and the party or vacate the chair that he has been occupying for over 35 years.Another central committee member said that if the conflict was an internal matter and the fight genuine, the party would emerge unscathed. “Otherwise, if external factors are working within the party, then the party will face a serious crisis,” said the leader.However, some Maoist leaders are confident that the party will not face a grave crisis. “Janardan ji questioned the party leadership. Isn’t that a good practice in the party?” said Yubaraj Chaulagain, a central committee member. “However, Chairman Dahal is addressing them.”Chaulagain said that the party leadership would collect reports from the party’s provincial committees and sister organisations and take the right decision based on them. “There’s the proposal for the party’s transformation. It will be discussed. We will gather more feedback and ideas from the lower committees, and follow them,” said Chaulagain. “Gradually, we will address the issues raised by Janardan ji.” \nCPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who has been leading the party for over three-and-a-half decades, has yet again pacified the leaders who want him to hand over the leadership.Janardan Sharma and Barsha Man Pun—deputy general secretaries of the Maoist party—had demanded that Dahal hand over the party leadership to a leader of their generation. The two leaders raised the issue during the standing committee meeting that commenced on August 9.Leaders concluded the meeting on Thursday as they decided to strengthen the Maoist party through internal dialogue between the leaders on their disagreements.Party secretary Ram Karki said that responding to the questions raised during the standing committee meeting on August 10, party chair Dahal vowed to address their issues.The party will resolve the theoretical as well as ideological differences among the party leaders through dialogue, Karki told the Post, quoting Dahal.On August 9, the first day of the meeting, the Maoist chair presented a verbal proposal on current political affairs, party building, and other pertinent issues.After Dahal’s presentation, some leaders raised questions about the party’s policies and leadership. Among them, Janardan Sharma, a deputy general secretary, submitted a written proposal on August 10, calling for a review of Dahal’s leadership and suggesting that the party chair be limited to a ceremonial role as patron.In his document, Sharma alleged, among other things, that the party leadership was trying to use state power against him.In the 14-page document submitted to the meeting, Sharma accused the party leadership of ‘spreading disinformation’ about him and the other deputy general secretary, Pun. He also accused the top leaders of even misusing state power against him.“The fake information about the party split, which was generated from Khumaltar [the private residence of Dahal], spread widely after reaching Baluwatar [the prime minister’s official residence where Dahal was staying until last month when the government changed],” Sharma questions the party leadership in his document. “There are questions: why did the leadership disseminate fake information?”However, Maoist Centre leaders said the issue has been settled, for now, after Dahal pledged to resolve it through intra-party discussions.Party chair Dahal, while speaking to the press briefly after the conclusion of the standing committee meeting on Thursday, said the reports and rumours about party split were baseless.“Rumours related to the party split led by comrade Prabhakar [Janardan Sharma] are baseless,” Dahal told journalists.The meeting also decided to hold consultative meetings at the provincial level, where the party's office bearers will also participate. After the meeting, the party will call for a full-fledged meeting of the central committee in mid-September (Ashoj first week).Another party secretary, Devendra Paudel, said the upcoming central committee meeting will call the party's special general convention, as decided during the eigth general convention held in 2022.But Lilamani Pokharel, a party secretary, says no decision was taken with regard to convening a special general convention as only the central committee has a mandate to call a special general convention, the supreme body of a party that can take final decisions on the party’s policies and leadership.“The party will go for a special general convention only if a central committee meeting decides to go for that,” Pokharel told the Post.After the party was out of the government in mid-July, calls for Dahal to relinquish the top position have grown. Haribol Gajurel, a close aide of Dahal and deputy general secretary, also raised the issue of leadership change during a meeting of party officials before the standing committee meeting and demanded a special congress to address the issues.Gajurel proposed that all office-bearers should resign and make a fresh start to rejuvenate the party. He even submitted his own resignation as a starting point. Following this, on the second day of the standing committee meeting held on August 10, Deputy General Secretary Sharma questioned the central leadership in his political paper.However, party spokesperson Agni Sapkota, who is close to Dahal, argued that the questions raised by Sharma were aimed at strengthening the party. “The issue I raised during the standing committee meeting was for the betterment of the party and to strengthen the leadership of Dahal,” Sapkota quoted Sharma as saying.“The party leadership has also taken the issue raised by the standing committee members, including deputy general secretary Gajurel, Sharma, and Barshaman Pun, on a positive note.”During Dahal's tenure as prime minister, Gajurel, his political adviser, had previously expressed dissatisfaction with the party's lack of adherence to procedures and methods. As questions arose about the central leadership of the Maoist Centre, which is focused on organisational development, Dahal found himself in a defensive position during the standing committee meeting. According to party insiders, it was after a long time that Dahal faced tremendous pressure during a standing committee meeting as both Sharma and Pun, who have strong command in the party organisation, stood together to demand Dahal’s exit from the party leadership. It was something unusual for Maoist leaders as the two leaders, who defended Dahal in the past, joined hands by closing their ranks to fiercely criticise the party chief. Sharma and Pun, both former finance ministers, are deemed the two most powerful leaders after Dahal.Both leaders claimed the position of general secretary at the party’s general convention in early 2022. Though they were willing to contest for the post, Dahal instead chose Dev Gurung as the general secretary. After the general convention, Sharma has been maintaining a distance from Dahal and he challenges the party chief on various occasions. Of late, Pun, too, has joined Sharma to challenge Dahal. At the standing committee meeting, Pun said there should be a debate on the party's chairperson's term limit. \"Instead of discussing whether the leader should step down now, we need to determine the chair’s term limit,\" he added. Leaders said Dahal faced a pressure of this scale in a party meeting probably for the first time in nearly a decade, since the exit of key leaders Baburam Bhattarai and Mohan Baidya. Bhattarai and Baidya lead their own parties now. \nForeign Minister Arzu Rana is set to visit India from August 18-21, on her first official trip after taking office.The visit by the foreign minister comes a week after new Indian foreign secretary Vikram Misri concluded a two–day familiarisation visit to Nepal just this week. During her time in India, according to the foreign ministry officials, Rana will hold talks with her Indian counterpart S Jaishankar and other officials and discuss several issues of mutual interests.Separate requests have been sent for meetings with Indian PresidentDroupadi Murmu and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, with confirmation still pending, according to foreign ministry officials privy to the visit preparations. She will also meet senior Bharatiya Janata Party leaders.“We are waiting for confirmation for both the meetings as Prime Minister KP Oli is keen to host Indian Prime Minister Modi in Nepal,” an official said. “It is the Indian prime minister's turn to visit Nepal, so our focus would be on making that visit happen,” the official said. Rana was planning to visit Delhi for a routine health checkup, but after India expressed interest in turning it into an official visit, she received an invitation from her Indian counterpart, Jaishankar, sources at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.Rana and Jaishankar are scheduled to meet in New Delhi on Monday to discuss issues from the seventh joint commission meeting in Kathmandu earlier this year, according to the officials.The Joint Commission meeting reviewed all aspects of bilateral relations and areas of cooperation including connectivity, infrastructure development, economic partnership, trade, transit, investment, power, water resources, culture, tourism, sports, health and education.During her meeting with Misri on Monday, Rana requested additional air routes to Nepal to increase air connectivity between Nepal and India, setting up a sophisticated laboratory at the Nepal-India border to test the quality of the vegetables and fruits imported from India for pesticides, expediting the negotiations for the finalisation of the detailed project report of the Pancheshwar Multipurpose Project that remains in limbo for years. They also discussed issues such as discharging the water from the Tanakpur canal, river training in the Banganga, Khado, and Rapti rivers with Indian assistance, and the inauguration of the suspension bridge in Darchula linking Nepal and India, according to the foreign ministry statement. The upcoming visit is expected to focus on discussing matters of mutual interest rather than signing understandings or agreements, a joint secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the Post. \nA parliamentary committee debates the inclusion and duration of a statute of limitations in corruption cases in Nepal, with disagreements among parties and concerns over potential loopholes for powerful individuals.\nKathmandu City expanded its building ban along rivers from 20 to 40 meters, halting ongoing construction and prohibiting water pollution under Supreme Court orders.\nAfter a century-long hiatus, the Lakhe dance is being revived in Bhaktapur by young dancers, conserving cultural heritage, fostering community, and potentially boosting tourism.\nLions Club Nepal felicitated individuals and businesses for their social contributions; from journalists to celebrities, and corporates to bureaucrats.\nKathmandu Valley to observe public holiday on Sunday for Bhoto Jatra, an annual religious festival celebrating the God of rain, Machhindranath, with a chariot-pulling finale in Lalitpur.\nIn Kathmandu, where construction dust often clouds the air, the resumption of the pavement widening project at New Road on July 17 has elicited mixed reactions. While some citizens harbour doubts and disagreements, people with disabilities have their fingers crossed as well. For Narayani Dawadi, who is visually impaired, the initiative offers hope and apprehension in equal measures. She worries that the Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) might overlook the parameters for disabled-friendly infrastructure and execute the project superficially.Dawadi’s scepticism is not unwarranted. Her distrust stems from her 20 years of experience navigating Kathmandu, where she has become familiar with its footpaths and pavements. Despite this familiarity, she cannot navigate confidently due to the ever-changing, unpredictable condition of the pavements.“I don’t know if I can call the footpaths accessible,” Dawadi says. “There is tactile paving for white cane users but it’s not perfect. Sometimes they guide us to a pole or a tree, and in many places, there are only partial tactile guides, leaving us confused.”Her experience highlights a recurring issue: lack of a reliable, consistent infrastructure for people with disabilities in Kathmandu.The roads and footpaths that appear fine during the day are often damaged or under-construction by the evening, giving people with disabilities a hard time navigating them.Dawadi isn’t entirely critical; she appreciates the KMC’s sidewalk widening projects and regulations on street vending and parking. Areas like Baneshwar have become much easier to navigate, Dawadi says.However, Dawadi hopes the KMC doesn’t just displace street vendors without providing alternatives. “They need options that won’t affect their income; a crackdown won’t work.”Dawadi emphasises that KMC shouldn’t view current projects as a complete solution to make public infrastructure ‘disabled-friendly.’ Issues like half-finished tactile paving, narrow roads, and misplaced poles and tiles need to be addressed. “People with disabilities should be involved in planning,” she says.Rishi Dhakal, 44, a wheelchair user for the past 21 years and president of the Spinal Cord Injury Network Nepal, says that while the KMC has been building new footpaths and pavements with nice bricks and tiles, they often fail to meet the measurements for wheelchair use.Rishi notes that the footpath in Narayantar, between Bagmati Bridge to Jorpati Chowk, has become easier for pedestrians and the visually impaired due to reduced parking and fewer street vendors. But it remains inaccessible for wheelchair users due to a lack of proper slopes.“On many footpaths, especially at crossroads, the slope is not favourable for wheelchairs to climb,” he explains. “The footpath has become just a showpiece.”Rishi and his organisation are working to arrange a meeting with the minister and secretary of the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport to present a memorandum advocating for wheelchair-friendly slopes on Kathmandu’s footpaths. On July 21, Rishi met with the ministry’s Joint Secretary Sushil Babu Dhakal to discuss the next steps.While Rishi appreciates the ongoing work to widen pavements on New Road, he doubts the standard measurements for slopes and inclined planes for wheelchair users will be adhered to, citing KMC’s recent work on footpaths near Tribhuvan International Airport where the slopes are inaccessible.Another wheelchair user, Muskan Adhikari, pointed to a double problem of inaccessibility: footpaths lack slopes, and the sky bridges are not wheelchair-friendly. Moreover, she has faced incidents where vehicles did not stop at crossings when traffic police were absent, leading to several close calls.Rishi’s organisation has also received reports of incidents of wheelchair users being hit by vehicles in the Jorpati area.“The constitution promises accessible infrastructure for people with disabilities to navigate independently, but the current footpaths and infrastructure makes independent travel very difficult,” Adhikari said. “Forget pavements, even government offices are not accessible.”Rishi says that even the Health Ministry is only accessible up to the first floor, “forcing us to wait all day for meetings as ministers do not sit on the first floor.” This lack of accessibility extends to the KMC office itself, which has a metal ramp that is extremely difficult for wheelchair users to use and there is no tactile paving either.Vishwo Shrestha, director at the Blind Youth Association Nepal, reveals that their organisation frequently receives reports of blind and visually impaired individuals falling into sewers and rivers due to inadequate safety measures. In Sukedhara, where several offices catering to the blind community are located, a lack of proper fences along Dhobikhola river had previously resulted in accidents. The association had petitioned the KMC a year and a half ago for guard rails or road safety barriers.“Despite the installation of guard rails, there have been recent cases of individuals falling into the river due to gaps in the barriers,” Shrestha says. Shrestha adds that while not all incidents are reported, they receive two to three cases every two months involving falls into rivers or sewers. Many incidents involving collisions with poles or trees due to poor tactile guidance or uneven footpaths go unreported. “This reflects a major failure of the state’s duty,” he said.Meanwhile, for 36-year-old Radha Kumal, a blind white cane user, problems in footpaths and pavements are just part of the larger problems in the country’s road infrastructure. “We don’t know where the zebra cross begins, and traffic lights are useless for us as we cannot see the colour change,” she says. Many like Kumal hope for audio signals at traffic lights to ensure safe and independent road crossings.Sukhdev Ray, 41, who is deaf and lives in Baneshwar, points out a different but equally critical issue: lack of proper signage. “Without clear directional signs in public spaces like pavements, it’s hard for us to find our destinations,” Ray says. “As I can’t hear, I rely on signs for guidance.”Ray also adds that many traffic lights either malfunction or are ignored by drivers. “Crossing the road can be chaotic,” he notes. “With drivers in a rush and traffic lights often disregarded, I often fear getting hit, like I was the last time.”Ray was hit by a motorcycle while walking at Satdobato four months ago. Though he didn’t suffer major injuries, he is still reminded of the incident while walking on the road. He was also hit by a Safa tempo twice in Bhaisepati in June.Sugam Bhattarai, general secretary of the National Federation of the Disabled Nepal (NFDN), acknowledges that the KMC’s new footpaths and railings are a step forward but “they are usually limited to major areas like New Road and lack comprehensive accessibility features.”According to Bhattarai, in Nepal, the term ‘disabled-friendly’ often translates to just adding tactile paving and a ramp, ticking off an ‘inclusivity checklist’ without genuinely addressing accessibility needs. “What about individuals with deafness or intellectual disabilities?” he questions. The Act Relating to Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 2017, and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD), which Nepal has ratified, mandate accessibility to infrastructure.Article 9 of the UNCRPD says, “States Parties shall take appropriate measures to ensure to persons with disabilities access to the physical environment, transportation, information and communications, and other facilities and services open or provided to the public, both in urban and in rural areas.”Despite these legal frameworks, implementation remains inconsistent.Kumal shared that the ongoing pavement widening project at New Road has uprooted both sides of the road, leaving no alternative paths or assistance for the blind. “There’s no guidance or facilities for us,” she said.Shrestha criticises the KMC’s approach for lacking provisions for the blind and visually impaired. “Construction continues without first ensuring alternative routes or proper information,” he said.Nabin Manandhar, spokesperson for the KMC, assures that their pavement widening project at New Road includes considerations for disability access. “While we’re committed to making footpaths accessible, we’re not yet at the stage where we can address all types of disabilities,” he said.“We’ve just started. We welcome suggestions and acknowledge that we can’t address every issue alone.”Baburam Bhattarai, an expert member at the City Planning Commission under the KMC, emphasised that new projects adhere to disability guidelines. “We are monitoring compliance and plan to address issues with old pavements, including complaints about obstructing electric poles,” he said.However, officials blame funding constraints as a barrier in implementing good ideas.In 2021, the Department of Roads allocated Rs50 million for disabled-friendly pavements. The first phase (1.5km from Putalisadak to Thapathali) was completed, but the second phase at Durbarmarg and Jamal was halted due to budget constraints, according to Narayan Dutta Bhandari, division chief of the Road Division of Kathmandu.Rishi said that they, along with the NFDN, will start monitoring construction across the capital. If the right parameters are not followed, they will negotiate with the KMC, even if it means halting the work, he said.“We’ve learned to navigate the inconveniences in Kathmandu’s pavements and roads, but that doesn’t mean they’re not problematic,” Kumal says. “Accessible infrastructure is our right. While we do our best to adapt, we expect the government to adapt to our needs as well.” \nGoat rearing has attracted farmers in Rolpa, a hill district in Nepal’s midwest. There are 59 households in Korchabang where most families have started commercial goat rearing.Lush forests, plants and trees and a good source of water make commercial goat rearing feasible in Rolpa, the heartland of the decade-long Maoist war that ended in 2006.In recent years, farmers have started growing different varieties of grasses in the villages too.Jokh Bahadur Gharti Magar, a farmer from Minahi, Korchabang, who is popular in the village for rearing many goats, said he is not worried about wild grass as he himself grows the varieties rich in nutrients on his farmland. He can also source fodder from the nearby forest.Magar, who runs a hotel in Minahi, is supported by his family for commercial goat keeping.“I started with a small investment. Later, my family helped me with more funds to increase the number of goats,” said Magar. The veterinary hospital in the district and the animal husbandry centre have also helped Magar and other farmers in their enterprise.The Smart Krishi Gaun programme run by the government for the past three years recognises Magar is one of the successful entrepreneurs. Magar is among high earners from goat rearing in Korchabang. As grass production is good in the area, farmers find the business highly profitable, said Bhim Prakash Pun, president of a farmers’ group.The government, through the veterinary hospital in Rolpa and the Livestock Service Centre, has implemented animal rearing programmes in the region. The Smart Krishi Gaun Programme Implementation Committee looks after agricultural affairs. Kaman Buda, a local politician, said rearing goats by building modern sheds is becoming more profitable.The farmers are rearing goats in better ways and have an income even in the rainy season. It is improving the economic situation, said Prasash Pun Magar, chairman of the Madi rural municipality ward 6. Among 59 farmers rearing goats, the annual incomes of 15 are good.Bhim Prakash Pun, who was in politics before taking up goat rearing, presides over the farmers’ group. He leads the Korchabang Smart Krishi Gaun Programme Implementation Committee.“Commercial goat rearing has become a major source of our income,” Pun said. The implementation of the Smart Krishi Programme and learning about modern ways of raising goats encouraged villagers to start the business. “So I started spending less time in politics and more in business.”The goat rearing initiative under the Smart Krishi Programme started in 2020. Farmers have been trained to cultivate grasses and manage sheds in modern ways.Pun has 20–25 goats, after selling 15 he-goats and 15 kids at once. The money goes to the education of children and household expenses.Around 15 to 20 households in Korchabang have started goat rearing as a major business.Technicians taught the farmers to build modern sheds. They also learnt grass cultivation and feed preparation, said Dr Shankar Neupane, chief of Veterinary and Animal Service Expert Centre. Training on financial transactions was also imparted.To make the 59 farmers entrepreneurs, the government has spent around Rs10.5 million, Neupane said. Jokh Bahadur Gharti Magar, a local farmer, said that the financial and technical support from the government was a big help for them.“From the hotel business, I came back to agriculture and livestock rearing,” Magar said. “After much thought, I took up goat farming by making a modern shed.”Gharti Magar, a former weightlifter, is happy as a farmer. He has 28 goats in the shed and has requested the provincial and federal governments to introduce additional programmes and provide another technician.Subha Bahadur Budhamagar, who also took to commercial goat rearing after a long teaching career, earns well.The government is doing proper inspection, said Matilal Kunwar, officer at Veterinary Hospital and Livestock Service Expert Center.Tirtha Raj Pun and Kaman Budha are rearing goats in Punthok and Jyang villages, respectively. Pun started with four goats and now has 10.Kaman Budha, who is also a trader, served villagers as a social worker. He rears 10–15 goats and takes them to Dang to sell. \nBarahi Jungle Lodge has been announced as Nepal’s first hotel to receive certification under the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC) Hotel Sustainability Basics programme.This certification recognises hotels that excel in sustainability by implementing essential criteria for responsible operations. Barahi Jungle Lodge’s achievement highlights its excellence in three core areas: energy efficiency, planet-friendly operations, and community support. The lodge has implemented various measures, including reducing energy consumption, eliminating single-use plastics, and actively supporting local communities. This dedication sets a new benchmark for sustainable hospitality in Nepal. In addition to the WTTC certification, Barahi Jungle Lodge has also been awarded the TOFTigers Outstanding Certification, a testament to its commitment to conservation and responsible tourism.The WTTC’s Hotel Sustainability Basics is a global standard designed to guide hotels in their sustainability journey, with 12 fundamental criteria covering environmental, social, and operational practices. \nAfter the devastating earthquakes in 2015, Nepal saw a dramatic shift in dietary habits, stimulated by the inflow of cash for reconstruction. This massive cash inflow also led to an explosion in the availability of packaged snack foods.Now, people are avid consumers of fast food and packaged foods, and the trading and manufacturing of such food businesses are growing exponentially.This inadvertently increased the demand for unhealthy foods as people become accustomed to readily available options, according to the Global Food Policy Report 2024, published by the International Food Policy Research Institute recently.These foods with low nutritional content are packaged and ready to eat at any given point.“The emergency food aid provided after the earthquake included packaged foods like instant noodles,” the report said.Poor diet quality is a significant reason for poor nutrition outcomes. The report, authored by multiple experts, covers Africa, the Middle East and North Africa, Central Asia, South Asia, East and South East Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean.According to the report, 45 percent of Nepal's population consumes salty and fried snacks. The country's vegetable intake has been poor, with 11 percent of the population consuming “zero” vegetables and fruits.The report said progress is slowing on reducing undernutrition and micronutrient deficiencies in low- and middle-income countries while observing a rapid rise in overweight and obesity rates. This double burden of malnutrition—where undernutrition coexists with diet-related noncommunicable diseases—poses significant global health challenges.The report also stresses that food systems significantly contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and environmental degradation, urging their transformation to reduce environmental impacts while ensuring food security. Malnutrition rates remain high, and non-communicable diseases are rising in South Asia.“With the increased consumption of packaged food, particularly by the children, it has sharply increased childhood obesity. Overconsumption of zero nutrition and zero calorie packaged food has increased the malnutrition rate in children, especially school-age ones,” said Dr Sudhashree Adhikari, a nutritionist.“Immature growth in children and disturbance in the menstruation cycle is being seen in women, largely due to the consumption of packaged and processed meat and dairy products. These products often contain growth hormones used in poultry, dairy, and cattle production.”“Producers inject hormonal growth supplements into poultry to speed up production, and these hormones get stored in the animal’s organs,” she said. “When people consume these products, it can lead to hormonal imbalances.”Adhikari said that hormonal imbalance in women and chronic hypertension and diabetes in men have sharply gone up mainly due to the high intake of carbohydrates that are found in packaged and processed food.According to experts, the low and middle-income brackets have been cutting their healthy food intake from their plates with the rising prices of vegetables and dairy products.The report said nearly 80 percent of Nepal's population cannot afford a healthy diet as healthier food options cost more in countries with poorer infrastructure and logistics.It has been several months since the prices of most green vegetables crossed over Rs100 per kg. For instance, even a kg of bottle gourd, a common and seasonal vegetable, costs around Rs120 per kg in retail.As Nepal does not produce enough fruits, most of the fruit requirements are fulfilled through imports. For example, a kg of Chinese Fuji apples costs around Rs400.The report said that only 1.1 percent of Nepali adults (over 15 years old) consume 400 grams of fruits and vegetables daily, which is the WHO's recommendation.Fruits and vegetables are rich sources of vitamins, minerals, fibre, and antioxidants that protect against numerous diseases.According to Nepal Rastra Bank, vegetable inflation increased by 16.02 percent in mid-June compared to last year.For example, lately, dairy companies have struggled to sell milk. They have converted the milk into powder and butter, but even these products remain unsold, leaving tonnes of the products piling up in the warehouses of the state-owned and private dairies.Both state-owned and private dairy companies said the ongoing economic slowdown has dampened dairy demand, resulting in stopped cash flow and rising liabilities to farmers as products remained unsold for several months.Nepal’s growth rate, which measures the country’s output and people's income, has remained dismal, averaging 3.4 percent in the last five years.Import figures show the clear picture of how packaged foods have grown and displaced traditional food habit systems.According to the Department of Customs, Nepal imported 2,420 tonnes of chocolates worth Rs1.66 billion in the last fiscal year ended July 15.The country also imported 4,146 tonnes of sweet biscuits worth Rs997.62 million, 1,657 tonnes of Kurkure and Lays worth Rs911.78 million, 2,818 tonnes of dalmoth and namkeen worth Rs800.95 million, and 1,867 tonnes of packaged bakery items worth Rs612.58 million.The country imported 1,609 tonnes of chewing gum worth Rs582.74 and 1,478 frozen French fries worth Rs226.26 million.Hem Raj Regmi, the deputy chief statistician at the National Statistics Office, said that packaged and processed food consumption is increasing in the country mainly due to rapid urbanisation, a rise in single families, a growing number of working women, and changing food habits.“The remittance is the key. It has fueled the consumption of such products,” said Regmi, who holds a doctoral (PhD) in food security.He said that remittances affect food expenditure in two distinct ways.“When you have money, you increase your calorie intake, but income from remittances may also compound trends toward purchasing less healthy foods associated with the nutrition transition.”Experts said that unchecked sale of packaged and processed food items, especially in rural parts of the country, easy availability of counterfeit food and beverage products with no quality inspection, and the import of packaged food products high in palm oil and sugar are causing severe health issues in the majority of people.The government's lax inspection has also led to an increase in traders selling expired food items by relabeling them.In Nepal, 39 percent of the population consumes all five recommended food groups, including at least one starchy staple, one vegetable, one fruit, one pulse, one nut and seed, and one animal-source food, the study states.The report said poor diets are caused by a mix of factors: insufficient crop diversity; low affordability due to low per capita income and higher prices of nutritious foods; inefficient, underdeveloped markets and value chains; easy access to highly processed foods; and aggressive promotion.According to the poultry association, an egg now costs around Rs25 in retail, up from Rs17 a year earlier and has become out of reach for most low-income people.The report said that in 2050, no countries in sub-Saharan Africa and few countries in Asia and the Pacific could supply the World Health Organization’s minimum recommended daily per capita intake of 400 grams of fruits and vegetables.Adhikari said that vegetables and fruits fulfil the required micronutrients, like vitamins and minerals. Live enzymes, Vitamin B12, and calcium are also found in vegetables and fruits, and such products are less consumed. \nDespite regular supply, the prices of most vegetables in Kathmandu Valley have gone up sharply, forcing the majority of Nepalis to cut the recommended daily vegetable intake.Traders said that farmers have increased the rates of vegetables due to the rise in the cost of production.The comparative price index of the wholesale vegetable market in Kalimati shows that the price of vegetables like tomatoes, potatoes, onions, and other seasonal and non-seasonal vegetables has increased within two weeks.“The supply situation is normal,” said Binay Shrestha, information officer at the Kalimati Fruits and Vegetable Market Development Board, the country’s largest vegetables and fruits marketplace. “Normally, the vegetable price goes up in the rainy season. This year, farmers have increased the prices of their crops, and as a result, prices have increased sharply.”He said that farmers’ crops have been hit by excessive rainfall. The heatwave, too, affected production. “To compensate for their losses, vegetable prices increased at the farm gate.”The Kalimati market received over 700 tonnes of vegetables on Wednesday, which is considered a normal supply.The wholesale price of all three different types of tomatoes has increased. The price of tomato big (Nepali) has increased by 26.67 percent to Rs95 per kg, while the price of tomato small (local) has jumped by 101.52 percent to Rs45 per kg, and the price of tomato small (tunnel) has gone up by 92.13 percent to Rs61 per kg.The potato price has also increased significantly. The price of potato red (Indian) has increased by 3.64 percent to Rs57 per kg, potato red (Mudhe) has gone up by 15.69 percent to Rs59 per kg, and potato white has risen by 4.57 percent to Rs53.33 per kg.The dry onion price increased by 18.63 percent to Rs97.67 per kg. Shrestha said the onion price has been impacted by the rise in the Indian onion price.The wholesale price of cabbage (local) has jumped by 30.05 percent to Rs75 per kg within two weeks. The wholesale price of cauli local (Jyapu) has also risen by 15.79 percent to Rs110 per kg.On Thursday, the Cowpea (long) price increased by 26.67 percent to Rs95 per kg.The price of bottle gourd has increased by 28.57 percent to Rs45 per kg and smooth gourd by 28.57 percent to Rs45 per kg.Despite being seasonal vegetables, the price of pointed gourds has increased. The wholesale price is Rs75 per kg, up 36.36 percent.Similarly, the price of French beans (local) increased by 46.15 percent to Rs95 per kg, while the price of French beans (hybrid) also increased by 46.15 percent to Rs95 per kg within two weeks.The wholesale price of sword beans climbed by 4.55 percent to Rs115 per kg.The prices of squash (round) and okra have also gone up. The squash round price has gone up 30.77 percent to Rs85 per kg, and the okra price has gone up 28.57 percent to Rs45 per kg.According to Nepal Rastra Bank, vegetable inflation increased by 16.02 percent in mid-June compared to the same period last year.A separate report said that Nepalis are consuming fewer vegetables and fruits due to cost factors and their growing habit of consuming packaged foods.According to Global Food Policy Report 2024, published by the International Food Policy Research Institute last month, in Nepal’s capital, Kathmandu, children under two years get a quarter of their calories from unhealthy snack foods and beverages.The report said that only 1.1 percent of Nepalis adults (over 15 years old) consume 400 grams of fruits and vegetables daily, which is the WHO's recommendation. The report showed that Nepal’s consumption of salty and fried snacks is high among South Asian nations, with more than 40 percent of the population eating them.Fruits and vegetables are rich sources of vitamins, minerals, fibre, and antioxidants that protect against numerous diseases.The report said that in 2050, no countries in sub-Saharan Africa and few countries in Asia and the Pacific could supply the World Health Organization’s minimum recommended daily per capita intake of 400 grams of fruits and vegetables.The cost premium—that is, the additional cost for the least-cost nutrient-adequate diet above the least-cost source of calorie adequacy—is larger in South Asia than in any other region.For example, dark green leafy vegetables and vitamin A-rich fruits and vegetables cost 8 to 22 times more per calorie than starchy staples and twice as much per calorie as sugary and salty snacks.A study in a low-income country revealed substantial changes in food behaviours over the past decade, with increased consumption of rice, meat, and highly processed snack foods. \nAmid heavy rainfall in many places across the country, Anbukhaireni Rural Municipality of Tanahun district has been hit by a massive dengue outbreak, with over 900 positive cases in a single ward within a month.Local health facilities are struggling to cope with the overwhelming number of seriously ill patients.“Over 900 people from ward 3 have tested positive for dengue within a month,” Agam Raj Upadhyaya, health coordinator of the rural municipality, told the Post over the phone from Anbukhaireni. “Forty-five patients are currently being treated on just 15 beds at Anbukhaireni Hospital. The hospital floors and corridors are packed with infected people.”Health officials warn that the actual number of dengue cases could be higher, as people having mild symptoms are not getting tested and are resting at home.They also informed that around two dozen seriously ill patients have been sent to Chitwan, Pokhara, and Kathmandu for further treatment.“What worries us most is that with the spike in positive cases, we are also seeing an increase in seriously ill patients,” said Upadhyaya. “These patients need intensive care, which is why we have to refer them to Chitwan, Kathmandu and Pokhara.”Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika, according to the World Health Organisation.So far two died and 3755 tested positive with the dengue virus that has spread in 74 districts across the country.Public health experts say the real number of infections could be several times higher, as the government’s case reporting system is not very effective, and more than 80 percent of the cases are asymptomatic. Data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division shows that only 715 people have tested positive for the virus in Tanahun, far less than what is reported by the rural municipality.“We don’t know how they are counting, but we have reported all the confirmed cases,” said Upadhyaya.Other health officials also told the Post that health authorities are misrepresenting the true extent of dengue infection and deaths.Public health experts warn that dengue cases could escalate in the coming days as heavy rainfall continues across the country and post-monsoons season, which is considered the main dengue season, is yet to start.“The coming days will be more challenging for us, as dengue cases could surge,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at Shukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital at Teku in Kathmandu.Public health experts criticise the authorities for their narrow focus on merely counting cases and deaths, which does little to control the spread of the deadly disease.Experts say the disease will not stop spreading unless the lessons and experiences gained from previous outbreaks are implemented.Meanwhile, the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division on Friday issued new guidelines to control the spread of the dengue virus. The guidelines stress the need for searching and destroying mosquito larvae, but do not recommend insecticide spraying, as past experience shows that this measure is futile in controlling the epidemic.Officials say fogging with insecticides is only a symbolic measure and does not effectively kill larvae, pupae, or eggs, particularly if done during the day. Experts say a massive awareness campaign is instrumental in destroying the breeding ground of the dengue-spreading vector, and the public must be made aware of the treatment.Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms, which do not need any treatment or can be treated with paracetamol at home.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects such as plastic cups and bottles could be breeding grounds for dengue-carrying mosquitoes.According to doctors, mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache and pain in the eyes are some of the symptoms of dengue. Doctors advise that those with these symptoms should seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and access to proper medical care can lower fatalities.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district. Since then, an increasing number of dengue infections, including major outbreaks, have been reported from many districts.At least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts in 2023.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Though the post-monsoon period is considered the dengue epidemic season, the deadly disease has already become endemic in Nepal, as outbreaks are reported every month, including in the winter months. \nThe Epidemiology and Disease Control Division has alerted all agencies concerned about the growing risk of the spread of mpox, also known as the monkeypox virus, in communities.The division’s alert follows Wednesday's declaration of a global public health emergency by the World Health Organisation. The UN agency defines an international public health emergency as an “extraordinary event” that poses a serious public health risk.“We have also asked concerned agencies and officials to step up surveillance measures and send people suspected to have contracted the virus to the National Public Health Laboratory for the test,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director of the division. “We also held a discussion with the representative of the UN health body in Nepal and other officials concerned about the potential risk of the mpox virus spreading.”Monkeypox is a rare disease caused by infection with the monkeypox virus. It is the second time since the UN health body declared mpox a global health emergency in two years, as the virus has spread alarmingly in the African continents and is at risk of entering other continents. The WHO said that 524 people died and more than 14,000 cases of infection have been reported this year alone in Africa, which exceeded last year’s figure.The mpox virus is transmitted through close contact such as sex, skin-to-skin contact, and the respiratory tract or mucous membranes.Doctors say animal-to-human transmission often occurs through bites, scratches or direct contact with infected animals’ blood, body fluids or wounds. The virus causes flu-like symptoms.Nepal had confirmed mpox infection in June last year after a 60-year-old foreigner tested positive for monkeypox infection.Public health experts say that every disease seen in any corner of the world is possible to come to Nepal due to the high mobility of its own people and foreign tourists. They say it is relatively easier for people from any part of the globe to come to Nepal and that it increases the risk of any disease seen in any part of the globe arriving in Nepal.“We cannot keep repeating the same mistake. When Covid spread in China, we thought that since we did not have a direct flight from disease-hit areas, the chance of the disease spreading to Nepal was low, but this proved to be wrong,” said Dr Shrawan Kumar Mishra, director at the provincial Public Health Laboratory of Madhesh Province. “Many people from our country travel to Africa, and our UN peacekeepers also serve there and return home. Anyone coming back from disease-hit countries must be kept in isolation for three weeks.”Experts say screening at the health desks of international airports and land crossings alone is not enough to prevent a possible outbreak of monkeypox in the country since symptoms usually appear between five and 21 days after infection. Moreover, not everyone will have visible symptoms on their skin or limbs. They say that asymptomatic persons can also transmit the virus.Symptoms of the mpox virus include fever, headache, swelling, body pains, exhaustion, and itchy rashes on the face, hands, and feet.As the disease primarily spreads through close person-to-person contact, public health experts recommend self-isolation and good hygiene to avoid it. Doctors say that even though monkeypox infection is usually mild and most people recover within weeks, the authorities concerned should not underestimate the risks.Globally, more than 87,000 cases and 112 deaths from monkeypox were reported in 2022, according to the WHOThe UN health body said it is working with countries and vaccine manufacturers on potential vaccine donations and coordinating with partners through the interim Medical Countermeasures Network to facilitate equitable access to vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics and other tools. \nAmid a surge in new coronavirus cases in the country, the Ministry of Health and Population is preparing to roll out a Covid vaccine across the seven provinces.Officials said that elderly people, those with compromised immunity, and children between five and 11 years will be jabbed with the monovalent coronavirus vaccine supplied by the COVAX facility last month.“Most of the provincial health offices have already placed demands for the vaccine,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “We will start supplying vaccine doses to provinces within a week.”The monovalent or single component vaccine is designed for the Omicron sub-variant XBB.1.5 of SARS-CoV-2.Lately, Nepal has witnessed a rise in coronavirus cases. The World Health Organisation’s report on integrated influenza and other respiratory virus surveillance for week 31 of 2024 shows a SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate of 13.68 percent in Nepal. Also, the latest data from the National Public Health Laboratory indicates a sharp increase in cases. Of the 5,373 tests conducted since January, 341 came out positive for Covid. The test positivity rate is 6.3 percent, which is concerning, according to experts.Doctors say that the number of people suffering from fever, sore throat, body aches, and common cold has risen.The COVAX facility, the United Nations-backed international vaccine-sharing scheme, supplied Nepal with 1.6 million monovalent vaccine doses in the first week of July.Officials said that around 100,000 children with underlying conditions—cancer, HIV, and others will be administered the vaccine.Along with these children, pregnant women, people with compromised immunity, those with chronic diseases, and people over the age of 55 have been designated as vulnerable groups, officials said.Since the end of the second wave of Covid in 2021, health authorities across Nepal have stopped active case finding, including contact tracing and free testing. Hospitals now only conduct tests for those seeking polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for travel abroad or for seriously ill patients with respiratory conditions. Multiple doctors the Post spoke with said that the circulation of coronavirus has never stopped and is unlikely to stop in the near future.Infectious disease experts and virologists urge the public to take precautions to protect the elderly and people with comorbidities from the deadly virus. They warn that even if most people may not show severe symptoms from Covid infection, the elderly and people with underlying conditions remain at high risk.“We saw elderly people requiring intensive care during the previous surge in April,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “It’s time to return to the basics—washing hands, wearing face masks, avoiding crowds—to save at-risk groups like the elderly and those with underlying conditions.”Over 12,000 people died, and hundreds of thousands were infected in the first, second and third waves of the Covid pandemic.Meanwhile, the National Public Health Laboratory said that an Omicron sub-variant of the coronavirus is responsible for the surge in new infections of late. According to the latest update issued by the laboratory, the Omicron variant has been found in all 42 swab samples in the whole genome sequencing.Whole-genome sequencing is a comprehensive method of analysing the entire DNA sequence of an organism’s genes. Researchers believe this approach could be instrumental in tracking the virus’s severity and properties.This time, however, the laboratory has not provided information about the specific Omicron sub-variant. \nAs the spread of cholera continues unabated, agencies under the Ministry of Health and Population have started discussions to explore the possibility of vaccinating the people in affected areas against the deadly disease.Officials said that health authorities concerned and aid agencies held several rounds of discussions about containing the ongoing spread of the highly contagious disease.“We have also held discussion with the officials of the World Health Organisation in Nepal about the possibility of inoculating the people in the cholera hit areas including Lalitpur,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “We have also planned to discuss the issue with experts from the National Immunisation Advisory Committee.”Cholera is a highly infectious disease that causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting, leading to dehydration and even death within a few hours if untreated. The World Health Organisation says cholera is a global threat to public health and an indicator of inequality and a lack of social development.At least 50 people from four districts—38 in Lalitpur, eight in Kailali, and two each in Kathmandu and Pyuthan districts—have contracted cholera so far this year. Health officials said that the Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool samples of the infected patients.Public health experts said that detected cases of cholera infection could be just a tip of the iceberg, as most of the positive cases are being reported from the districts having active surveillance, including the three districts of the Kathmandu Valley and Kailali.Last year, health authorities administered an oral cholera vaccine in Kathmandu Metropolitan City’s wards 11, 12, and 13, which were highly affected by the outbreak. Vaccines against the deadly disease were administered in Kapilvastu and Rautahat districts in the past after all efforts to contain the spread of the disease failed.Health officials concede that even if they have discussed the issue of inoculating people from the disease hit areas with anti cholera vaccine, it is easier said than done. They said that finding an anti-cholera vaccine is challenging, as production of the vaccine itself is very low. Moreover, the government has not allocated a budget for the programme.“We have also talked with representatives of the Global Alliance for Vaccine and Immunisation (GAVI), which provides vaccines free of cost to Nepal,” Ghimire said. “But they told us that the chance of supplying vaccines in the near future is low. We have to prepare for cholera vaccination for next year.”Cholera outbreaks during the monsoon season are not a new thing in Nepal, as hundreds of people throughout the country suffer from diarrhoeal infections that continue for months every year and scores contract the disease.In 2022, a total of 77 cholera cases were confirmed in the Valley.Public health experts say that due to poor sanitation and hygiene conditions, the country as a whole is highly vulnerable to water-borne illnesses including diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid, hepatitis, and cholera, with thousands of people getting infected every year.They say sheer negligence from authorities concerned is responsible for ongoing outbreak of diarrhoeal diseases including the deadly cholera.Health authorities in most local units had stopped the testing of drinking water just before the start of the monsoon season, citing lack of funds, although deadly microbes such as faecal coliform and E coli were frequently detected in drinking water samples.Most of the water sources contaminated with deadly microbesOfficials at the Health Office, Lalitpur said that contamination of most of the sources of water—tap water, ground water, tanker water—is a main challenge to contain the spread of the cholera.“We have yet to check the quality of the jar water, which is widely used in offices, hotels and homes for drinking,” said Dr Bhuwan Paudel, chief of Health Office, Lalitpur. “But faecal coliform has been found in most of the samples of tap water, ground water and tanker water being used in Lalitpur.”Faecal coliform, a microscopic organism, is found in human faeces. According to doctors, the presence of faecal coliform in drinking water means it is contaminated with sewage.Doctors say bottled water, which is widely used by households and offices in Kathmandu Valley, is generally considered safe, but water quality of several companies have been found questionable. Dangerous microbes are detected in bottled water every year, which means not all jar water brands are safe to drink without treatment.They say consumption of contaminated water not only can cause diarrhoeal infections and deadly cholera but also increases the risk of contracting dysentery, typhoid, and hepatitis A and E.They stress that awareness drives and ensuring safe drinking water are crucial to protect people from water-borne diseases.A combination of careful surveys, provision of safe drinking water, good sanitation and hygiene standards, social mobilisation and treatment is required to contain the spread of infection, according to doctors.Doctors have asked authorities to launch awareness drives against water-borne diseases and ensure safe drinking water to prevent deaths from illnesses like cholera.To contain the spread of the infection, a combination of careful surveys, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation, and treatment is required, according to experts.The World Health Organisation has also said that a multifaceted approach is key to controlling cholera and reducing deaths. \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar. \nThe noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built. Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nSecond-half goals from Diogo Jota and Mohamed Salah allowed new Liverpool coach Arne Slot to get off to a 2-0 winning start at newly promoted Ipswich Town in the Premier League on Saturday.Ipswich, cheered on by new minority shareholder and singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran from the Portman Road stands, went toe-to-toe with Liverpool in the first half but failed to take their chances when they presented themselves.Slot’s new side improved markedly after the break, taking the lead on the hour mark through Jota before a fine move was finished off by Egyptian forward Salah five minutes later to effectively kill off the Ipswich challenge.Liverpool had a host of chances to make the result even more emphatic, but two goals were enough to navigate Liverpool and Slot past a tricky first game of the campaign.“Hopefully I keep going like this for the whole season,” Salah told TNT Sports. Coach Slot’s side clicked into gear after the break, however, carving open their opponents with two fine goals, the first finished off by Jota after a pinpoint Trent Alexander-Arnold pass set Salah free before he squared for the Portuguese.With Ipswich still regrouping, Salah, in his 350th appearance for the club in all competitions, netted superbly after being played in by Dominik Szoboszlai to seal the victory.Havertz and Saka fire Arsenal to opening win over WolvesArsenal eased to a 2-0 home win over Wolverhampton Wanderers as goals by Kai Havertz and Bukayo Saka got their Premier League title challenge up and running on Saturday.It was far from a fluent display in the summer sunshine but Mikel Arteta’s side, once again regarded as the team most likely to halt Manchester City’s domination, deserved the points.Havertz headed in from Saka’s cross in the 25th minute but the hosts never looked completely comfortable until Saka’s clinical finish doubled their advantage in the closing stages.Wolves had their chances with Rayan Ait-Nouri and Rodrigo Gomes both failing to trouble Arsenal keeper David Raya from promising positions when the score was 1-0.“I am really happy. With the first game you have some uncertainty in how you will respond,” Arteta said.Arsenal, runners-up to City for the past two seasons, dominated the opening period and took the lead when Saka was given too much time to pick out Havertz who directed his header into the corner to give keeper Jose Sa no chance.Carelessness set in for Arsenal, however, and Wolves came closest to an equaliser when Hwang Hee-chan's cross was met by Larsen with a header that Raya did well to keep out.Arsenal laboured after the break but the points were secured when Saka, Arsenal’s top league scorer last season and most dangerous player on Saturday, cut in from the right and buried a left-foot shot.“Saka is unbelievable. There are not a lot of players like him on the planet and he is still so young,” Havertz said. Dominant Brighton win 3-0 at 10-man EvertonDanny Welbeck scored one goal and set up another as Brighton & Hove Albion eased to a 3-0 victory at 10-man Everton on Saturday, in a perfect start for the Premier League’s youngest-ever permanent manager.Kaoru Mitoma scored at the back post after excellent work from debutant winger Yankuba Minteh, before Welbeck added a second and Simon Adingra a third to underline Brighton’s superiority.Right back Ashley Young was sent off midway through the second half as Everton’s final season at Goodison Park before they end their 132-year stay and move to a new stadium on the banks of the river Mersey got off to the worst possible start.“I thought it was a great performance, from the new manager, the fans and then onto the pitch,” Welbeck said.The visitors took the lead against the run of play when Minteh’s low cross was finished by Mitoma.The home side were awarded a penalty by referee Simon Hooper minutes into the second period when Lewis Dunk slid in on Dominic Calvert-Lewin in the box.But the decision was overturned after an intervention by Video Assistant Referee Darren England, who felt Calvert-Lewin had stood on the foot of the defender.Brighton doubled their advantage shortly afterwards as Idrissa Gueye gave the ball away in midfield and Welbeck was released to score from the edge of the box.The home side were reduced to 10 men midway through the second half when Mitoma got in behind 39-year-old Young, who held onto him, leaving Hooper with no option but to show the red card.Adingra took advantage of the extra space to score a third, while Yasin Ayari had the ball in the back of the net on his Brighton debut but was judged to be marginally offside.Joelinton secures victory for 10-man Newcastle over SouthamptonJoelinton’s goal earned Newcastle a 1-0 win over promoted Southampton in their first game of the Premier League season at St James’ Park on Saturday, despite going down to 10 men in the first half.Fabian Schar was sent off in the 28th minute for retaliating after a foul by Ben Brereton Diaz but the visitors failed to make the most of their numerical advantage, and Newcastle took the lead just before the break.Southampton keeper Alex McCarthy’s poor attempted pass to Jack Stephens was pounced on by Alexander Isak who played the ball across the box and Brazilian Joelinton took one touch before drilling his shot low into the corner of the net.“Southampton are a very good team. They made it difficult for us but I think we did well in the end,” Joelinton said.Southampton had the better of the second half as they piled on pressure in search of an equaliser, but Newcastle held on to take all three points.After Newcastle dominated the early stages, the visitors grew in confidence and had the ball in the net in the 10th minute but Jack Stephens was offside when he tapped in from close range.Southampton were boosted by Schar’s moment of madness after Brereton Diaz bundled him over from behind. The Swiss defender put his head against that of his opponent who went down rather theatrically and the referee pulled out the red card.It was Newcastle, however, who went in at the break a goal up after they took full advantage of McCarthy’s mistake when trying to play it out from the back.Five minutes after the interval Southampton’s Adam Armstrong had a close-range effort cleared off the line by Newcastle defender Lewis Hall, and the home side's keeper Nick Pope needed to be at his best to tip over another Armstrong shot. Semenyo salvages late draw for Bournemouth at ForestBournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo rescued a point for his side with a late equaliser as they drew 1-1 at Nottingham Forest in the Premier League on Saturday.Forest took the lead in the 23rd minute when defensive midfielder Ryan Yates’ close-range shot was parried by goalkeeper Neto and Chris Wood reacted quickly to slot the ball home.The hosts looked comfortable but Bournemouth equalised in the 86th minute when Semenyo smashed the ball in from close range.“I’m disappointed with how we conceded, we had the game under control. It was a tough game, a good game, both teams had momentum. We could have had more,” Forest manager Nuno Espirito Santo told the BBC.Dango Ouattara thought he had equalised for Bournemouth from a corner in the first half, but the goal was disallowed after the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) confirmed Lewis Cook was offside in the build-up.Forest had created a host of chances to double their lead but lacked quality in the final third. Morgan Gibbs-White looked lively and nearly put Forest ahead with a right-footed shot.Forest’s Brazilian midfielder Danilo was carried off on a stretcher 10 minutes into the game with what appeared to be a serious injury following a collision with Semenyo.Onana, Duran earn Villa 2-1 win at West HamAmadou Onana scored four minutes into his Aston Villa debut and Jhon Duran netted a late winner as Unai Emery’s men kicked off their Premier League season with a 2-1 victory at West Ham United on Saturday.The 22-year-old Onana, signed from Everton, leapt high to head home Youri Tielemans’ corner in the fourth minute, easily darting away from Michail Antonio to beat keeper Alphonse Areola from three yards out.“To come here and win is massive for us,” Tielemans said. “It gets us off to a good start. We can enjoy this win because it was a tough battle today.”Villa squandered several excellent chances before Lucas Paqueta drew the hosts level from the penalty spot in the 37th minute, the spot-kick awarded after a VAR check showed Matty Cash had fouled Tomas Soucek.Duran spoiled the home side’s evening, however, after Villa worked the ball down the left side and Jacob Ramsey's cross found Duran for a left-footed shot from the centre of the area through Areola's legs 11 minutes from time.Onana matched Kevin Phillips (2005) to become the joint earliest goalscorer for Villa on their league debut.Villa had a couple of excellent chances to double their lead earlier, first when Leon Bailey had Areola beaten before hitting the post from a tight angle and John McGinn’s shot rolled just wide.But Paqueta equalised soon after from the spot, the Brazilian beating keeper Emi Martinez with a stop-start run-up before calmly side-footing the ball into the bottom left corner.After Duran’s late goal, West Ham were close to equalising again seconds before the final whistle, but Soucek’s header was cleared off the line by Ezri Konsa. \nNepal will aim to win the trophy of the SAFF U-20 Championship for a third time when they begin their campaign of the biennial competition against Sri Lanka on Sunday.Nepal are drawn alongside Sri Lanka and Bangladesh in Group A. Group B consists of three-time champions and holders India, the Maldives and Bhutan.The group stage matches will be held at the ANFA Complex in Satdobato due to poor condition of Dasharath Stadium’s pitch. All Nepal Football Association had decided to move the group matches to Satdobato citing “unprepared pitch at the Dasharath Stadium”. The decision came after SAFF match commissioner Abdul Hameed Abdul Ghafoor, after an inspection, deemed the Dasharath Stadium unfit to host matches.The poor management of pitch of the country’s only international-standard football stadium drew public criticism on Tuesday when Japanese football icon Keisuke Honda’s Paro FC and Martyrs Memorial A-Division League champions Church Boys United played their AFC Challenge League qualification playoff match in a muddy and puddled pitch, following an afternoon rainfall.ANFA has said that the semi-finals and final will be held back at the Dasharath Stadium’s ground, which is undergoing renovation.Nepal coach Urjan Shrestha said he aims to keep the trophy at home.“We have prepared well. We played practice matches against A-Division League champions Church Boys United and Tribhuvan Army Club. We will take full advantage of the home ground and try to win the trophy,” said Shrestha.However, Nepal will face a tough challenge from their closest rivals India, who have dominated the competition for the last five years, winning the trophy for the third consecutive time [2019 (SAFF U-18), 2022 (SAFF U-20), 2023 (SAFF U-19)].Nepal won the first edition defeating India in the final in 2015 (SAFF U-19) at home and defended the title in 2017 (SAFF U-18) in Bhutan.Only Nepal and India have won the SAFF Championship since its inception.India coach Ranjan Chaudhary said they are also aiming to defend the title for a third straight edition.“We are the defending champions and will play the game likewise. But we are focused on our first match,” said Chaudhary, who will open their defense of the title against Bhutan on Monday.Three-time runners up Bangladesh will also aim to dislodge India’s stranglehold and win their first trophy. \nNepal has been selected as the host of the 2025 ICC U-19 Men’s Cricket World Cup Asia Qualifier, set to take place from April 12 to April 21, 2025.The Asia Qualifier is one of the five regional qualifier tournaments to determine the final five teams for the 2026 U-19 Men’s Cricket World Cup, with Africa Qualifier, European Qualifier, East-Asia Pacific Qualifier and Americas Qualifier being the other four competitions.One team from each (five) region will qualify for the main event.“Nepal has been selected as the host nation for the ICC U19 Men’s Cricket World Cup Asia Qualifier 2025,” the Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) said in a press release on Saturday. The Asia Qualifier will feature Nepal (hosts), Afghanistan, Hong Kong, Oman and the United Arab Emirates. The teams will vie for one spot in the 2026 U-19 Men’s Cricket World Cup. “This event marks a significant milestone for cricket in Nepal, and the nation looks forward to welcoming these teams and showcasing its passion for the sport on an international stage,” the cricket governing body added.With home support, Nepal will look to qualify for the World Cup for a consecutive time after featuring in the 2024 ICC U-19 Men’s Cricket World Cup in South Africa. Nepal had topped the six-team table remaining unbeaten to secure their ticket to the 2024 World Cup—their first World Cup in eight years.In South Africa, Nepal had pulled off a thrilling one-wicket victory over Test member Afghanistan in the group stage to progress to the Super Six. The 2026 World Cup will be co-hosted by Zimbabwe and Namibia. \nA late goal by new signing Joshua Zirkzee earned Manchester United a nervy 1-0 victory over Fulham in their Premier League season opener at Old Trafford on Friday.Home supporters were in buoyant mood ahead of the first game of the English top-flight campaign, with four players unveiled on the pitch and new faces in the United boardroom also in attendance.Just as they did at home for much of last season, however, United struggled to break down their opponents in the first half, with captain Bruno Fernandes going closest to scoring the opener.Frustrations grew after the break, only for Dutch substitute Zirkzee to arrive right on cue three minutes from time to earn United victory.“To win here in my first home game and to grab a goal, it couldn’t be better,” Zirkzee told Sky Sports.“Manchester United is a huge club. You should always strive for the best. It's all good vibes.”A smart save from goalkeeper Andre Onana kept an early curling Kenny Tete effort out while Fernandes was presented with two golden opportunities but was denied by Fulham keeper Bernd Leno.Midfielder Mason Mount handed a starting spot after an injury-ravaged first season in Manchester, went close early in the second half.More wayward passing led to groans from supporters, however, before despair turned to jubilation at the death when substitutes Alejandro Garnacho and Zirkzee combined to create the winner.United have more wins and more points from their opening games of Premier League campaigns than any other team, but this performance suggested there is still much to be done for manager Erik ten Hag.Without a Premier League title since 2013 and having addressed key problem areas in the transfer market, United supporters are expecting better than their eighth-placed finish last term. \nAt least 17 Palestinians were killed and dozens wounded in an Israeli strike in the central Gaza town of Zawayda on Saturday, health officials said, as Israel issued new evacuation orders, citing Hamas rocket fire nearby.Israel also announced the names of two soldiers Israeli media reported were killed on Saturday afternoon when a roadside bomb exploded in the central Gaza Strip, and an air strike in the occupied West Bank that it said killed two senior Hamas militants involved in the killing of an Israeli.The violence occurred before US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was expected to land in Israel on Sunday and meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday, amid stepped-up diplomatic efforts to conclude a deal to end the fighting between Israel and the militant Islamist group and free Israeli hostages.Most of the people killed in Zawayda were from the same family and they included eight children and four women, according to health officials in the Hamas-administered enclave.“They were asleep in their beds, kids and babies, then three missiles targeted their place,” said Abu Ahmed Hassan, a neighbour. The owner of the house was a known merchant, he said. “There are no military activities here at all,” he added.The Israeli military said in response it had struck militant targets in an area from which rockets were fired at its troops. It said the incident was under review.Israel’s military spokesperson posted instructions in Arabic on X on Saturday for people in parts of central Gaza, including in the Maghazi district near Zawayda, to evacuate to a designated humanitarian zone.Reuters could not immediately verify whether Zawayda was among the places ordered to evacuate and whether people there had received the military’s instructions. Residents said thousands were streaming out of Maghazi.On Friday, two sections of the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis within what Israel has designated as a humanitarian zone were deemed dangerous by the military, which ordered people to evacuate them, saying militants had been regularly firing rockets from there.The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said Friday’s orders, which also included other areas of the enclave outside the humanitarian zones, had affected around 170,000 displaced people.“This is one of the largest evacuation orders affecting the zone to date and it shrinks the size of the so-called ‘humanitarian area’ to about 41 square kilometres, or 11 per cent of the total area of the Gaza Strip,” an OCHA report said.In the central part of the enclave, residents said Israeli tanks advanced further on Saturday into the eastern area of Deir al-Balah, an area they had not entered before, where hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians are sheltering.The Israeli military said that since Friday its forces had killed dozens of militants, including some who had fired rockets from central and southern Gaza.Most of Gaza’s 2.3 million population has been displaced by the 10-month-old Israeli offensive, which has laid waste to much of the enclave.Another Israeli airstrike on a car in the occupied West Bank city of Jenin on Saturday killed at least two more Palestinians, one an 18-year-old, the Palestinian health ministry said.CEASEFIRE TALKSGaza ceasefire talks in Doha, mediated by the US, Qatar and Egypt, were due to resume next week.A statement from Netanyahu’s office said Israel’s negotiating team had expressed “cautious optimism” on the possibility of advancing a deal “in accordance with the updated American proposal (based on the May 27th framework), including components acceptable to Israel.”US President Joe Biden said on Friday, following two days of talks in Doha, that efforts to reach a deal were now in sight, although he warned that negotiations were “far from over”.Hamas spokesman Jihad Taha told Al Jazeera TV on Saturday that Israel had added conditions in the ceasefire talks and accused Netanyahu of using these to hinder the efforts.Asked about Blinken’s visit to the region, he said the group did not rely on the US as it has been biased towards Israel.Another Hamas official, Osama Hamdan, told Al Jazeera that Israel wanted the right to return to the fight even if a prisoner exchange was agreed. “They want to have the right to attack Gaza whenever they want,” he said.The war was triggered on Oct. 7 when Hamas attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.Israel’s subsequent military campaign has killed more than 40,000 Palestinians, most of them civilians, according to Gaza health authorities. Israel has lost more than 330 soldiers in Gaza since its ground operations there began after Oct. 7, and says at least a third of the Palestinian dead are fighters. \nIndian medical professionals started a 24-hour shutdown of non-emergency services across the country on Saturday in protest against the brutal rape and murder of a doctor in the eastern city of Kolkata.The shutdown, which began at 6 am, will cut off access to elective medical procedures and out-patient consultations in the world’s most populous nation, according to a statement by the Indian Medical Association.Casualty departments at hospitals, which deal with emergencies, will continue to be staffed.A 31-year-old trainee doctor was raped and murdered last week inside a medical college in Kolkata where she worked, triggering nationwide protests among doctors and drawing parallels to the notorious gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old student on a moving bus in New Delhi in 2012.Anger at the failure of tough laws to deter a rising tide of violence against women has fuelled protests by doctors and women’s groups.“Women form the majority of our profession in this country. Time and again, we have asked for safety for them,” IMA President R. V. Asokan told Reuters on Friday.More than a million medics were expected to join the strike. \nDucking as mortar fire exploded around them, Rohingya refugee Mustafa Kamal and his family narrowly escaped the attack by a rebel militia on their town in western Myanmar.Crowds had gathered on a small island to seek shelter after witnessing killings in the coastal town of Maungdaw, he said, but “many died on the spot”, including one of his nephews, Noor Sadek.Others crawled and swam to reach neighbouring Bangladesh, he said.His family are among many Rohingya, members of a persecuted mostly Muslim minority, who fled Myanmar’s Rakhine state in recent days, as fighting escalates between the troops of the ruling junta and the Arakan Army, the powerful ethnic militia that recruits from the Buddhist majority.Reuters was not able to determine how many Rohingya had crossed into Bangladesh, where close to a million Rohingya live in refugee camps outside the coastal town of Cox’s Bazar.But medical charity Medicines Sans Frontières said its doctors had treated 54 people for violence-related injuries in recent days, 40 per cent of them women and children.“We were seeing lots of gunshots, shrapnel, mortar shell injuries, all indicative of indiscriminate,” Orla Murphy, the group’s Bangladesh representative, told Reuters. “They were life-threatening trauma wounds that we were treating.”The influx of refugees, who will have to stay with relatives, stretching resources, will make food supplies scarce, said the representative of a panel of displaced Rohingya.“They are suffering from an extreme food crisis,” added Kamal Hossain, chairman of the panel. “The government and camp authorities should arrange their food.”Many dozens of Rohingya, including a heavily pregnant woman and her two-year-old daughter, were killed last week in drone attacks in Maungdaw that three witnesses said were carried out by the Arakan Army, Reuters reported.The rebel group and the junta blamed one another for the attack. Several boats carrying refugees to Bangladesh were sunk, killing more, Bangladesh media said.The latest wave of attacks, including the burning of a Rohingya town by the Arakan Army in May, is the biggest surge in violence against the Rohingya since a 2017 Myanmar military-led campaign that the United Nations said was carried out with genocidal intent forced more than 730,000 to flee to Bangladesh.‘FIGHTING FOR LIFE’Mohammed Mizanur Rahman, a Bangladesh refugee relief official based in Cox’s Bazar, said Rohingya had been seeking safety in increased numbers since the drone attack but did not say how many had crossed the border.“I have heard that many dead bodies are floating across to Bangladesh and a humanitarian crisis has occurred across the shore in Maungdaw,” he said.Bangladesh is in no position to accept more Rohingya refugees from Myanmar, the South Asian nation’s de-facto foreign minister, Mohammad Touhid Hossain, told Reuters on Thursday, asking neighbouring India and other countries to do more.Hossain also called for more international pressure on the Arakan Army to stop the attacks on the Rohingya in Rakhine state.“But when someone arrives with a bullet injury, fighting for life, or a pregnant woman arrives fighting for life, we are not that inhuman that we will turn them away,” Bangladesh’s Rahman said.The United Nations refugee agency, the UNHCR, said it did not have information on the number of Rohingya who had crossed into Bangladesh.Another man who fled his home with his young family, Mohammed Saber, said about 60 people were killed in his village when the Arakan Army raided it, among them his two-year-old nephew, Mujibul Hasan.They paid traffickers to take them by boat to Bangladesh but the ship came under attack, which killed dozens aboard, he said.The family is now sheltering with an uncle, but Saber has no money. He needs to buy medicine for his children.“I will do whatever it takes to keep my family alive,” he said. \nWhat animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. \nNepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) \nAnother August 14 has passed by with familiar proclamations about the evil designs of the proverbial ‘foreign hand’. As usual, outside conspirators are complemented by enemies inside our own borders. The list is long and comprised of absurdly opposed actors like retired spy chiefs and a women-led Baloch peace movement. Blanket categories like ‘digital terrorism’ are devised.The now months-old ban on social media sites like X has been extended with the operationalisation of a long-touted digital security system (also known as a firewall). Leaving aside for a while the absurd notion that all of this makes us safer, let us focus on the economic fallout that has been triggered.Pakistan is reportedly the fourth biggest gig economy in the world, with millions of (mostly young) people generating incomes through a host of digital platforms. There can be no romanticising the realities of pla­t­form capitalism; it is exploitative, has my­r­iad gendered effects and is cause and consequence of the unprecedented com­m­o­­d­i­f­i­c­a­tion of social life. Yet beggars can’t be choosers in a country where land grabbing, khaki real estate schemes, hoarding, contraband trade, useless mega infrast­ructure projects and the like represent the dominant model of ‘economic development’.Unlike most variants of Pakistani capitalism, the gig economy’s one saving grace is that it generates some employment opportunities for young, educated segments of the population, thus offsetting some of the demographic pressure that is culminating, with almost two million people joining the labour force annually.We have been here before. Temporary bans on YouTube, TikTok and other big social media sites have suffocated the livelihoods of those who have had more or less success monetising their content. Increasingly regular moves to suspend mobile data have badly affected precarious workers reliant on food delivery, ride-sharing and many other apps.The current internet clampdown is affe­c­ting all this as well as call centres, software developers, digital marketing and many other sub-sectors. Even basic commu­nications apps like WhatsApp have been crippled. A number of foreign companies—most prominently Fiverr—have suggested they will soon shift their operations away from Pakistan because their daily losses run into the millions. I care less abo­ut the profits of multinationals than I do about the call centre workers who are being deprived of even their meagre daily wages.The latest hybrid regime started off exhorting the need for foreign investment, and has now succeeded in thwarting its own stated imperative. In 2022, digital freelancers brought in $500 million, which is at least as much concrete currency than we’ve actually see come into the country through the much-touted SIFC.Our khaki-dominated ruling class is so consumed by palace intrigues and the windfall profits of big office that it is unable to see where it is taking what is already a sinking ship. When X and WhatsApp are dee­med threats to ‘national security’ because urban middle class types from military and civilian backgrounds—previously the biggest defenders of the established order—are now using these platforms to criticise the inc­umbent regime, it is obvious that the est­ablishment and its lackeys have lost the plot.It is unsurprising that the powers are petrified by youth-led movements in the peripheries, including the women-led Baloch Yekjheti Committee. Such movements are anti-establishment, and represent a threat to all warring ruling class factions. But here too even a slightly competent ruling class with an eye for the future would realise the clamping down on social media to suppress the group’s reach is a double-edged sword because digital freelancing helps incorporate at least some young disaffected Baloch (as well as Pakhtun, Sindhi, Gilgit-Baltistani, Kashmiri, Seraiki) youth into the system.But there is little competence here, only gimmicks like ‘Digital Pakistan’. Meanwhile young working people in the once-loyal Punjabi heartland are seeing their fragile middle class aspirations go up in smoke, which is, in turn, generating even more disaffection as evidenced not only through political opinions in digital spaces but also in the realms of art and culture. All of this can certainly be suppressed, but the economic pressure cooker cannot bubble over indefinitely.Let me be clear: the decision to suffocate the digital economy mostly affects white-collar youth. The vast majority of our blue-collar working population has no outlet whatsoever, other than menial jobs and emigration by any means necessary. But they could care less, so we should expect more of the same to come. Without a meaningful, countrywide alternative to the game of the thrones, we will all be reduced to freelancers for ruin.-Dawn (Pakistan)/ANN \nOne of the first group experiments of Nepal Studies in the mid-20th century came in the form of a research collective which was later named Samsodhan Mandal. It was founded and led by the late Naya Raj Pant (1913-2002). Pant had studied Siddhant Jyautisa (astronomy) with Padmakar Dvivedi and others in Banaras for about six years during the 1930s. A key text that had greatly influenced him during this period was Bhaskara’s Siddhantasiromani, a 12th-century text. Dvivedi was interested in ancient history and tried to inculcate that interest in his pupils as well. According to Pant, he used to meet with his guru outside of school hours to learn history and other things. From the mid-1930s, Pant started studying the history of Nepal. After returning to Kathmandu in 1938, he came into contact with Baburam Acharya (1888-1972) who gave him old documents to study. Later he came into contact with Sardar Rudra Raj Pandey (1901-1987) who facilitated a six-month research stint for him in the Guthi Office.Pant writes, “From all these [interests and connections], I learnt a bit about Nepali history. When I found mutually contradictory statements [stories] in the history written by foreigners, I began to lose my respect for them. I [then] decided to progressively revise the history of Nepal.” In 1941, Pant was hired by the Ranipokhari Sanskrit Pathashala to teach Jyautisa. From around the same time, he is said to have immersed himself in the further study of Sanskrit grammar and Kautilya’s Arthasastra. Starting from the early 1940s, Pant started a private Pathashala in Kathmandu to train students in Sanskrit, Jyautisa and history. What was his vision then? In Hamro Uddesya ra Karyapranali, a text said to have been written around 1957 but published only in 2002, Pant wrote, “A century has passed since we started taking English-style education. We know first-hand that we have been (mostly) unable to learn work-effective knowledge, or when we have managed to do so, it has not succeeded in our country and produced good results. Now is not the time to remain idle. There is no other way but to rejuvenate our own ancient knowledge. Even though it might require great perseverance and a lot of time, we have to do research on our knowledge and advance it further; we have to maintain our own traditional experiences, and find our own path/method. Only if we manage to do this will we be independently able to make our country more prosperous....It is with this belief that we are engaged in studying-teaching Sanskrit education to rejuvenate our knowledge. The Sanskrit Pathashala has been opened for this purpose.”Just as one founder of the Nepal Sanskritik Parisad (estd 1951) had highlighted the need to cultivate self-identity to shed the cultural dependency on Europe, Pant stressed the need to rejuvenate traditional Sanskrit education as the highway for Nepal’s prosperity. Regarding the particular modality of his Pathashala, in an article published in 2014, historian Yogesh Raj has suggested that Pant had been “impressed by the strict Gurukul-style teachings of an obscure Pandit Genalal Chaudhary” whom he had encountered in Banaras.Pant’s Pathashala adhered to some fundamentals as integral to the process of training as a historian. These included mastery of Sanskrit, palaeography and epigraphy, rote memorisation of some key texts, and rectification of factual errors committed by other historians based on source criticism. When enrolling at the Pathashala, the students had to pledge that they would not use it as a ladder to subsequent education in foreign languages. The guardians of the students also had to sign another piece of paper saying, “From the bottom of my heart, I believe that great knowledge can be attained and livelihood earned even when one does not study English or other foreign languages.”In Pant’s Pathashala, mastery over Sanskrit was given great priority. In the words of his son and disciple Mahes Raj Pant, this enabled the students “to have independent access to many a discipline from the whole range of Sanskrit literature.” Rote learning as part of the ‘traditional method’ was a fundamental tenet of the senior Pant’s training while he was a student, and he replicated this method in his own Pathashala. Recitation of specific texts from memory was how gradual competence was demonstrated in this school. Being able to critically edit old documents and texts of inscriptions and write commentaries on them was another part of the training. The projected time-period to master the skills emphasised in this school was a total of eight years.Following the guru’s command, the students in Pant’s Pathashala mostly invested their academic energies into doing research on the history of Nepal. This work began to thrive after the Rana regime ended in 1951. Its members started to publish pamphlets of Itihas-samsodhan (Amendments of History) from 1952. In the words of Mahes Raj Pant, “In those pamphlets the students pointed out with documentary evidence the errors committed by the so-called scholars in dealing with the history of Nepal. That work of the group attracted a lot of popular attention at the time. Some of the Ithihasa-Samsodhana pamphlets contained harsh words to shock those who were incompetent to write the history of Nepal….The task of the group helped to highlight various aspects of Nepalese history and gave a fresh impetus to the reconstruction of a correct and complete history of Nepal.” In these pamphlets, Mandal students deployed what Raj has called “multi-layer source criticism.” Their “rule of evidence” was “primarily about sustained engagement with the fidelity of evidence and often solely that.” At its largest, the Mandal’s Pathashala had 32 students out of which 21 were involved in the history samsodhan work. However, by the time the Samsodhan Mandal got officially registered in the early 1960s, only ten, including the guru, remained. One member of the group, Gyanmani Nepal (1933-2024), had already graduated by then and returned to his home in eastern Nepal to start a similar Pathashala. Several others had quit the group for various reasons.By the end of the 1960s, the Mandal’s scholars had generated a corpus of booklets including several dozen ‘Amendments of History’. A consolidated and revised collection of 50 such ‘Amendments’ was published in 1962. They had also published a series of Shavadhan-patras, challenging the published work of various scholars and cautioning them against unethical academic practices such as not acknowledging the published work of the Mandal scholars. They had also published several volumes of primary documents, including 12 issues of the quarterly Abhilekh-sangraha, some critically edited historical texts, and over 20 issues of its quarterly journal Purnima (estd 1964). By 1970, the Pathashala had trained individuals such as Dhanavajra Vajracharya (1932-1994), Gyanmani Nepal, the late Shankar Man Rajbanshi, Gautamvajra Vajracharya, Mahes Raj Pant, and several others as historians. Several members of this Pathashala went on to make significant contributions in history-writing of Nepal. They provided us with a relatively secure knowledge of the chronology of the successive ruling dynasties of Nepal from the Licchavi period to the Shah dynasty, made public various types of new historical documents and other sources and set exacting standards for evidence-based history-writing. The main bulk of their contributions fell under the domain of political history, but some of them also made significant contributions to a broader social history. Articles in the essay form and length were the preferred outputs of the members of this school, and interpretive historical narrative of the monograph length was not their strongest mode of written output. Writing in 1984, one of Mandal’s members, Mahes Raj Pant, stated, “The greatest contribution of this group was that it inspired the natives with the idea that given proper education, we can carry on research, and we ourselves are competent enough to reconstruct our past.” In the assessment of Yogesh Raj, the work of the Mandal contributed to “epistemic diversity” in historical knowledge production in post-Rana Nepal. Raj adds, “Mandal scholars took evidence as resources whose rigorous criticism would lead to a true and ‘scientific’ knowledge about the past.” Samsodhan Mandal’s Pathashala was plagued by financial problems from its very beginning. After an initial phase of great activity in the 1950s and 60s, it could not find the means to retain its students and reproduce itself in intergenerational terms. By the time of the death of its initiator, Naya Raj Pant, in November 2002, the school had been reduced to the guru and his two historian sons, Mahes Raj and Dines Raj Pant. While talking to a journalist in the immediate aftermath of the demise of the senior Pant, his two sons described their father’s attempt at an alternative to formal university-based education and degrees as a “failure”. The senior Pant and his sons have often said that, among other reasons, the antagonism of those whose work had been amended by the Mandal’s students led to the downfall of its Pathashala. In their view, given that those who were ‘attacked’ in its pamphlets were powerful members of Nepal’s intellectual elite, the latter conspired to disband the Pathashala. While there is no doubt that those whose works were ‘amended’ were mostly not pleased to have been put under the Mandal’s scanner, the idea of them getting together to conspire against the Pathashala’s institutional longevity is a bit hard to digest. The Pathashala initially succeeded because the pupils mostly adhered to the utopian visions of the guru Naya Raj Pant and participated in his experiment as his disciples. However, as they gradually became expert historians in their own right and had to earn a living to support their families, discordance between the fiscal needs of the pupils and the school’s inability to generate an income to keep it running became all too apparent. The school never had a system whereby the pupils were expected to pay regular fees to take lessons. In the early decades, the guru supported his family with his salary from the Ranipokhari Sanskrit Pathashala, and its scholars occasionally got some stipend from various sources (including Nepal Sanskritik Parisad) to critically edit historical texts. As part of their remit as trainees, the older students also tutored the younger ones in the Pathashala. Following the establishment of Tribhuvan University in 1959, university-credentialed individuals began to find jobs in new state, para-state and private institutions. By the early 1970s, the intergenerational transfer of knowledge began to be mediated by more complex institutions supported by the state and market forces. Hence, the Mandal’s Pathashala model and the vision of which it was a part, began to look less attractive to those who were already its members and to younger folks who were its potential members. When the late Dhanavajra Vajracharya, one of the Mandal’s most competent and committed members, quit it and joined TU in 1971, the attraction of this Pathashala was surely on the decline.  In the context of the immediate post-Rana Nepal, the experiment that was Samsodhan Mandal Pathashala was important because it established a firm tradition of Nepali historical scholarship based on a critical reading of the evidence. This school demonstrated what could be achieved through a commitment to a kind of historical scholarship that had been in practice in scholarly traditions in different parts of the world until the mid-20th century but mostly absent in Nepal. We should also note that the Pathashala was a home-grown effort that relied on the collaboration of several individuals for its success and for at least a few decades, its work provided one model of how Nepal Studies could be done in Nepal.  \nEighteen years after the decade-long Maoist insurgency (1996-2006) ended, there is finally some hope of justice for the victims. On Wednesday, the House of Representatives endorsed the bill to amend the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act 2014. (The bill has yet to pass the National Assembly and the President’s authentication, which will take some time.) This long-overdue amendment has also brought a much-needed relief for everyone who advocated for justice and reparation for those affected. The latest step will pave the way for completing the pending tasks of seeking truths about insurgency-era cases of violence and possible closures.Some provisions in the TRC Act called for amnesty to perpetrators of serious human rights violations. Several governments have been formed and toppled since the Supreme Court in 2015 directed the authorities to make necessary revisions to the Act. Years went by with no urgent actions, and justice remained a pipedream. Only recently did the leading parties—Nepali Congress, CPN-UML and Maoist Centre—heed the bill introduced by the former premier and Maoist chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal last year. Even though the bill has received a positive response from many quarters, including diplomats and heads of international organisations closely watching Nepal’s peace process, some human rights activists and victims are still concerned about some provisions in the bill. It categorises rape or serious cases of sexual violence, enforced disappearances and intentional killings as non-amnestiable, which is a sensible provision. But it allows for amnesty in other human rights violations cases and allows for reducing the sentence by up to 75 percent if perpetrators fulfil some set criteria except in rape or serious sexual violence cases, leaving space for manipulation. The bill also omits the issue of child soldiers used during the insurgency, and this is a serious concern. Given such flaws, there are genuine concerns as to whether the leaders are simply trying to end the chapter with minimal changes. That the major parties have come together to conclude this long-pending issue is laudable, but they shouldn’t use the bill to appease political factions or collect brownie points. The three leading party chairs—Sher Bahadur Deuba, KP Sharma Oli and Pushpa Kamal Dahal—marked the endorsement as a matter of national pride. Dahal, the chief architect of the insurgency, said he hoped it would “lead the country towards the conclusion of the peace process.” The first step the leaders should take is to work towards appointing officials to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission of the Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons, both of which have been left in limbo for over two years. The next step is to heed the concerns and disagreements of the stakeholders of the peace process and resolve them. The TRC dream will translate into reality only with an unwavering commitment to ensuring a just and respectful environment for the victims. It remains to be seen if the law will be implemented as promised and hoped. If not, it will betray the very principles of justice and reparation upon which Nepal’s peace process was founded.  \nWith the Paris 2024 Olympics concluding earlier this week, Nepali players have returned home. All seven athletes returned empty handed, having failed to break the 60-year spell of participating in Olympics without winning a medal. Those scratching their heads as to why Nepal has had a dry run all these decades needn’t look further than the Dasharath Stadium, located at the nerve centre of Kathmandu. The country’s most famous stadium was a sight to see on Tuesday. Nepal’s Church Boys United lost to Bhutan’s Paro FC, which was a shock for Nepali fans. But the match result was hardly a topic of discussion on Tuesday evening. Rather, it was the ground of the country’s only international-standard stadium hosting an international match. It was a messy affair on the ground as the 22 boys jostled for the ball, slipping on the puddled, muddy ground all the time. As the Nepali players struggled to clinch a win against the visiting team, the photographs circulating on social and mainstream media, of the players drenched in sludge, gave an early indication that Nepal was set to lose an image war internationally. The Japanese football icon Keisuke Honda, a member of the Bhutan squad, was right on point when he called the Bhadrakali ground a joke. It’s not clear whether Nepali authorities have taken Honda’s remark as an insult to Nepal or ignored it completely, but Honda, who has played three world cups for Japan, should be thanked for pointing out our pathetic state. The tamasha at the stadium exposed the state of our sports infrastructure and the insincerity of our authorities even when it comes to organising an international event.Alarmingly, the situation is no different in cricket, volleyball or martial arts. Nepali youths have tremendous interest and potential in sports, in addition to a fan base envied by the world. Impressed by our young talents, the international sports fraternity has shown unprecedented interest towards Nepal in recent years. But the authorities remain as lethargic as ever even to cash in on the international goodwill.There is no dearth of literature on the lackadaisical attitude of Nepali sports authorities. But there are some basics they should do immediately if Nepali sports is to get any better. First, the authorities must work to strengthen the financial security of the players. Only then we can expect better results from them. If the sportspeople are playing for the country, it is the country that should look after their needs. The prime ministers, ministers and other officials who compete to make big announcements after a Nepali team’s win in an international match should learn to walk the talk.Second, the authorities should work immediately to improve sports infrastructure. If the Dasharath Stadium is muddy, the Kirtipur Cricket Ground has no light. The Mulpani Cricket Stadium has taken decades to complete, and there are hardly any decent stadiums outside the capital city, and players are deprived of training and international exposure. The authorities must therefore ensure that the sports bodies strictly follow a calendar of events throughout the year from federal to the grassroots level to ensure a holistic development of the sector. If we continue to make the players dodge the sludge on their training ground, we cannot expect them to return home with international medals.  \nIndia’s new foreign secretary Vikram Misri returned to New Delhi on Monday after a 32-hour whirlwind tour around Kathmandu. Not much was expected of the visit, as it was supposed to be a courtesy call, a continuation of the tradition of Indian foreign secretaries visiting neighbouring countries after their appointment. So there were no significant breakthroughs in outstanding issues—just an exchange of pleasantries and congratulations over chiya-kaffee. A rendezvous with no agenda is a good thing once in a while—after all, neighbours can’t just engage in geopolitical hard talk all the time. However, here’s wishing the visiting dignitary had some time to step out of the prime ministerial and presidential chambers onto the streets. For the monsoon-battered, puddled roads reflect reality better than the glossy floors of Baluwatar and Sheetal Niwas. Having recently seen a diplomatic whodunnit in Bangladesh, Indian Babus would certainly want to touch base with ground reality in the neighbourhood.Nepal and Bangladesh have different political contexts, including in terms of parliamentary politics. Having faced Sheikh Hasina's seemingly tight grip on state affairs for over a decade and a half, Bangladeshis were fidgeting for a change as democracy was on the wane. With 13 government changes in 16 years, Nepal remains committed to democracy although Nepalis are looking for a change, seeking stability. India remained tight-lipped on the goings-on in Bangladesh even as Hasina sought a fourth consecutive term this January by keeping opposition leaders behind bars. Apart from being the biggest trade partner in South Asia, Bangladesh was a “friendly” nation to India, thanks to Hasina’s indebtedness to India from 1971 all the way to 2024. As long as the person of its liking was in power in Dhaka, India chose to remain silent to the calls for democracy, free press and fair elections in Bangladesh, only to jolt back to reality when the tide of change swept Hasina off her feet, and the comfort of dealing with a friendly ruler in the neighbourhood became a thing of the past.Luckily for Misri, things are not too bad in Nepal. But when was the last time a top Indian diplomat spoke about the report of the Eminent Persons Group that is collecting dust due to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s reluctance to so much as acknowledge it? When will India acknowledge Bhairahawa Airport as Nepal’s major development infrastructure and provide the air space for it to operate fully? And when will the Babus in New Delhi’s North Block stop using the language of Nepal, a supposed backyard of India, being taken over by China? When Misri returns to Nepal for a definitive diplomatic visit, he would want to come up with some fresh ideas and spend a bit more time to understand the subterranean tides of change. Nepal might have been ruled by old leaders milking their legacy of the 1990s politics when Misri was still a young foreign services officer in India, but the old Indian lenses used to look at Nepal now need replacing.  \nIt’s not a good sign for people to start questioning a government’s anti-corruption credentials barely a month after its formation. Yet they have choice but to do so with the government seemingly intent on giving a free pass to many corrupt officials and leaders. As per a bill currently under discussion in the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee of Parliament, a corruption case should be filed within five years of the knowledge of such an instance of corruption. (It is unclear who should have such knowledge.) Similarly, if an individual had been involved in corruption while being in a public position and could not be punished at the time, they too should be punished within five years of retirement. In fact, the bill was first registered by the then KP Sharma Oli government on January 20, 2020. It was passed and sent to Parliament on April 10, 2023. With Oli back in power, the bill, which is supposed to amend the Prevention of Corruption Act, 2059 (2002 AD) has now again come to the centrestage. The bill presented by the Oli government seems to have been inspired by a “forgive and forget” approach to corruption. It is so indefensible that even the MPs from the ruling parties are struggling to do it. Lawmakers of the opposition Maoist Centre and Rastriya Swatantra Party have also rightly pointed out that the deadline of five years is regressive. As it stands, the UML is the sole party in defense of the bill. If the other parties, both ruling and opposition, stick to their guns, the government will have to back down, and it should. For there is absolutely no rhyme or reason for the five-year cap; and were such a cap to be imposed, countless current and former politicians and bureaucrats who are soaked in corruption would walk scot-free. Nepal already ranks an alarming 108 of the 180 countries on Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index (CPI) 2023—below fellow South Asian countries Bhutan (26th), the Maldives (93rd) and India (93rd). Moreover, the conviction rate in corruption cases in 2021-22 stood at just 38.5 percent. If there is one thing the government should do at this time, it is to bring policies to reduce corruption and punish the corrupt with due diligence. However, it seems to want to take the opposite route.From instances of money laundering to land grabbing, selling diplomatic passports to turning citizens into refugees, corruption is widespread in Nepal. No political party is free from corruption, which is also exemplified by recent investigations into high-level politicians in the Lalita Niwas land grab scam, the gold smuggling scams, and the Bhutanese refugee scam. There is ample evidence of how no corrupt country can steadily move forward on the path of peace and prosperity. This is why, fighting corruption should be the top agenda of all big and small political parties that purport to work in national interest. Those who don’t do so deserve to be singled out and punished for doing irreparable harm to their country.  \nThe CPN (Maoist Centre) has either led or been a part of the government for most of the past decade and half. But the most recent Maoist Centre-led government under Pushpa Kamal Dahal was ousted only last month. Following this, the party’s senior leaders are in marathon meetings. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asked Giriraj Mani Pokharel, the Maoist Centre deputy general secretary, on the party’s review of the turn of events and its future strategy. The Maoist Centre is now out of the government. How does the party intend to go forward? We have started a series of party meetings to review the overall situation and to set the party’s agenda. We held a meeting of the office bearers that ran for five days. Now the party’s standing committee meeting is underway. After this, there will be a central committee meeting. That will take the final decisions on the party’s strategy and programmes for the coming days. In the meetings, the party chair has asked the leaders to discuss national as well as party issues frankly and honestly. At the end of the meeting, we will make an objective analysis of the overall situation and prepare an action plan.The Central Committee endorses the decisions. But the meetings of the office bearers and standing committee set the agenda and orientation for the party. What have you decided so far? On the national front, obviously, the dissolution of our government and formation of a new alliance is an issue. Leaders of the new coalition have said their alliance is for making changes in the constitution. They however are still not transparent. Based on their statements, it can be said that they are going against their own pledges. During the election campaign, they had said nothing about changing the constitution. You don’t find it in their manifestos as well. But in the middle of this five-year tenure, they have come up with a new agenda. A question arises: Can they change the constitution? Doesn’t that violate the mandate the parties got through the elections? Generally, the constitution might be reviewed after 10 years of its implementation. But we haven’t implemented it in a full-fledged way as we don’t even have all the laws required for its effective implementation. We have just agreed to conclude the remaining tasks of the peace process. So, the proposal to amend the constitution without first completing the basics required for its implementation is wrong. They want to make changes in the proportional inclusive system of our constitution. A political force can work to secure a majority in the House through general elections and ensure stability in the country. We accept that. We have also been lobbying for a directly elected executive president for political stability. They are not ready to debate on that. But they want to revoke the inclusive system, a major achievement of the 2006 people’s movement. This system has empowered historically excluded and deprived communities. We have to enhance the capacity of these groups instead of depriving them of their rights. If there are anomalies in the system’s implementation, let’s develop methods to more effectively pick our representatives. But the ruling parties seem intent on turning back the clock. Some leaders have publicly announced that they want to end the role of small parties. There can be a number of political parties in a country like Nepal, which is rich in social diversity. We adopted federalism for the same purpose. The leaders give priority to their family members and loyal ones while selecting election candidates and blame the constitution for the ensuing mistakes. They want to rule the country indefinitely through a two-party system. So we think the Congress-UML alliance is on the path of regression. Republicanism, federalism, secularism, inclusion and socialism-oriented systems are integrated five pillars of the present constitution. No attack on them will be tolerated. This is one focus of our ongoing meeting. We are also discussing some fresh international issues such as the developments in Bangladesh. We have yet to get a complete picture from there. But we can still learn some things. The centre of global affairs is changing and shifting to Asia. More importantly, there is a strong influence of such geopolitical forces in Nepal as well.Party chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal has said that there was an external hand in the recent change of coalition.External elements are active, in one way or the other. Some want to make our country a playground of external forces but our party and party chair firmly stood against it. The forces that wanted various things but didn’t get them from the government then started searching for a character suitable for them. People aren’t aware of such unseen elements but we should be careful. In the meeting, we are discussing this issue as well.Do you think geopolitics is the major reason for the ouster of the Dahal-led government?In his third term as a prime minister, Prachanda was working with certain priorities such as good governance, social justice and prosperity. He had taken governance seriously. Previously, there was a practice of exploiting state coffers in collusion between politicians, big businessmen and bureaucrats. The Prachanda-led government strongly stood against such a nexus. Actions against those involved in Bhutanese refugee scam, Lalita Niwas land grab, Bansbari Leather Shoe land scam, and gold smuggling are some examples. The government formulated a law to address the problems of loan shark victims. But some individuals associated with the coalition partners were involved in the scams. Were these bad elements linked to the Congress or the UML? Dahal entered into coalitions with both.The individuals were linked to partners in both the coalitions. The party chair made good governance his main priority but the Maoist Centre is the third-largest party so his hands were tied. When certain individuals were brought under investigation in corruption cases, the initiatives to change the government were expedited overnight. We can conclude that Prachanda government’s anti-corruption moves inspired other parties to oust it.You mentioned external interference as well as other parties’ fear of the government’s anti-corruption actions. Which one was the major reason for government change?The government’s anti-corruption drive is the main reason behind the formation of the new coalition. This drive brought the two largest parties together to form a government, which is unusual in the parliamentary system. The government is working to increase the threshold to secure seats under the proportional representation category. The proposed provision is against small parties, and the Maoist Centre has opposed this. Do you see the possibility of polarisation among the parties on this issue?When the ruling parties introduce new proposals that were not even discussed during the elections, we will definitely oppose them. We led the previous movements for people’s rights and we have to secure these rights. Thus the polarisation between those who want to trample on the statute and those who are against such attacks is inevitable. Is the Maoist Centre preparing to unify with other parties including the Nepal Communist Party led by Netra Bikram Chand Biplab?First, we are in the final stage of merging with the outfit of Mahindra Raya Yadav. Also, the Biplab-led party has endorsed the party unity proposal. We have to iron out some theoretical issues and make the party line clear in the changed national as well as international context. Dialogue between us is headed in the right direction.You earlier said party chair has urged other leaders to openly debate issues. Have they discussed why the Maoist party has lost its strength as well as the issue of the party chair holding leadership continuously for three and a half decades.Comrade Prachanda led the decade-long people’s war and subsequent political movements as well as the peace process, all of which made epochal changes in Nepal’s political history. No one can deny this. Therefore, Prachanda doesn’t need any position in the party. He is now a nationally as well as internationally established personality. But our party as well as the country needs him. Therefore, the discussions in the party are now aimed at making the best use of his personality in the larger interest of the society. As far as the reasons behind the setbacks we faced in the recent time are concerned, we had rightly assessed the situation in the past.But we couldn’t adapt to the changed context. We failed to develop our culture and lifestyle in line with our guiding ideology. Similarly, we failed to run the party in a proper way. We gave up our agendas and became power-centric. We developed anti-proletariat tendencies. We were gradually distanced from the public. Now we have decided that we must reestablish our relations with the working class and the oppressed. We have also failed to communicate about the important works we did when we were in the government. We need to tell the people what we did in their favour when we were in government in the past 15 years. There will also be some serious soul-searching.There is a perception that the Maoist Centre and its leaders are incapable of staying out of power.Our party’s general convention had decided to maintain a right balance in the party’s role in the government, Parliament and the street. It is true that we were in the past more engaged in the government. The party chair has already said that our focus won’t be the government from now on. \nWithin days of CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli and Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba reaching a deal to form a new government under Oli’s leadership, some Congress leaders including the two party general secretaries started doubting the deal’s implementation. Independent observers also have doubts over the longevity of the Congress-UML partnership. To get some insight, the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Congress Central Committee member Govind Raj Pokharel, who is also former vice-chair of National Planning Commission. Many have expressed doubt over the longevity of the Congress-UML alliance. What is your observation?There was a discussion in the political circles on the need for the Congress and the UML joining hands to address some serious problems the country has been facing for years. The issues of governance, flaws seen in the practice of the electoral system, and the national economy are some pressing issues that need to be addressed. In the meantime, the top leaders of the two largest parties reached a deal overnight. The dramatic turn of events made people suspect some unspoken reasons had brought the leaders of the two rival forces together. The leaders have stated that they joined hands mainly to review the constitution, to make changes in the electoral system, improve governance and address problems seen in the economic sector. These are the stated objectives. As far as my observation goes, people don’t have full faith in the leaders of the two parties because of past records. On the economic front, this coalition may achieve some improvements because both parties are on the same page. Both follow liberal economic ideas. Of late, even the UML has become increasingly liberal on economic issues. The private sector has welcomed the new alliance. There are already some signs of reforms. Their plan to make changes in the electoral system through constitutional amendment however is not easy. First, their numerical strength in the federal parliament, mainly in the upper house, is insufficient to amend the constitution. Such a move would be risky from a strategic perspective as well. Many groups and forces have reservations over various provisions of this constitution. Once they start the amendment process, it will be like opening Pandora’s Box. Thus I am optimistic only on the economic front. If they get that right, it will help address the society’s mass frustration.The two parties have cited the perennial political instability as a major reason behind their coming together. Can we now expect policy consistency as well?Political instability is an excuse to cover up their failures. Even the alliance of largest parties cannot guarantee political or policy stability. Numbers alone are not enough. Leaders also need to have a democratic culture and the capacity to manage emerging issues. Even governments led by a single party commanding up to two-thirds majority have failed. On certain occasions, coalition governments have done commendable jobs. Handling the post-quake situation and producing the constitution in 2015 were examples of big parties justifying their coalition. Thus even with some doubt, we can expect political stability and some economic reforms.The Congress unanimously endorsed the deal of party president Sher Bahadur Deuba and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli. But in public, leaders from the anti-establishment faction of the Congress don’t seem satisfied. Why this unease?The deal was made in a dramatic way without proper consultations with other leaders. At least those in the executive committees of the party should have been consulted. It is challenging for the Congress leaders to ally with their major rival, the UML. A cadre-based party, the UML’s style of governance is different to that of the Congress. When in government, the UML treats even government institutions, constitutional bodies and independent agencies as the party’s structures. Whereas the Congress allows more freedom to government agencies. So, there is a risk of the UML misusing state mechanisms while the Congress leaders are in the Cabinet. This is one big risk for the Congress. The second concern is the working style of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli. He is a towering personality, a hard-working leader, and with his strong command over his party organisation, he can swiftly implement any proposal. The Congress ministers who also have to listen to the concerns of the party’s top leaders may struggle to strike a balance. In Oli’s Cabinet, ministers are likely to get less freedom within their ministries. A rift is thus likely because of Prime Minister Oli’s working style.Why didn’t the Congress then send influential leaders to the Cabinet to check the prime minister?The leaders might not have been so interested in joining this government. They might have sensed intervention from the prime minister’s office and thought they might not be able to perform as per their expectation under Oli’s leadership. See, chiefs of the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre work in a dictatorial way. Once they are elected at the party convention for four years, they behave like dictators. They take decisions on their own without any consultations. People in Nepal often lobby for a directly-elected prime minister or President. I wonder what these leaders would do if they were directly elected as executive head. So, the problem is in the working style and attitude of our leaders, not in the constitution or the electoral system.Shekhar Koirala and Gagan Thapa had first pitched for joining hands with the UML to end ‘unnecessary bargaining’ of fringe parties. Suddenly, Deuba struck the deal with Oli. And, now Koirala and Thapa seem sceptical about the deal.The proposal of Koirala and Thapa was for Congress leading the government and the UML supporting it. In fact, Oli was ready to accept Congress leadership. He requested the Congress leaders to take the lead. Surprisingly, the negotiating team led by our party president reached an opposite deal. They offered government leadership to Oli.Then, could it be that, as some claim, Deuba and his wife Arzu were desperate to unseat Dahal fearing they could be dragged into corruption scams?I don’t know much about that scenario. But what I knew is that Oli was willing to join a Congress-led government.Why would Deuba, who is a very clever leader in making such give-and-take deals, have given up a chance to be prime minister right away?It’s true that all three party chiefs—Deuba, Oli and Dahal—are very clever in making deals in their own favour based on their numerical strength. A leader beats the other two on one occasion and on another, another of them comes out on top. It’s like a see-saw. This time Oli won the game.Congress General Secretaries Gagan Thapa and Bishwa Prakash Sharma have expressed suspicion over the implementation of the deal. Many say they did so as Deuba didn’t involve them in negotiations on power-sharing. Is it true?The party’s central work execution committee endorsed the deal signed by the two leaders. The leaders who participate in such meetings should speak up then and there if there is anything objectionable, instead of making such statements in public. Why didn’t they oppose it at the meeting? I don’t see any point in expressing doubt over the deal in public while endorsing the same in party committees.The two general secretaries also expressed doubt over Oli handing over government leadership to Deuba as per the agreement. Why this mistrust?The experience of the past two or three decades makes politicians suspicious of each other. Nepali politicians have hardly ever handed over government leadership easily. After four or five months of collaboration, some issues emerge and a rift is created. So, history makes us doubt that this coalition will last for three and half years. In the meantime, the party establishments have sidelined other factions when it comes to picking ministers, both at federal and provincial levels. When the government fails to perform as per expectation, party cadres of the ruling parties start criticising the government. Is it possible to amend the constitution as the two parties have announced?We can’t backtrack on the inclusive system. We must abide by the policy of inclusion in state agencies. The leaders who spoiled this system are saying that the proportional representation (PR) system is not working. But there is room to make our three-tier federal system more cost-effective. People get irritated when they see a large number of representatives benefitting from state coffers. We can bring down the number of local units from 753 to around 400. However, there should be sufficient wards as those units are directly involved in service delivery while the Palikas are more engaged in development activities. The number of ward members can also be decreased. In provinces, we don’t need PR seats as those elected from the provincial constituencies automatically represent the local communities. Likewise, the provincial cabinets can be downsized. Thus we can downsize the number of people who benefit from state coffers. This is vital to make the federal system sustainable. Similarly, we can rightsize the number of PR seats by adopting a rotational constituency for women, dalits and other marginalised communities. Only the candidates from underrepresented sections will compete in those constituencies. This will help elect competent people even from within the targeted communities. This is how we can address some concerns without compromising the inclusive system envisioned in the constitution.Why has the Congress picked gangsters and tainted individuals as ministers in provinces?The selection of such controversial individuals as ministers and policy makers will damage the party’s image. People are going to raise this issue seriously. In fact the pace of criminalisation and commercialisation of Nepali politics is faster than the political reform being undertaken to clean up politics.It seems intellectual leaders are being sidelined while gangsters are being promoted. Why is it happening?Because people from intellectual or political backgrounds voice critical views and leaders don’t like it. They speak what their conscience says is right. For instance, leaders like Mahesh Acharya and Minendra Rijal aren’t given any role in the party. It is a common problem in all the major political forces in Nepal.Is the space for leaders with intellectual backgrounds and having critical views being squeezed?The Congress used to be a very liberal organisation. But it has also become illiberal and leaders have become increasingly intolerant. All leaders—whether the seniors or young ones—are becoming less tolerant even of constructive criticism. Party leaders haven’t spoken against the selection of gangsters as ministers. Even the office bearers who are in decision making bodies and can change the decisions are silent now. This is dangerous. This is an example of how critical voices are sidelined.Haven’t the two young general secretaries been able to raise hope in the Congress?They are working like central committee members. General secretaries should be able to intervene while making crucial policy decisions. They can stop the party committees from making wrong decisions. But they are risk-averse. They are not taking the risk to fight the powerful party establishment.Historically, in all parties there is a trend of its anti-establishment faction bargaining for 40-45 percent seats in the party or government. If they don’t get an acceptable power sharing deal, they don’t cooperate with the party leadership. Is it a healthy democratic practice?Intra-party competition compels the leaders to do this. The ruthless establishment always sidelines party members and leaders if they aren’t loyal. So, the leadership of the anti-establishment has to protect such cadres because the rival factor too needs a strong support base of cadres to compete against the powerful establishment. Party establishments are strong due to centralised resources and other factors, so you need an equally strong force to compete against them. \nScores of people have been killed in landslides, floods and other monsoon-induced disasters within a month of the monsoon entering Nepal in the second week of June. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asks Jagadishwor Karmacharya, director general of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, what the department is doing to save people from disasters and whether our system is ready to cope with the challenges posed by climate change.Where is Nepal in terms of technology and expertise when it comes to forecasting the ever-changing weather patterns?If we compare to our situation a decade ago, we have made significant progress in setting up meteorological stations, collecting real-time data and increasing the frequency of weather predictions. We get rainfall data from around 350 stations, while we receive information about temperature and other related parameters from around 150 stations. We have an additional 175 centres to collect information about water levels. Our servers get real-time data every 10 minutes from all these stations. Besides that, we also have manual data collection centres. Thus, we have around 800 data collection centres in total. But we haven’t been able to set up enough stations in the Himalayan range due to difficult topography, low presence of government agencies and other factors. Also, we release radiosonde balloons to collect data on temperature, humidity and wind speed from the upper levels of the atmosphere. Overall, we have made huge strides in using technologies in the past decade, but it is still insufficient to cater to people’s expectations. They want specific weather information about their present location or destination. The expectation is valid. But our complex and diverse topography and meteorological phenomenon—ranging from the Tarai belt to the Himalayan range—makes accurate forecasts challenging. Kaski’s Lumle sees maximum rainfall in the country, and around 40 km north of it, the Jomsom area sees negligible rain. So great variability within a short distance adds to the challenge of forecasting.Do we have sufficient stations to cater to that variability?We need more stations because the higher you go, the more variabilities you find. In the plains, the weather pattern is more homogenous, while it is highly heterogeneous in the hills. In Tarai, even a station in around 100-150 kilometres may work because there is less variability of temperature as well as rainfall. But we need more stations in the hills where rain patterns drastically change.Are our methods and technologies being updated over time?Until around a decade ago, the forecasters used to predict based on their experience and the data received every three hours from the synoptic weather stations of Nepal and other neighbouring countries. At the time, we used to predict weather only for a day. Now, we synthesise the data collected from our systems and those from the modelling centres from India, China and other countries. Now, we can forecast for three days.Our capacity has significantly increased mainly in observing real time happenings. As I said, we take updates from hundreds of stations every 10 minutes. We also take satellite pictures from 16 channels of Japan’s Himawari Satellite, which has stationed its receiver in Nepal as well, also every 10 minutes. Until over a decade ago, we used to receive satellite pictures just once or twice a day. Even those pictures weren’t as good as those we get these days. We used to update surface-related data in three hours and upper air data in 12 hours. Based on that, we made a weather forecast for the next 12 hours. In comparison, we now have a large number of hydrological and meteorological real-time observation stations, the updates from Himawari and other satellites every 10 minutes and we have three radars to gather information. With the help of these technologies, now we can get immediate real-time updates. It helps us analyse the data of past hours and predict possible scenarios of the next six to 12 hours. We inform people accordingly. But we have to work more on the technology to make longer forecasts. Despite these progresses, we are still 15-20 years back in comparison to the technologies used by developed countries. We are behind in research. We need more expertise and an upgrade of our technology. Nepal doesn’t have its own satellite. Is this problematic?On the weather observation part, our work has not been hampered because we get data from the satellites of India, China and Japan. On the communication part, we are getting support from telecom companies—NTC and NCell—to transfer data. It covers most parts of the country. Absence of a satellite of our own is less of a concern compared to our other needs.Climate change has brought about massive changes in weather patterns. Do we have sufficient expertise to cope with this?The organisational structure and positions in our department haven’t changed much in over three decades. Demand for our work has drastically increased in the past two decades but we haven’t been able to cater to the demand. We need engineers capable of working with the latest technologies but we don’t have positions for such professionals in our current structure. We have procured some technologies and got some from our donors. But we don’t even have experts to use that as well.As you said, the department has made progress in the past decade but in this period climate change has progressed even faster. How do we keep up with this change?We face new challenges almost every year. In the past couple of years, mountain districts such as Manang and Mustang have not only witnessed rainfalls but also heavy downpours that even swept away bridges and other structures. Last year, over 30 hydropower projects were badly damaged by floods in eastern Nepal. The floods that wreaked havoc in Melamchi in 2021 were unprecedented. These incidents are evidence that climate change has already started to show unusual patterns and cause damages in this Himalayan range. We will face extreme weather patterns like long droughts and heavy rainfalls.The Dodhara weather station of Kanchanpur recorded 624mm of rainfall in 24 hours earlier this month. This is a new record. Before that, 540mm was the highest rainfall recorded, around two decades ago. Upward shifting of snowline in the mountains and formation of glacial lakes are other indications of the impacts of climate change. Don’t you think it’s already late to restructure government agencies, review policies and even redesign our systems?That is necessary. Devastation in Melamchi is one example that suggests the same. While developing such projects, we have to seriously consider possible impacts of climate change. Even if they analyse the possible scenario, they refer to the data of the past few decades. But things are changing so fast, decisions based on old data might not be useful. So, it is becoming more challenging to make projections. Design guidelines definitely need to be updated. Our division lacks policies, let alone updated ones. Though we are issuing red alerts and carrying out other tasks on scientific grounds, we don’t have a legal basis even to do these things.A large number of people in Nepal die in floods and landslides every year. Can we tweak our forecast system to save more lives?We have succeeded in reducing the deaths by floods in comparison to the loss we used to incur until 8-10 years ago. Earlier, we didn’t have flood alert service. It has been around a decade since we started the dedicated flood service. These days, we send mass SMS to the people of areas where floods may cause damage and for that we collaborate with telecoms—NTC and Ncell. We also work with district authorities and I/NGOs mainly in flood-prone districts to run campaigns and conduct drills. This has been quite effective. We are also taking similar initiatives in collaboration with telecom companies and other agencies to inform people on 13 various hydro-meteorological hazards such as, rains, lightning, winds.Working on floods is comparatively easier as it has certain catchment areas and we can focus on specific areas. So our efforts yield results. But in other incidents we can’t focus on certain areas. In floods, we inform the people hours before the flood so that they can shift to safe places. In the past, the death toll from floods used to be the highest. Now there are more deaths from landslides and lightning. We need to work more to give accurate information on lightning as well. Landslides vulnerability has increased due to extreme weather patterns, the impact of 2015 earthquake and rampant road construction.Why don’t people in Nepal follow and rely on weather forecasts? Is it due to negligence or lack of reliability of the prediction?It might be both. If the forecast doesn’t match reality, they may not follow or rely on us. So we need to improve our accuracy. Secondly, we need to increase awareness. Moreover, the weather isn’t as predictable as it used to be. So, we should keep on working, improving accuracy and making people aware. Many rely on international forecasts but not our own. Is our system less efficient?There are two aspects. One is getting accurate information and the second is user-friendly and attractive visual presentation of data, such as in mobile apps. We lag in the second part. Also, people want specific information about their locality and their intended destination. In the past, we used to give information by dividing the country in major regions such as eastern, central, western parts, tarai and hills. Now we have narrowed it down to each district. We need to work more on research.Have we succeeded in connecting weather forecasts to people’s livelihoods?The United Nations has launched the ‘Early Warning For All’ initiative to ensure that everyone on Earth is protected from hazardous weather, water, or climate events through life-saving early warning systems by the end of 2027. Various stakeholders need to join hands to implement it effectively as it has various components. Our expertise is to give as accurate information as we can. We give inputs but there are other agencies that go to the community level and work with the people.What are the things that need to be done in the changed context?We shouldn’t limit our work to simple forecasting but move to impact-based forecasts. For instance, we issue a seven-day Agromet Advisory Bulletin in collaboration with Nepal Agricultural Research Council which includes a summary on weather, crops, livestock, tables on weather and agrometeorological parameters, current weather information along with weather forecast (outlook). In a similar way, we can work with stakeholders on road transport as well. Then, we can make our forecast impactful, connect the general people and win their trust. But that requires proper policies and laws, updating this department’s organisational structure and enhancing the capacity of our human resource. \nToday, Gandaki Province, Lumbini Province, Karnali Province, and Sudurpaschim Province are expected to experience generally to mostly cloudy conditions, while the remaining provinces will see partly to generally cloudy skies. Light to moderate rain accompanied by thunder and lightning is likely in various parts of Lumbini, Karnali, and Sudurpaschim provinces, with a few showers also expected in Koshi, Bagmati, and Gandaki provinces, the Meteorological Forecasting Division said.There is a possibility of heavy rainfall in isolated areas of Gandaki, Lumbini, and Karnali provinces.Tonight, the entire country will witness partly to generally cloudy conditions.

Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nDespite slowed economic growth, Nepal’s external sector appears stronger than ever, thanks to remittances, tourism and the appreciation of the US dollar.Nepal’s three external indicators—foreign exchange reserve, remittance earnings, and tourism income, which represent all international economic transactions between residents of the country—reached a historic high in the last fiscal year that ended mid-July.Conversely, the country’s statistical body, the National Statistics Office, has projected Nepal’s economic growth to be at a meagre 3.87 percent for 2023-24 due to the poor performance of the internal sector. According to experts, the mismatch is due to political uncertainty and growing corruption, as the external sector's growth did not support the internal sector. “It’s good that tourism income has grown. This will generate jobs,” said Nara Bahadur Thapa, former executive director at Nepal Rastra Bank, the country’s central bank. “But at the same time, growing remittance earnings means no job prospects at home. But the money sent by migrant workers has boosted foreign exchange reserves to an all-time high.”Though Nepal is in a remittance trap, the country could turn this into an opportunity by investing in the real sector. “The best option to channel remittances is to bring the private sector on board for investment in the productive sector,” said Thapa.Experts said that since the interest rate on credit has dropped significantly due to the huge amount of liquidity, investment is all that the country needs now. In the last fiscal year, Nepal’s gross foreign exchange reserves increased 32.6 percent to Rs2.04 trillion, a historic high. According to experts, such a trend in a least-developed country indicates no investment. According to the central bank report released on Sunday, remittance inflows increased 16.5 percent to Rs1.44 trillion in the last fiscal year, the highest amount on record.The remittances have been increasing because youth are leaving. In the last fiscal year, foreign employment permits were issued for 741,302 individuals (460,103 first-time and 281,199 renewed). The number is a slight reduction from 774,976 in the previous fiscal year.Under the service account, travel income, or expenditure made by foreign tourists, increased 32.1 percent to Rs82.33 billion in the review year, the highest revenue on record. The total number of tourist arrivals increased to 1.12 million in the last fiscal year from 862,992 in the previous fiscal year.The balance of payments remained at a surplus of Rs502.49 billion in the review year.With the upbeat external sector, the internal sector has remained dismal.“This is because the private sector investment has been shrinking for the last two years,” said Chandra Dhakal, president of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the apex private sector body. He was speaking at an interaction in Kathmandu on Sunday.“As Nepal’s industrial capacity is under 40 percent. The private sector investment that contributes 86 percent to the economy has shrunk. This will naturally not generate employment opportunities.”He said that the demand for workers has boomed in the country, where the private sector has thrived. The World Bank said in its recent report that frequent political changes, a significant drag on businesses for over a decade, have dampened private investment. Thriving corruption and lack of accountability have stalled growth and forced tens of thousands of young Nepalis to try their luck abroad.Thapa, a former official at the central bank, said that with billions of dollars in the banks, the incumbent government has an opportunity to take advantage of it.Nepal is currently ruled by an unusual coalition of the two largest parties and this brings both challenges and opportunities. “The government has to facilitate the private sector. It has to ask the private sector to bring forward ready-to-invest projects,” said Thapa. The capital market is gaining momentum. “Through initial public offerings (IPOs) and follow-on public offers (FPOs), the government can facilitate raising money and enable the private sector to invest in the productive sectors that create jobs,” said Thapa. However, political wrangling has paralysed the country.The Securities Board of Nepal (SEBON) and Nepal Tourism Board have been headless for months. Nepal Electricity Authority has yet to open the door for signing the power purchase agreement with the big developers even though the country has huge loanable funds.“The government and the private sector both have to invest,” said Dhakal. “For every rupee the government spends, the private sector has been spending Rs5.”Economists say that the government’s capital injection into the economy would encourage the private sector to pump the investment.Over the years, private investment has remained sluggish. For example, the import restriction imposed by the government two years ago discouraged the private sector from spending, decreasing capital in the market and intermediate goods imports. As a result, public consumption and investment contracted, ultimately impacting the government’s revenue collection.Economists and statisticians say Nepal, which is set to graduate from the least developed countries by 2026, does not have the environment to achieve double-digit economic growth in the immediate future due to low investment from the government and the private sector.The country’s statistical office recently said that, given the ongoing investment, Nepal’s growth rate will neither slow down nor grow. It will remain static. According to economists, everything from wages to business growth and social security to other state benefits will remain static, which will encourage youth to try their luck abroad. \nWhen the political parties in the House of Representatives appear divided over the idea of amending the constitution, vaguely floated by the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, the Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal (JSP-Nepal), has said it would welcome it provided the party’s demands are addressed.KP Sharma Oli became prime minister based on a July 1 agreement reached between the Congress and the UML. In the same deal, the two largest parties also agreed to take turns to head the government and amend the constitution, purportedly to ensure political stability, among other things. “The national consensus government will prioritise reviewing the strengths, weaknesses, and complications observed in implementing the constitution and will focus on amending the constitution and enacting related laws to ensure political stability,” Prime Minister Oli stated in Parliament on July 21, during his floor test. Some parties, including the CPN (Maoist Centre), the third largest party in the House of Representatives, have raised serious concerns about the intentions behind the proposed amendments, accusing the big parties of attempting to revoke some progressive features of the statute. Maoist Centre chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal was ousted from the position of prime minister on July 12 after the two largest parties joined hands to form a government. The Rastriya Swatantra Party, the fourth largest in the lower house, has also questioned the motives behind the Congress-UML deal. The JSP-Nepal, however, is comparatively more open to the idea of revising the constitution. The party has demanded that its certain concerns must be addressed should there be any amendments to the statute. The party has called for the formation of a constitutional review commission comprised of experts to propose amendments. The party’s central committee meeting held from August 11 to 14 decided to support amendments based on the recommendations of an elite commission. The party has also demanded amending the constitution to place local units under the provincial government. Likewise, it has demanded a directly elected executive head, a fully proportional election system, a federal justice system with proportional and inclusive representation, and self-governance based on national and ethnic identity. Yadav, who led a different political party, had submitted these proposals in the Constituent Assembly while drafting the statute as well.“The names of provinces should reflect their identities,” mentions the decision of the party’s central committee meeting.Many of JSP-Nepal’s demands related to amendments echo Yadav’s previous positions. Although the party had compromised on its demands during the constitution-making process for consensus, it is now advocating for a directly elected executive head, among other things. “Most of our current demands are the same ones that we had registered during the constitution-drafting process,” Prakash Adhikari, a party leader and a federal lawmaker from the party, told the Post. “If the two major parties address our demands, we are open to revising the constitution.”But Chandrakishore, a political analyst from Madhesh, finds the JSP-Nepal’s demands as irrelevant. Except for the directly elected executive head, the issues the party now has raised are old ones, he told the Post.“The party’s latest demands are the issues of the Madhesh Movement, but Yadav then chose to align with the ruling parties and betrayed the movement,” Chandrakishore told the Post. “Now he is again raising the same old issues in an attempt to placate the Madheshi people.” “If JSP-Nepal wants to truly engage with the people, it needs a leadership overhaul. Repeating past demands won’t work.” Despite lending support to Prime Minister Oli during the trust vote, the party was not accommodated in the Cabinet, while its splinter faction, the Janata Samajbadi Party holds a key portfolio in the Oli government. After Ashok Rai, then federal chair of the party, along with six lawmakers, split the party on May 5 to form the Janata Samajbadi Party, the JSP-Nepal’s strength in the House has diminished markedly.The party concluded its general convention in June unanimously electing Yadav as party chair. Even after over two months of the convention, the party is still to elect its office bearers, though it has formed a central executive council. A party’s central committee meeting last week demanded that the parliamentary and provincial constituencies be redrawn based on the latest census. Likewise, the party has also called for proportional representation in the National Assembly. Similarly, the party also vows to dissolve District Coordination Committees, arguing they are redundant under the federal structure.  \nNepal witnessed an alarming rise in the suicide cases in the last fiscal year.According to data provided by the Nepal Police, 7,223 people killed themselves in the fiscal year 2023-024, which is the highest ever recorded in a year.“Around 20 people killed themselves on an average every 24-hour in the last fiscal year,” said Dr Pomawati Thapa, chief of the Non-communicable Disease and Mental Health Section at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “The number is the highest ever recorded in any fiscal year.”Nepal is among the countries with the highest suicide rates.Police data show that 6,993 people killed themselves in the fiscal year 2022-023, followed by 6,792 in the fiscal year 2021-022.As many as 7,117 people took their own lives in the fiscal year 2020-021, during which the country witnessed the second and third wave of the coronavirus pandemic. Reducing one-third of premature mortality from non-communicable diseases through prevention, treatment and promotion of mental health and well-being is among the UN-backed Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) targets to which Nepal is committed.Experts say the suicide rate is an indicator of premature mortality within the SDGs, which are a follow-up to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).“At the time when the government committed to SDGs in 2015, around 16 people took their own lives every 24 hours,” said Basudev Karki, a consultant psychiatrist. “Now the number has risen to 20. Our government had committed to reduce the suicide rate to 9.7 per 100,000 each year by 2022, but this number rose to 24, and last year it increased further to 25.”The government aims to reduce the suicide rate to 4.7 per 100,000 population by 2030 to meet the SDG targets, but as the deadline nears, more people are killing themselves every day. Mental health experts say people do not attempt suicide for any single reason, but rather due to a complex mix of factors including the rising cost of living and struggle to manage even their most basic needs such as food, housing, healthcare, and job security.Whatever the cause, suicides and suicide attempts have a ripple effect, impacting not only the individual but also families, friends, colleagues, communities, and societies, according to themA study carried out by the Nepal Health Research Council before the start of the pandemic shows that more than 10 percent of the adult population had mental issues in their lifetime and 4.3 percent were undergoing some sort of mental crisis.The prevalence of suicidality, including current suicidal thoughts, past suicide attempts, and a future likelihood of suicidal thoughts, was found to be prevalent in the 7.2 percent population.“Even those individuals who appear healthy on the outside could also be struggling with serious mental health problems,” said Karki. “People generally do not like to talk about mental health issues due to the social stigma attached, and lack of awareness. To tackle the growing mental health problems, authorities concerned have to take multiple approaches.”Meanwhile, officials at the Ministry of Health and Population said that they are aware of the growing burden of mental health issues and the rising suicide rate and have been taking various measures to address the problems.“Along with providing free medications for mental health problems at state-run health facilities, we have been taking several other measures that include imparting mental health screening training for health workers,” said Thapa, chief of the Non-communicable Disease and Mental Health Section at the division. “We have been working to declare two local units—Palungtar Municipality of Gorkha and Bagchaur Municipality of Salyan—as model municipalities for mental health.”According to officials, various mental health programmes will be rolled out in these local units, including screening for mental health problems and training for health workers, community workers, teachers, female community health volunteers, and others. Awareness campaigns will be launched, and health facilities will be strengthened to provide basic services for mental health problems.“This programme will be launched as a pilot and will be gradually expanded to other local units,” said Thapa. “The main aim of the programme is to encourage the local bodies to take responsibility for addressing the growing mental health issues. We will also launch an awareness drive to reduce the suicide rate, alcohol consumption, and substance use.”The World Health Organisation says one in four people in the world are affected by mental or neurological disorders at some point in their lives, and around 450 million people currently suffer from such conditions, placing mental disorders among the leading causes of ill health and disability worldwide.If you or someone you know is considering suicide, please contact the following helplines.Nepal Mental Hospital suicide hotline: 1166Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital suicide prenvention hotline: 9840021600:Patan Hospital crisis helpline for suicide prevention: 9813476123The Transcultural Psychosocial Organisation: 16600102005 \nCPN (Unified Socialist) leader Ram Kumari Jhakri was among the most active leaders involved in the formation of the party after split with the CPN-UML in 2021. Three years on, she is now the most vocal leader calling for a unification of the two parties. Why didn’t the new party perform well, and what made her lobby for a party merger? Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat with former minister Jhakri for more insights.You worked actively to form the CPN (Unified Socialist), but the party couldn’t perform well. It couldn’t even become a national party from the general elections. What went wrong?We formed the CPN (Unified Socialist) out of compulsion. When Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli—who was prime minister at the time as well—dissolved the House of Representatives in December 2020, we firmly stood against his move, saying that it sowed the seeds of political instability. We staged huge protests and moved the Supreme Court against the decision of Oli, our party chair at the time. I was among the petitioners. Once the top court reinstated the House, we expected the party to move smoothly. Unfortunately, that couldn’t happen. The party establishment led by Oli and the rival faction took extreme actions against each other. The agitating faction announced action against the party chair, and the party establishment expelled us from the party itself. When Oli dissolved the House a second time, we protested the move as it brought instability. We were in favour of transforming the party through intra-party struggle, but the situation took some unexpected turns. We didn’t quit the party with a lofty plan of making a new revolutionary organisation. We were compelled to do so.Our new party accommodated many genuine leaders who had been sidelined in the UML. But ultimately, old leaders heavily dominated the new party’s central committee. They were active leaders of their time but were out of touch with the new, changing context. Young leaders didn’t get space in party committees. I proposed recruiting at least 40 percent members under 40 years in the central committee and over 50 percent members under 30 years in the district committees. I made a 29-year-old leader the chair of the district committee in my home district. In 42 days, I attended 36 district conventions where youths in their 30s were elected district committee chairs. I tried to reach out to municipalities to promote youths in the party chapters. But at the central level, old faces dominated party committees. That didn’t attract people to the party or impress the general public. Thus, it failed to gather steam right from the beginning.Many think that Madhav Kumar Nepal’s selection as party chief was a wrong move since he had led the UML for 15 years and become prime minister, and people didn’t find novelty in the new party. Do you think so too?Madhav Kumar Nepal has been the most active leader in the party since its inception. Whatever the party has achieved so far is because of him. But a party leader must mobilise teams with defined roles and responsibilities and continuously motivate and engage them in result-oriented tasks. He works a lot but doesn’t mobilise teams effectively. Observers say the Unified Socialist was formed due to the personality clash between top leaders and that it lacked a national agenda and a clear policy to prove the need for a new party. Do you feel so?Our immediate agenda was safeguarding the constitution and ensuring political stability in the country. We protested the House dissolution guided by the same policy. But when provincial governments were made like satellites of the federal government, we couldn’t play any role in stabilising them.The UML is guided by the policy of People’s Multiparty Democracy, propounded by the late Madan Bhandari. There was a debate on further enhancing the policy in the changed context. A large section of Left intellectuals were interested in contributing to that. We could have engaged them in the process. But our party stopped the debate on that topic as well. We missed the chance of engaging many critical individuals in the discourse and having a relatively different policy. When in the UML, we practised direct elections of party representatives and leaders from the conventions. Unfortunately, leaders of the new party, Unified Socialist, made a statute that gave powers to the party leadership to nominate party secretariat, office bearers and other members. Leaders would pick those who are loyal to them. This regressive approach killed competition in the party.You are known to prefer a more proactive work and decision-making approach. There are rumours that you have been fed up with the party’s lacklustre style and are mulling to join the mother party, UML.If I were to decide only from a personal perspective, I would have done so much earlier because I had multiple opportunities in the past. But I am for party merger because I don’t see any relevance of running multiple retail shops under communist banners because we are not substantially different from each other in terms of policies. Our electoral system has also made it necessary. The Unified Socialist can’t run like this. We must accept reality and decide—merging our party with the UML is better than running it this way. But it seems that the top leaders of the twin parties are still bitter about each other.True, the bitterness lingers on, mainly among the top leaders. We have also made some mistakes. The UML offered some opportunities to the Unified Socialist, and we should have made some offers to capitalise on the favourable situation. At one time, UML leaders proposed our party chair as a candidate for the vacant post of the country’s President. We should have devised our own proposal and made a win-win deal. But we ran away and squandered the opportunity. If Madhav Kumar Nepal had become president on the UML’s proposal, our party might have been reunited with the UML much earlier. I also took an initiative to that end but in vain. Later also, UML chair Oli visited our party chair’s residence to have our party on board the government. But the reaction from our side ruined things. We are certainly not responding to the UML responsibly. Rather than irritate the UML, we must turn each positive gesture into an opportunity for party unity.One more factor is blocking the unity between the two parties. There are a large number of second-rung leaders in the UML who can’t directly confront Oli. They are now encouraging former President Bidya Devi Bhandari to join active politics and trying to make decisions in their favour through her. Oli knows these leaders will support Nepal when he returns to the UML. Why would he [Oli] then merge the fringe party and create another power centre against himself? He knows Madhav Kumar Nepal will challenge him with the backing of the dissidents. It is natural for a leader to think twice before allowing another leader of your stature to create a parallel power centre within the organisation. Even I would have thought twice. This is a major factor hindering party unity.Your party chair and other key leaders seem quite close to CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal and critical of UML chair Oli. Moreover, Oli often lambasts Madhav Kumar Nepal publicly. Will they still merge the parties?In principle, our party is open for unity with any Left party. But party cadres won’t join the Maoist Centre. If our leadership decides to merge the party with the Maoists, a huge number of our party cadres will join the UML. Unity between the UML and the Unified Socialist is natural because we grew up in the same background and orientation. But we are quite different from Maoists. Several groups trying to form new political outfits have failed to emerge as a major political force and sustain themselves. You worked in a big party for years and also helped establish a new one. What are the challenges of forming a new political organisation in Nepal?Political parties sustain if they evolve with society. If you trace the history of the Nepal’s Congress and communist parties, you will see how they have evolved over the past seven decades. They competed against each other but joined hands to fight autocratic forces towards establishing democracy. They have done hundreds of progressive things in society. Their major fault is that they have multiple entry points but no exit policy. The only exit way is the death of the leaders. This has caused unhealthy practices and created dissident groups.The dissidents who didn’t get any space within their party formed new outfits. They also amplified negative narratives against the old parties. It happened with the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre. Had there been an exit system in the party, the situation wouldn’t be this bad. But new political parties can’t sustain without their own political ideology and orientation. You may form an organisation, cash in on people’s frustration and achieve some immediate gains, but outfits can’t sustain.But recent electoral trends show that Nepalis are seeking alternative forces and new faces. Can we be oblivious to that?You are right. We have seen such trends in the Panchayat system as well. But garnering votes during elections for one term and establishing a sustainable political force are two different things.  \nHosts Nepal made a flying start to their SAFF U-20 Championship campaign as they defeated Sri Lanka 1-0 in the opening game at the ANFA Complex in Satdobato, Kathmandu on Sunday.Nirajan Dhami scored the sole goal in the first half, sealing Nepal all three points.The victory puts Nepal in a strong position to reach their fifth semi-final of the biennial competition.The top two teams from each group advance into the last four. The Gorkhalis play Bangladesh next, on Thursday.Nepal are one of the tournament favourites alongside the winners of the last three editions, India, who start their defence of the title against Bhutan in Group B opener on Monday.Nepal started brightly and thought they had taken the lead after just one minute when Dhami diverted a freekick from Abinash Syangtan into the net with a diving header but the goal was disallowed for an offside.Dhami continued to become a threat to Sri Lanka and found the breakthrough in the 24th minute with a dazzling finish after good work from Samir Tamang, who skillfully placed the ball into the area for Dhami with an overhead kick.Dhami’s goal had arrived after a string of attacks that saw Tamang’s volley hitting the upright in the 12th minute and Nirjan Karki testing the Sri Lanka goalkeeper Ahamed Shareef in the 19th minute.Sri Lanka were helpless most of the time and never really troubled Nepal goalie Jiyarath Shekh, with their only attempt coming in the 35th minute when Johnjimron Harish’s cross almost managed to slip past Nepal goalkeeper.Nepal were more comfortable after the break but wasteful on several occasions.However, it was Sri Lanka who should have capitalised on a loose pass from Syangtan allowed captain Muhammedhu Munsif to charge into the Nepal area but the Gorkhalis soon outnumbered him.Tamang should have doubled Nepal’s lead in the 63rd minute after Ram Thapa’s cutback found him unmarked just outside the six yard box but Tamang flashed the ball over the crossbar.Nepal also had another clear opportunity in the 76th in a carbon copy of the previous opportunity, this time Syangtan passing the ball backwards for Ashwin Ghorasainee but the defender too ended up shooting over the post.Bhomjan reached the goal in the 80th after Syangtan put him through but Sri Lanka goalkeeper Shareef reacted quickly to foil the opportunity.Dhami made the last effort of the match with a brilliant volley but the crossbar again came between him and the goal.…..SAFF U-20 ChampionshipNepal1-0Sri LankaNirajan Dhami 24’Playing MondayIndia15:00BhutanEnglish Premier LeagueResultsMan United1-0FulhamIpswich Town0-2LiverpoolArsenal2-0WolvesEverton0-3BrightonNewcastle1-0SouthamptonNottm Forest1-1BournemouthWest Ham1-2Aston VillaLa LigaResultsAthletic1-1GetafeReal Betis1-1GironaGelta Vigo2-1AlavesLas Palmas2-2SevillaOsasuna1-1LeganesValencia1-2BarcelonaSerie AGenoa2-2Inter MilanParma1-1FiorentinaAC Milan2-2TorinaEmpoli0-0Monza \nForeign Minister Arzu Rana, who is in New Delhi on a five-day India visit, is meeting Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and her Indian counterpart, S Jaishankar, on Monday.Rana is scheduled to pay a courtesy call on Modi on Monday, said the Embassy of Nepal in New Delhi in a statement late on Sunday. She will also hold a bilateral meeting with Jaishankar.Rana is expected to hand over Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s invitation to the Indian prime minister to visit Nepal, according to officials privy to the development.Rana on Sunday embarked on her trip at Jaishankar’s invitation. This is her first foreign visit after being appointed the foreign minister a month ago.During her stay in the Indian capital, she will also meet senior Bharatiya Janata Party leaders, among others.Rana and Jaishankar are expected to dwell on issues earlier discussed at the seventh joint commission meeting that took place in Kathmandu earlier this year, according to the officials.The joint commission meeting had reviewed all aspects of bilateral relations and areas of cooperation including connectivity, infrastructure development, economic partnership, trade, transit, investment, power, water resources, culture, tourism, sports, health and education.Jaishankar had arrived in Kathmandu leading the Indian delegation to the highest bilateral mechanism between Nepal and India entrusted with reviewing the whole spectrum of bilateral ties.Rana’s India visit comes a week after new Indian foreign secretary Vikram Misri concluded a two-day familiarisation visit of Nepal.Rana’s visit is expected to focus on discussing matters of mutual interest rather than signing understandings or agreements, a joint-secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the Post.In her meeting with Misri in Kathmandu, Rana called for additional air routes to Nepal to increase connectivity with India; setting up a sophisticated laboratory at the Nepal-India border to test the quality of vegetables and fruits imported from India for pesticides; and expediting the negotiations for the finalisation of the detailed project report of the Pancheshwar Multipurpose Project that has been in limbo for decades, among other things.They also discussed issues such as discharging water from the Tanakpur canal to the Nepal side, river training of the Banganga, Khado, and Rapti with India’s assistance, and the inauguration of the suspension bridge in Darchula on Nepal-India border, according to the foreign ministry. \nChhabilal Dahal aka Pushpa Kamal aka Bishwas aka Prachanda has been a champion of change all his life—starting with his own name(s) to the political system. He loathes historical continuities and strives for ruptures—agragami chhalang, as he so enthusiastically pronounced in his initial days in parliamentary politics post the 2006 political changes. In fact, he chased change even as a young political leader of the Nepal Communist Party (Mashal), having changed several parties and factions before finally replacing his seniors and mentors to lead the party in 1989. But after three-and-a-half decades of being the party chief, he has no fascination for change—at least when it comes to leadership change in his party.As the CPN (Maoist-Centre)—as the party is now called after several name changes over the past decade-and-a-half, struggles to stay relevant in the aftermath of its ouster from the coalition with the CPN-UML, the question of leadership change has become prominent once again. In earlier times, anyone who talked of change in the party's leadership, strategies or ideological standpoints would be forced to leave the party altogether—Mohan Baidya, Baburam Bhattarai and Netra Bikram Chand are in case. Dahal continued to maintain his tight grip over the party even if that meant things falling apart in the party. Prachanda, the fierce one, needed to show he was the boss.This time around, Janardan Sharma is leading the band of those questioning Dahal's relevance as party chair or calling on him to hand over party leadership to younger leaders. As expected, Dahal's hardline supporters are worried that any discussion about changing leadership now, when the party is at its weakest since its resurgence in parliamentary politics in the mid-2000s, damages the party further. But Dahal's interlocutor himself has claimed that his calls for leadership change are aimed at ensuring that Dahal’s \"revolutionary\" contributions to Nepali politics last long. For Dahal to leave a lasting legacy as a changemaker, Sharma argues, he should step aside and make way for the new generation leaders within the party.Sharma isn't wrong in this regard. After all, how long can a party remain relevant under a single leader? Indeed, there must be a saturation point somewhere, and the Maoist Party seems to have gone past that point. From its heyday as the single-largest party, with 220 seats in the 601-strong first Constituent Assembly to a distant third with just 23 seats in the 275-strong Parliament, the Maoist Centre has been on a downward spiral for quite long now. And with coalition change for making and breaking governments seemingly being the only definition of change for the party now, there are obvious misgivings about Dahal's leadership. Moreover, with the recent breakthrough in the Transitional Justice Act, there are new hopes for a fairly acceptable, if not entirely successful, culmination of the peace process. A post-peace Nepal would certainly seek a new dispensation across political parties. Perhaps it is time for the Maoist Centre to realise that Dahal's alternative as party chair will be found only when it starts looking for one. \nIn the early hours of July 12, a massive debris flow in what was normally considered a small gully—locally called Sindure Kholsi at Simaltal on the Muglin-Narayanghat road—swept two night buses carrying a total of 62 passengers into the Trishuli River, a major tributary of Gandaki River. Although the rescue operation began immediately, two weeks of searching yielded only 24 bodies, while 35 others and the buses they were travelling in are still missing. Three of the passengers managed to swim to safety. The government task force formed to investigate the accident submitted its report on August 6 with meticulous recommendations to avoid such mishaps on the highways in future. Meanwhile, 38 other such fatal incidents occurred by mid-July in different parts of the country, killing 76 people in their homes when debris flow buried or damaged their houses. One may ask, shouldn’t the high rate of recurrence of mudslides, debris flow and landslides prompt further investigations to understand what triggers these events so that appropriate strategies can be formulated to reduce risks in remote villages? Heavy rains and debris flowsThe Simaltal misfortune raises questions about the intensity and duration of the rainfall that night in the Sindure Kholsi watershed; according to the investigation report, some eyewitnesses observed heavy rain. Apart from the newly built rural roads, what condition was the watershed’s land in to generate such high amounts of debris? Despite the debris flow possibly lasting for quite some time, we don't have a ballpark estimate of how much. Answers to these questions are crucial for those in other parts of the country grappling with similar problems. After all, debris or mudflows (commonly called landslides) have been one of the biggest and most recurrent threats to lives and property. It mostly occurs in and around mid-hill settlements where natural and human actions constantly alter drainage channels. The latest Solukhumbu flood, which caught global attention, reminds us that we also have infrequent yet devastating floods in higher elevations attributed to glacier lake outburst floods (GLOFs)—a different story altogether, including its trigger factor. A cursory look at landslides across the country in 2020 shows how killer landslides have started to defy our general understanding of them. In Marang, Myagdi, the debris deposited in existing gullies during the rural road construction—similar to the one we witnessed in Simaltal this year—flowed down, causing devastation. The landslides in Barekot, Jajarkot, originated from farmlands with no road. At the same time, houses in Lidi, Sindhupalchok, were buried by debris brought down by the failure of an abandoned terrace way above the village. In Parbat and Tanahun, massive debris flow originated from some very well-guarded forest areas above the villages that killed people and damaged houses and farms. In Baglung, a combination of landslides and a series of landslide-blocked-lake-outburst floods swept away 76 houses. While comparing these places is difficult due to varied geographical conditions, one common element across all of these cases is that they were all triggered by high-intensity localised rain, a trend on the rise due to the local impacts of a changing climate yet poorly understood. In 2021, some studies covered heavy localised rain, which deposited massive amounts of debris on the bed of the Melamchi River, rendering the intake of the Melamchi Water Supply Project impotent. Simaltal indicated a similar event on a smaller scale. Numerous incidents of such heavy localised rain across the country haven’t attracted media attention despite causing substantial and widespread damage. The investigation in Simaltal was an opportunity to dig deeper to examine the issues related to heavy localised rain, which would have provided crucial data to understand the changing nature of rainfall.Taming the monsoon runoffBoth the monsoon disasters and water scarcity in the winter, which are worsening, are two sides of the same coin. Increasing localised rain not only leads to further disaster risks but also intense water scarcity in winter since the rainwater that is supposed to seep into aquifers won’t have enough time to do so. The government’s rescue-centric preparedness approach has been instrumental in reducing the human toll—a commendable feat, indeed—but it’s far from effectively preventing such incidents, much less augmenting groundwater in the long run. Addressing water-induced disasters thus should take a two-pronged approach: Reduce the risks caused by heavy rain during the monsoon and find ways to augment depleting groundwater sources to ensure water security in winter. The right time to do both is during the monsoon through the management of monsoon runoff. Except for those located on the ridge area, every village—or even farm—has its watershed from where rainwater flows down through small channels in the form of runoff. When altered, these channels get widened, deepened, or blocked by both natural and human actions and become a cause for debris flow during heavy rain. A doable solution to reduce the risk of debris flow would be to thus tame the runoff by keeping it spread over a wider area, allowing it to accumulate in ponds or converge only in stable channels that have conveyed large volumes of runoff in the past. Revisiting past effortsIn the 1990s, some efforts were made to reinforce what people in the mountain villages traditionally did to tame the runoff and stabilise active gullies and landslides threatening farms and houses in villages in the hills of Lalitpur. It primarily involved three key actions: Appraising the landscape in and around the villages to understand the unique water problems at different elevations due to their geographical context. Then, mapping drainage channels in the watershed to look for places to divert runoff and store them temporarily in multiple dugout ponds. It would cut debris flow risks as well as augment depleting groundwater—a common concern in the hills, which is growing in recent years manifested in the drying springs and rivulets. After that, points of runoff accumulation, along with changes in the size and direction of runoff channels, would be monitored. The results were remarkable. Active landslides and gullies stabilised and became greener—a sign of increased soil moisture—without additional investment. It’s time that lessons from these experiences be reexamined and replicated in at least those places that have begun receiving heavy localised rain to reduce the risk of debris flow and/or villages where springs and rivulets are drying up or have dried altogether.  \nI was invited to a literary programme organised by Srasta Samaj and Bhairav Puraskar Guthi on August 19, 2024, in Kathmandu. A note was appended to the invitation—Rochak Ghimire would turn 84 on that day and would be felicitated by a large group of writers and readers. Being very familiar with the literary contribution of Ghimire, this news unfolded a history of the literary times to me. Ghimire has made history as a publisher of the literary magazine Rachana, which started in 1961 when Nepal was on the cusp of an era that introduced several political and ideological challenges. The conspicuous response to the sensitivity of the times came from literary magazines. Roop-Rekha, a prominent literary magazine, came following hard on the heels of Panchayat, an autocratic system of government introduced by King Mahendra after dissolving people's elected parliament and jailing Prime Minister BP Koirala in 1960. I have drawn more examples of how literary magazines responded to such systems later in the article. Ghimire made a humble start, which was the best way to remain outside the influence of the nascent political system called Panchayat. He spent Rs500 to publish 300 copies at that time. I remember writing a long survey and analysis of the 100 issues of Rachana, which was published in the magazine in 2008. Remarkably, the literary magazine continues to this date and brings together cohorts of people who write literature and those who come to listen to literary discourses in literary programmes. Ghimire has been doing that through Rachana.Literary magazines were published at different times of the long autocratic Rana rule (1846-1950) in Nepal. They were the best means of creating a forum of expression, which would be creative and metaphorical. A careful study of Nepali literature written over the times shows that some of the most creative minds of this land had chosen literary writing as the medium of their expression. But it was challenging during the Rana regime. The writers, therefore, chose some easy ways. One was publishing literary magazines from Banaras, but they would not publish articles that would directly earn the wrath of the Rana rulers. Banaras had become the hub of publication for the Nepali writers who were either studying there or doing some small publication works. They would publish books on religious, social, folk and astrological themes and sell them within Nepal. Scholars have analysed this theme under the rubric 'print capitalism' by using a term introduced by Italian professor Francesca Orsini. I have no space to discuss the theme here.That activity was quite prolific in Banaras from the last years of the 19th century and the first or second decades of the 20th century. Editors and writers published their works and 'marketised' them among the Nepali language readers in Nepal and India. A small but quite diverse reading public came into existence. The literary magazines published by the youths there set a tradition of publication. They created forums to express their feelings and ideas couched in the language of religion or social or ethical writings. Literary magazines like Upanyas Tarangini (1902), Sundari (1906) and Madhavi (1914) were published from Banaras. But another centre, a hill area of Darjeeling, followed that tradition. The publication of Paras Mani Pradhan's Chandrika (1918) is one example. The magazines published in the 30s of the 20th century from Banaras and Kathmandu had a strong connection. They wanted to create a reading public whose sphere was small but important. The role played by 'print capitalism' was remarkable. In that context, the publication of Nepali Sahitya Sammelan Patrika (1931) from Darjeeling, Sharada (1934) from Kathmandu and Udaya (1936) from Banaras should be mentioned here.The publication of Sharada from Kathmandu is a vital event in Nepal's literary times. A cohort of writers decided to establish a forum to publish their views and inner feelings through symbols, metaphors and stories. The path was arduous, as they had to convince the Rana Prime Minister Juddha Shumsher, who was not happy about such a publication. But he saw some energy working there and allowed the writers to proceed with the work. He didn’t want them to cross a certain limit, though.Nepali literary critic Yadunath Khanal interpreted that juncture of time as a moment of tacit agreement between the writers and PM Juddha Shumsher. In one editorial of Sharada compiled in Sharadaka Sampadakiya Bicharharu (2001) by Shiva Regmi, we can read an important story. The editorial was obviously written by Riddhibahadur Malla.When a group of writers got an appointment to meet Juddha, he was sitting with a British envoy named Col CT Dox. An interpreter communicated the ideas of the British official to the writers. Dox's opinion was that since there was already a government newspaper named Gorkhapatra, there was no need to ask for another magazine. The envoy had also said to Juddha earlier, \"Now we are facing problems in Hindustan for allowing other papers to publish.\" Juddha asked the writers to heed the suggestion of the British envoy and not be enthusiastic about publishing Sharada. But as Yadunath Khanal said, Juddha allowed the writers to publish a literary magazine named Sharada in the winter of 1934. That was a tacit agreement between the rulers and the writers. However, the reference to the British anxiety regarding freedom to publish newspapers and magazines is notable. That also shows how the literary writers kept up the spirit of freedom and creative thinking through such tacit agreements. It was possible only through literary expressions. Literary magazines also came into existence after the political turn of the 1950s and of the 1960s. The continuity of the literary magazines run by individual literary persons like Uttam Kunwar and Balmukunda Pandey's Roop-Rekha, Rochak Ghimire's Rachana, Nagendra Sharma's Abhivyakti, Achyutraman Adhikari's Unnayan and a few others are unforgettable milestones of Nepali literary journeys. A survey of similar icons of the literary times of other languages of Nepal would make the picture complete. Literary magazines have traversed the difficult but important terrains of awakenings in this land.  \nRecently, a 34-year-old male with a two-day history of fever, nausea, weakness and body aches was admitted to the emergency department of Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital in Kathmandu. His oxygen saturation (SpO2) was 95 percent on room air, and he tested positive for Covid-19. Covid-like illness is rising in the community, especially since the beginning of the monsoon season. It indicates that the disease itself might be circulating in Nepal. In fact, as per the World Health Organization (WHO) data, Nepal has observed a drastic increase in the SARS-CoV-2 virus, from 5.56 percent (week 28) to 13.68 percent (week 31) in a three week-interval (i.e., between July 8-14 and July 29-August 4). The variant responsible for the rapid increase of Covid infection rate in the community is unknown. Hence, it has been termed “monsoon covid” here.By the end of May 2024, Nepal had confirmed several Omicron sub-variants, including KP.1, KP.2, KP.3 and KP.4, also known as KP or “FLiRT” subvariants. Dozens of patients diagnosed with Covid-19 have been admitted to Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital since the beginning of March 2024. Most of the patients were aged 65 and above and required the intensive care unit. Until now, there is no evidence of an increase in hospitalisations due to monsoon covid. Nonetheless, it cannot be definitively ruled out that it may become severe in the upcoming days in Nepal. In the past, Nepal has typically experienced waves of Covid-19 following outbreaks in neighbouring India due to their shared border. Thus, we usually predict that when a Covid-19 outbreak occurs in India, Nepal will inevitably see a wave of Covid-19 after a couple of weeks or months. Nevertheless, this time, Nepal is observing monsoon covid before India, and it currently has the highest SARS-CoV-2 infection rate in the Southeast-Asian region. As per the WHO data, India has maintained a constant rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection over the past four weeks (between week-28 and week-31), and in fact, even decreasing trend to 0.73 percent (i.e., July 29- August 4) from 3.26 percent (week-28, i.e., July 8-14). It is uncertain whether the monsoon covid will hit India in the coming days, but it is not impossible. Fever, cough and shortness of breath are the main symptoms of Covid-19. However, the symptoms have varied over multiple waves with people exhibiting atypical symptoms like silent or happy hypoxia, loss of taste and smell and flu-like illness. Notably, the patient who visited STIDH did not have a cough and shortness of breath but exhibited a low platelet count, which is unusual in patients with Covid-19. Such a changing pattern of clinical symptoms of Covid-19 over the period is not surprising. The absence of cough, shortness of breath and the presence of thrombocytopenia (a low platelet count, i.e., 70,000 per microliter of blood) is a rare phenomenon and thus worthwhile to study further. More cases, however, are needed to fully comprehend the monsoon covid and its evolving symptoms. Viruses evolve over time, and become more or less severe. We can, therefore, expect Covid-19 to continue to evolve with more genetic mutations in the coming days. Unfortunately, are unaware of the increasing trends of monsoon covid in Nepal and its reasons. It is wise to identify mutations or analyse genetic sequencing to understand the resurgence of monsoon covid.As of now, the seasonality of Covid-19 is not well established in Nepal. However, there have always been peaks (small or big) of Covid-19 cases during or around August in the past. Based on past data, we can assume that Covid-19 can reappear during the monsoon season every year in Nepal. Then, the question arises: Can we consider Covid-19 a seasonal virus like the influenza virus in Nepal? It is unknown whether monsoon covid will cause an increase in hospitalisations in the coming days, as seen in March 2024, owing to KP or “FLiRT” subvariants. However, such a scenario should not be underestimated. Although vaccines against the virus are available, people are not interested in getting jabbed. Preventive measures also help to avoid it, but vaccines are still important. Continuous surveillance, genetic analysis and vaccination should be prioritised. \nThe Philippines has detected a new case of the mpox virus in the country, the first since December last year, its health department said on Monday, adding it was awaiting test results before being able to determine the strain.The patient was a 33-year-old Filipino male who had no travel history outside the Philippines, the Department of Health (DOH) said.“We are awaiting sequencing results and will update once available,” its spokesperson Albert Domingo said when asked about the strain.The World Health Organization on Wednesday declared mpox a global public health emergency, its highest form of alert, following an outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo that had spread to neighbouring countries.A new form of the virus has triggered global concern as it seems to spread easily through routine close contact.A case of the new variant was confirmed on Thursday in Sweden and linked to a growing outbreak in Africa, the first sign of its spread outside the continent. Pakistan on Friday confirmed at least one case of the mpox virus in a patient who had returned from a Gulf country, but said they did not yet know the strain of the virus.The new case in the Philippines is the 10th laboratory-confirmed case the health department has detected. Its first case was in July 2022.“Symptoms started more than a week ago with fever, which was followed four days later by findings of a distinct rash on the face, back, nape, trunk, groin, as well as palms and soles,” the Philippine DOH said in a statement.The disease, caused by the monkeypox virus, leads to flu-like symptoms and pus-filled lesions. It is usually mild but can kill, children, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV, all at higher risk of complications. \nUS Vice President Kamala Harris indirectly criticized former President Donald Trump on Sunday, suggesting her opponent in the November 5 election was a “coward” whose politics focused on putting down rivals.The remarks came in a campaign appearance in the critical battleground state of Pennsylvania with running mate Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, before Harris heads to the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, which kicks off Monday.“Over the last several years there’s been this kind of perversion that has taken place, I think, which is to suggest that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down. When what we know is the real and true measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up,” Harris told a crowd of supporters. “Anybody who’s about beating down other people is a coward.”She did not directly name Trump, who in a campaign appearance Saturday in eastern Pennsylvania referred to Harris as a “radical” and a “lunatic.”“There will be a lot that is about what I believe is a way forward, a new way forward, and bringing everyone along in that,” she told reporters outside a restaurant.Trump on Saturday said he believed she would be easier to beat than Biden, 81, who dropped out last month under pressure from his own party after a disastrous debate against Trump.Pennsylvania was one of three Rust Belt states, along with Wisconsin and Michigan, that helped power Republican Trump's upset victory in the 2016 election.Biden, who grew up in Scranton, Pennsylvania, flipped the trio back to the Democrats in 2020, and Harris aims to hold on to them.Sources said on Saturday that she is likely to join Biden on stage at the convention on Monday as he passes the torch to her as the party’s nominee for president.The Trump campaign will try to counter-program the convention with a series of swing-state events this week. He will visit a manufacturing facility in York, Pennsylvania, on Monday, where his campaign says he will focus on the economy, and a county sheriff's office in Howell, Michigan, on Tuesday to talk about safety and crime.Trump and his running mate, Senator JD Vance, will travel to Asheboro, North Carolina, on Wednesday for remarks on national security, and on Friday Trump will join Turning Point Action, a group founded by conservative activist Charlie Kirk, for a rally in Glendale, Arizona, aimed in part at highlighting efforts to boost turnout.Trump supporters said they hope he will refocus his campaign on policy rather than the repeated personal attacks against Harris he has leaned heavily on in the weeks since she emerged as the Democratic candidate.“President Trump can win this election. His policies are good for America and if you have a policy debate he wins. Donald Trump the provocateur, the showman, may not win this election,” Republican US Senator Lindsey Graham said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday. “Policy is the key to the White House.” \nOn Monday the weather is forecast to be generally cloudy throughout the country.Light to moderate rainfall with thunder and lightning at many places in Koshi, Bagmati, Gandaki, Lumbini, Karnali and Sudurpaschim provinces as well as a few places in Madhesh Province. There are chances of heavy rainfall in one or two places in all the provinces.Tonight the weather is forecast to be partly to generally cloudy throughout the country. There is a possibility of light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning at many places of Koshi, Bagmati, Gandaki, Lumbini, Karnali and Sudur Pashchim Province and some places of Madesh Province.The meteorological forecasting division has forecast chances of heavy rainfall at one or two places in the country.On Sunday Janakpur experienced the hottest temperature of 37.8 Degrees Celsius while Jomsom experienced the lowest temperature of 15.5 Degrees Celsius. \nMinister for Foreign Affairs Arzu Rana Deuba left for New Delhi on Sunday on a five-day India visit at the invitation of her Indian counterpart S Jaishankar.She left for the Indian Capital City at 11:30pm. Minister Rana was seen off at the Tribhuvan International Airport by Foreign Secretary Sewa Lamsal, among other senior foreign ministry officials.It is her first official trip after taking office on July 15. She is accompanied by Joint Secretary Bhrigu Dhungana, division chief of the South Asia Division at the foreign ministry, among others.During the visit, the foreign minister will hold a meeting with Jaishankar and discuss matters of mutual interest for further strengthening Nepal-India relations and promoting cooperation, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.The foreign minister’s visit comes a week after new Indian foreign secretary Vikram Misri concluded a two-day familiarisation visit to Nepal.She will also meet senior Bharatiya Janata Party leaders.Foreign Minister Rana will return home on Thursday. \nThe parliamentary special committee formed to investigate irregularities and misappropriation of cooperative funds on Sunday recorded the statement of Bipin Acharya, joint general secretary of the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP).Acharya, who was once the creative director at Gorkha Media Network, was interrogated at the committee’s secretariat in Singha Durbar.Acharya, along with RSP chairman Rabi Lamichhane, is alleged to have been involved in the misappropriation of funds from the cooperatives established under Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai.Documents revealed that a total of Rs25.6 million was provided to Gorkha Media, including Rs10 million from Suryadarshan Saving and Credit Cooperatives on 13 December 2021 and Rs15.5 million from Supreme Cooperatives on 27 December 2021. Acharya not only transferred the funds to Gorkha Media but also directed them to his own company via Gorkha Media.Gorkha Media reportedly transferred Rs53.5 million to Nobody Production Pvt Ltd, a company founded by Acharya’s wife, Surakshya Adhikari.‘Saregama Little Champs’, which aired 37 episodes on Galaxy TV, was funded by Supreme Cooperatives through payments to Nobody Production. \nCome autumn, Nepal will deploy heavy lifter drones to transport garbage from the 6,812-metre tall Ama Dablam, south of Everest. This will be the first commercial work an unmanned aerial vehicle does in Nepal’s high-altitude zone.The heavy lifter from China’s biggest drone maker, Da Jiang Innovations (DJI), will take on tasks traditionally handled by Sherpas. Officials believe it will help reduce casualties on Everest.Then, in spring (March-May), DJI drones, which make sounds similar to a swarm of bees, will be put to work on Everest.It will fly to Camp I (5,943 metres) to supply ropes and ladders to prepare routes and bring garbage to the Everest base camp at 5,364 metres.On Sunday, a tripartite memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed between the Sagarmatha Pollution Control Committee, the Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Rural Municipality, and the Airlift Technology Pvt Ltd for the use of advanced drone technology to efficiently manage garbage in the mountains of the Khumbu region.In April, Chinese drone maker DJI conducted the world’s first drone delivery test on Everest.“After a successful test in April, we plan to use drones commercially in the Everest region,” said Jagat Bhusal, chief administration officer of the rural municipality that hosts Everest. The test result showed that the DJI FlyCart 30, the long-distance heavy lifter drone, could airlift 234 kg per hour between Camp I and Base Camp, a task usually accomplished by at least 14 porters in six hours. Drone manufacturer DJI is under the microscope as US lawmakers push for a ban on Chinese drones, amid deteriorating relations between the US and China, the world’s largest trading nations.Nepali officials and mountaineers, however, see the drone as a life-saving vehicle.Traditionally, local Sherpa guides are responsible for transporting supplies and clearing trash on Everest. They may need to cross the icefall over 30 times a season to transport supplies such as oxygen bottles, gas canisters, tents, food, and ropes.All climbers and guides must navigate the icefall on the route to the world’s tallest peak. The icefall is so notoriously dangerous that even experienced Sherpas hesitate to move when the sun shines.The Khumbu Icefall, a river of ice a kilometre or so long, is usually crossed at night or early morning, with climbers putting headlamps on their helmets.Normally, the route is crossed early in the morning, when the ice blocks and the hanging glaciers are stable and avalanche risks are low.During the day, as the sun warms the mountain, the hanging glaciers melt, and ice crumbles, increasing the risk of avalanche.“Using drones will help us avoid the dangers in the Khumbu Icefall,” said Bhusal. On April 18, 2014, an avalanche resulting from a falling serac buried 16 Sherpa guides in the Khumbu Icefall, eventually leading to the cancellation of the season’s expeditions.Last year, three Sherpa guides mobilised to prepare the routes were buried under the ice masses triggered by an avalanche in the Khumbu Icefall. Their bodies are yet to be recovered.The Himalayan Database and the government records show that nearly 50 individuals died on the icefall between 1953 and 2023.The climb from Everest Base Camp to Camp I takes six hours. Between these two camps lies the Khumbu Icefall, the most treacherous part of the route.The most exciting and easiest part of the route is reaching Camp II (6,400 metres), which takes four hours from Camp I.There is a set of restrictions in the mountains for carrying loads.According to government rules, workers climbing high altitudes must not carry loads exceeding 20kg between 5,000 and 6,000 metres, 17 kg between 6,001 and 7,000 metres, 14 kg between 7,001 to 8,000 metres, and 12 kg for altitudes above 8,000 metres.“Yes, there are concerns that the machines may actually cut jobs. But our sole purpose is to reduce potential deaths in the Khumbu Icefall, the danger zone,” said Bhusal.“We will train Sherpas, as drone operators cannot handle tasks at the higher camps. In the future, all work will be done by Sherpas.” In the trial phase, the drone could lift 30 kg from Camp I. However, its performance dropped to 18 kg from Camp II. “Based on the MoU framework, we will soon sign a commercial agreement with the drone supplier,” said Bhusal. “The municipality will monitor all the activities.”The municipality has, so far, spent Rs800,000 on the trial. Climate change is melting snow and ice, exposing even more garbage and bodies that have been covered for decades on Everest. This waste pollutes the natural environment and poses a severe health risk to everyone who lives in the Everest watershed.Nearly 100 tonnes of garbage were collected during this spring climbing season from Everest and Lhotse, which share the same base camp.According to the Sagarmatha Pollution Control Committee (SPCC), 77.19 tonnes of waste was collected from the Everest base camp alone during the Spring 2024 climbing season. With 8-9 tonnes coming from the higher camps brought down by the expedition agencies, the SPCC collected 85 tonnes of waste this spring.The breakdown of collected waste shows burnable garbage at 27.99 tonnes, recyclable garbage at 7.51 tonnes, human waste at 27.53 tonnes, and kitchen waste at 14.15 tonnes. The Nepal Army also collected over 11 tonnes of garbage. In Spring 2023, the SPCC managed nearly 70 tonnes of waste from expedition groups.Insiders say the Everest Base Camp has become more luxurious, leading to an accumulation of people and garbage. Nearly 60,000 people trek to the Base Camp annually.Since 2015, the SPCC has enforced the 8 kg garbage rule, requiring every climber ascending the Everest base camp to return with at least 8 kg of garbage. Visitors to Everest must also pay a $4,000 garbage deposit, which is refunded if the person returns with 8 kg.Before this year’s climbing season, the Supreme Court issued a mandamus order directing the government to regulate the rising number of expeditions on the world’s tallest mountain.The court order followed frequent traffic jams and increasing trash on Everest, which has even been called the ‘world's highest garbage dump’.“Drones can replace helicopters as a relatively low-risk transport vehicle to supplement supplies on the plateau, which will greatly expand the application space of UAVs,” Cai Yong, a senior engineer at East China Normal University, told Xinhua, the state news agency of China, after the April test.In recent years, more electric drones have been used in agriculture and forestry, power line inspection, logistics, and emergency rescue, and each breakthrough will help save human and material resources and protect the safety of life and property, Jin Wei, deputy secretary-general of the China UAV Industry Innovation Alliance, told Xinhua.The April tests used the DJI FlyCart 30 to fly three bottles of oxygen and 1.5 kg of other supplies from the base camp to Camp I of the world's highest peak and to carry garbage down on the return trip.During the tests, the DJI FlyCart 30 flew up to 6,191.8 metres on Everest, which straddles the Nepal-China border.  \nIn Nepali Congress, the position of general secretary is considered the second most powerful after the party president.Historically, some charismatic leaders have held the position in the country’s grand old party: from Krishna Prasad Bhattarai in the 1950s, to Mahendra Narayan Nidhi, Girija Prasad Koirala, to now the duo of Gagan Thapa and Bishwa Prakash Sharma.When two relatively younger and popular leaders—Thapa and Sharma—got elected as general secretaries in December 2021, they had kindled hope among young Congress members and well-wishers of the party.But over time, they have failed to implement their agendas as the establishment led by party chief Deuba is dominant. Political analysts and observers, too, say that Thapa and Sharma have failed to reflect the strength of their popular mandate in the party decision making process.Prior to its 14th general convention, the party had the provision of one elected general secretary whereas the other was nominated by the party President after the general convention. In the last convention, the party amended its statute and made it mandatory to elect both the general secretaries and other party bearers through voting.With Thapa and Sharma elected as the Congress general secretaries, they were expected to challenge the septuagenarian party President Sher Bahadur Deuba.However, as a party insider claims, the general secretary duo themselves are struggling to create their space in party leadership. This struggle is a testament to the challenges they face in cementing their influence in the Congress, says a party leader.“The party’s general secretary is usually occupied with official work,” Prakash Sharan Mahat, a Congress spokesperson, told the Post. “How active they are in the party’s internal affairs is not something I can comment on.”After being elected as the party’s general secretaries, Thapa and Sharma have publicly spoken about being kept in the dark on vital matters. For instance, while speaking at the 42nd BP Memorial programme held on July 20, Thapa said the July 1 agreement between Congress and CPN-UML reached to form a new coalition government came as a surprise.Purushottam Dahal, a senior journalist close to the Congress, says the two general secretaries didn’t understand their exact role.“The general secretary’s role is to make the party’s central secretariat functional, but they are trying to be reactionary, which is inappropriate,” Dahal told the Post. “To make the party functional, they should not wait for a green signal from the party president.”However, General Secretary Sharma rubbishes such a claim.“There have been some transformative changes in the party after we assumed the role of general secretaries,” Sharma told the Post. “From establishing a library in the party’s central office to holding the BP Koirala Literature Festival, we have made the party more vibrant.”He argued that what has happened is that the duo have failed to publicise some of their important works.The general secretaries claim they are facing difficulties because of the party leadership’s working style, but some leaders don’t buy that argument.Sharma further claims that their work is often hindered by the generational gap with Deuba.“In addition, both of us general secretaries were elected from different panels during the general convention, which caused some misunderstanding among party leaders,” Sharma said.But there are other Congress leaders who accuse the general secretaries of suddenly turning risk-averse. “They are bound by the party statute as the party follows a presidential system where the president prevails over others,” Govinda Pokharel, a newly appointed head of the Economic Policy and Planning Department of the Congress, told the Post. “However, the two general secretaries cannot accommodate all groups in the party, and hence their difficulties.” According to Pokharel, after becoming the party’s office bearers, they are slowly turning cautious. “Although they have a very popular base and they also have content-based knowledge on development, they are not being able to use their potential.” Sharma differs.“We have challenged the party leadership on many issues to establish our agenda,” Sharma said. “At the party’s Mahasamiti meeting in February, we successfully proposed contesting the upcoming election with the party’s own strength… The party's central committee meeting, which will commence on Wednesday, will pass our proposal as it is.” A Congress leader close to General Secretary Thapa, however, acknowledged that Thapa is sometimes clueless about the party’s functioning.“From the beginning, the general secretaries have not been able to mobilise the leaders in their fold effectively,” Shankar Tiwari, a Congress youth leader close to Thapa, told the Post. “Sometimes they prevail over the party president, but on many other occasions they are also at his mercy.”Meanwhile, a few Congress leaders claim that the popularity of the general secretaries duo is diminishing, which could make it difficult for them to elevate themselves in party politics in the coming days. There are ample examples where Congress leaders lost their revolutionary spirit after becoming general secretary, says the leader.Only three past general secretaries of Congress have succeeded in becoming party chief and the prime minister. Krishna Prasad Bhattarai was the general secretary of the party soon after the establishment of democracy in Nepal in 1950. Likewise, Girija Prasad Koirala, another general secretary during the 1990s, later became the prime minister as well as the party President. Sushil Koirala was the third general secretary to become party president, and the prime minister. Jagat Nepal, a long-time Congress observer, says that apart from the prime minister, two of the Congress’s general secretaries have become the country’s President, if not party president and prime minister. “Ram Baran Yadav, the first President of the country, and Ramchandra Paudel, the current President, both were once the party’s general secretary,” Nepal told the Post. Besides, Taranath Ranabhat, the former general secretary of the party, and Paudel became Speakers of the House of Representatives in the 1990s.Nepal added that despite not being elevated to the party’s top position, a few former general secretaries of Congress had played an important role in national politics. “We can’t draw a sweeping conclusion that leaders lose their influence after becoming general secretary,” he said.Apart from the leaders mentioned above, Mahendra Narayan Nidhi, Krishna Prasad Sitaula, Prakash Man Singh, Sashank Koirala, and Purna Bahadur Khadka were the few among others who took up the responsibility of the general secretary.“As far as why they were not able to lift themselves to the top position is concerned, sometimes, despite their personal efficiency, circumstances might not be favourable,” Dahal, the senior journalist, said.General Secretary Sharma echoes Dahal.In the past, the party president used to nominate one of the two general secretaries. In such a case, the nominated general secretary would obviously not be able to challenge the party chief, Sharma said. From the 14th general convention, the party started to elect both general secretaries through voting by party delegates. \nAjaya Dixit’s current work focuses on studying challenges of building resilience across boundaries and at sub-national scales. He has studied and written extensively on water resources, trans-boundary water cooperation, flood management, wash services and climate change adaptation, clean energy transition and related policy studies. In this interview with the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal, Dixit discusses river management in Nepal’s urban areas: Where have we gone wrong in this endeavour and what can we do? You have extensively studied river systems and have been following changes seen in river basins. How do you see recent problems caused by encroachment and rampant development activities?We humans have lived and have to continue to live within water cycles: water evaporates from the ocean to the sky and then precipitates to the land and flows via rivers back to the ocean. Rivers that function as arteries of the land surface, sustaining humans, aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems face widespread abuses: pollution, rampant extraction of their bed and banks, fragmentation and degradation. Without rivers, we would not be who we are. Unfortunately, we have forgotten this essence. We neglect and abuse rivers. In 1981, just after the monsoon ended, I, along with my students, walked from Sundarijal to Teku studying Bagmati rivers’ sediment. At many places, we walked on the riverbed. The river then was clean. Gradually, the river systems began to face all-round decay. I have read painful accounts of my contemporaries who remember swimming in the clean Bagmati and its tributaries. In less than 50 years, our rivers in Kathmandu Valley and other basins no longer look like rivers. I feel helpless and ache with pain at this collective failure! What state of rivers are we passing on to our next generation?River encroachment is common across Nepal but more serious in urban areas, including in Kathmandu. How can this be stopped?Our approach to rivers is an imitation of the trend common across South Asia, or the subcontinent, which is again largely based on the knowledge system developed in the industrialised Global North without contextualising locally. The region features waterscapes of high and punctuated rainfall during the monsoon months, rivers, wetlands, ponds, and springs, all connected with groundwater aquifers in one of the most complex landscapes of the world: the Himalaya-Ganga region. Yet, current development endeavours subjugate water rather than respect and live with it. In 2022, the Indus River in Pakistan faced major floods with devastating consequences. Referring to these floods, a group of global scientists stated that “the impacts [of the floods] were the outcome of an outdated river management system.” This approach is primarily based on building of physical structures such as buildings, bridges and roads close to rivers interfering with their natural flows. The approach that began in the early twentieth century keeps marching on even while we are facing twenty first century water challenges.There is an increasing trend of building corridor roads along the rivers in Kathmandu as well as other places. Is this a good or bad practice? In Nepal, road building in the hills has earned the sobriquet of “dozer roads,” meaning politically designed roads excavated by heavy machine operators without adhering to basic engineering, social, environmental, or hydrological safeguards. Even highways built with “engineering,” such as the Mugling-Narayanghat section, face regular accidents. The sliding of the two buses in the Trishuli is the recent example. Building roads along the banks of rivers, defined as “river corridors,” is the preferred approach for improving connectivity. In the Kathmandu Valley, this is also associated with rivers shackled within concrete walls in the name of river beautification. In the monsoon, however, they all overflow as we have been seeing in the last few years and this year as well.What will happen to these rivers 10-15 years down the line? Is there any chance of some of our rivers dying? Or, will the measures taken in recent times protect them?All rivers must flow clean and free in selected stretches. But today, rivers are disconnected with their floodplains. Within walls and embankments, they have become conduits of filth. Many rivers are already seriously degraded. If the current trend continues, many rivers may die. I remember Jacques-Yves Cousteau, the French oceanographer, filmmaker, and author, who wrote: “Water and air, the two essential fluids on which all life depends, have become global garbage cans.” Our current efforts at conserving, developing and managing rivers are grossly inadequate. During the Covid-19 pandemic, we saw some rivers heal as human actions across the board ceased due to the lockdown. But this healing came at huge human and economic costs. The lessons, however, are clear. We must stop turning rivers into garbage cans for them to begin to heal. The onus lies on us, our activities, our governance, and the policies we make and put into practice effectively. We need new ways of imagining rivers in harmony with human needs. Otherwise, the rivers will die. If rivers die, what will become of us?What problems may city dwellers face as a result of this continued destruction of rivers?A 2020 analysis of rivers in Nepal found that the quality of rivers in the mid-hills and the Tarai are already deteriorating. Industries, cities, towns, and agriculture produce waste that, when disposed of in rivers untreated, cause pollution. Solid and liquid wastes produced by expanding cities and towns pollute nearby rivers, streams, and water bodies. Pollution kills aquatic life such as fish, which are sources of livelihood for many communities. Polluted rivers and water bodies degrade human and environmental health, leading to negative impacts on human livelihoods. The impacts of pollution on rivers are considerable during non-monsoon months when river discharge, and consequently the capacity of rivers to dilute waste, are low.What should be done to conserve the rivers, at least in the present form, and stop further damages?All rivers are a combination of water (W), energy (E), biodiversity aquatic (B), and sediment (S), represented by the acronym WEBS. In the current scheme of things, the focus is on water and energy. Aquatic ecosystems are the concern of only those working on freshwater ecosystems. They are neglected in the larger context though the state has made some provisions for conserving ecosystems. In Nepal’s Hydropower Development Policy of 2001 all hydropower plants must release 10 percent minimum flow to the downstream reaches to enable fish and other aquatic life to survive in the river. A 2021 study of 50 hydropower plants however found that none of the plants surveyed release environmental-flows. All hydropower plants, as per their power purchasing agreements, are required to produce maximum power during the dry season. We should start by accepting the fact that rivers need clean flowing water and respecting the policies we have made. Then we must systematically introduce changes and avoid the oversights embedded in the present approach. The present approach to water development and management focused on engineering and structural solutions is based on single-disciplinary education that is blind to gender and social inclusion challenges and aquatic ecosystems. In the present approach, nobody seems to want sediment which is a natural consequence of flow within the water cycle.To meet such an objective, we need to begin with a system of integrated knowledge that synthesises natural science, social science, and indigenous practices. By incorporating fields such as hydrology, ecology, social science-supported context-specific engineering, and indigenous knowledge and practices, we can take a comprehensive approach to water management challenges and solutions. Interdisciplinary approaches can build collaboration, innovation, and systemic decision-making and promote innovative water management for the benefit of both ecosystems and human societies.Do you think initiatives such as river clean up campaigns run by various groups help protect these waterways?I see such initiatives as manifestation of dissatisfaction of concerned citizens with the degradation of rivers and to bring about changes. In 1990, I was part of the Save Bagmati Campaign, which aimed to highlight the degrading state of the river. This campaign has taken many new forms, and citizen groups have begun campaigns in other rivers of Nepal. They however remain fragmented and ad-hoc. Similar campaigns in some countries have led to granting rights to rivers. In 2017, New Zealand recognised the Whanganui River and its tributaries as legal entities, acknowledging their physical and spiritual significance as “living and indivisible” and ensuring their survival, health, and integrity to balance the needs of humans and nature. Promulgations like Living Indus (Pakistan), Namami Gange river-improvement programme (India) can offer lessons for a holistic water journey. The collective voice of concerned citizens for the integrity of rivers can be a powerful medium for policy and pathway changes. Nepal must also begin country-wide river restoration initiatives. We need more dialogue and conversation around water challenges and solutions.As cities turn into concrete jungles, their water tables are said to be receding alarmingly. You often propose redesigning our settlements and development infrastructure in a way that wouldn’t disturb rivers’ natural courses and catchment areas. Could you elaborate?South Asia is a region of waterscapes containing streams, ponds, wetlands, open spaces, floodplains, springs, and underground aquifers. Yet, our towns, cities, and infrastructure are planned, designed, and built to disregard water rather than live with it. As land-centric urban growth dominates, waterscapes temporarily seem to vanish but later water comes back. In Nepali we have a saying “In twelve years a stream returns”. The present practice of urban development is obsessed with concretisation, making these areas impermeable. Rainwater, part of which would naturally infiltrate the ground, now immediately reaches the rivers already constrained by walls. The river at a downstream section immediately peaks and when the rainfall stops the river has very low discharge. Basic parameters, like the intensity of rainfall (mm per hour), are poorly recognised and used in design guidelines. The interaction of current urbanisation practices and increasing extreme rainfall, temperature and humidity rise spawned by climate change and urban heat island effects will make our urban areas as crucible of hazards, and unhealthy. A new urban future must harmoniously integrate nature, including water bodies and wetlands, and preserve natural land cover, including traditional ponds to promote groundwater recharge. It can be further achieved by preserving green open spaces, forests, gardens, permeable “sponge” pavements, and natural waterfronts for healthier communities in sustainable cities. The starting point will be recognising cities as waterscapes. Amplified mitigation of emissions of greenhouse gases at global levels remains a critical imperative in this new future. The major impacts of climate change are evident through the water cycle. Squatters settled along the riverbanks are taken as one of the major headaches in preserving rivers’ catchment areas. How can this issue be resolved?The squatters and migrants to urban regions are outcomes of the present-day political economy of development. People move to cities seeking livelihood, education, and opportunities to move up the social ladder. These groups who end up living in high-risk areas are sometimes also seen as political vote banks. This issue needs to be viewed within the larger development question including generation of local employment, new livelihood opportunities and addressing insecurities of water, food, health, and education.Recently the Supreme Court asked authorities to make septic tank and soak pit mandatory while approving building designs in order to help recharge groundwater, and a recent Cabinet meeting has banned building any structure within 40 metres on both sides of major rivers in Kathmandu, Do such measures help keep the rivers alive or is that too little too late?Such decisions, in some way, seem to underscore the notion of giving space to rivers and maintaining their integrity. Building of septic tanks as part and parcel of new houses began in the 1970s as primary treatment units that can prevent the direct dumping of human waste into rivers and water bodies. The regular cleaning and safe disposal of waste from septic tanks are emerging questions. Rivers and waterscapes face much deeper challenges, however. The present water development model marches on like a mighty tusker, trampling in its path communities, villagers, residents, natural ecosystems, the terrestrial and aquatic beings, and past memories. Turning that around will require those working on water and river integrity across geographical, social, disciplinary and political boundaries to join hands in seeking changes and laying the foundation for a new ethical social contract for rivers and waterscapes as a first step in that long journey. \nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nMost economists believe spending on infrastructure has a significant multiplier effect. During the construction phase, infrastructure generates real cash flow for workers and their families. In the long run, it has a direct and indirect impact on the economy, with a multiplier effect, particularly in job creation.In Rupandehi, which hosts the industrial city Bhairahawa, and Lumbini, a landmark of the Buddhist world listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1997, infrastructure built with a sizeable investment has gone to waste.Big infrastructure projects like the international convention centre, meditation centre, industrial zones, and Gautam Buddha International Airport have failed to generate income and have turned into veritable white elephants.Nature has started reclaiming most of the under-utilised infrastructure.Since 2010, talk of building an international airport led to the construction of large-scale infrastructure, including a bevy of luxury hotels.Proliferating factories and a rapidly spreading transport network turned the Butwal-Bhairahawa metroplex into an economic powerhouse.Nepal opened its second international airport in May 2022 in the southern city of Bhairahawa, but no international flight stops there right now.The objective of building an international airport in Bhairahawa was to bring in more tourists, energise businesses and create jobs. But the situation is just the opposite. Traders are closing down their shops and moving abroad for decent jobs.The private sector, too, invested heavily. When the finished project started to sit idle, it hit the sector, and many enterprises were teetering into bankruptcy.Economists term this development in Lumbini a cascading failure—a breakdown in a system of interconnected parts in which the failure of one or few parts leads to the failure of other parts. Hem Raj Regmi, deputy chief statistician and data curator at the National Statistics Office, said Lumbini province saw heavy investment from the government and the private sector, but the output has slowed. “Enterprises are unable to raise even the operating cost.”In the last fiscal year, Lumbini province was estimated to grow at 4.05 percent to a GDP of Rs814 billion, from the low base of the 1.99 percent growth it had achieved in the previous fiscal year. Lumbini is estimated to contribute 14.26 percent to the national GDP. The highest value-added growth rate in Lumbini was in electricity and gas, which grew by 28.93 percent, while the manufacturing sector was estimated to shrink by a negative 1.43 percent in the last fiscal year.Most completed infrastructures in Lumbini have become white elephants, as their expenditures have been growing instead of them generating income. The Butwal International Convention Center, built with an investment of Rs1.11 billion in ward 10 of Butwal Sub Metropolis, is currently without business. The centre has 13 halls, each with a capacity to accommodate 2,700 people. The auditorium is the largest of the 13.The government built the convention centre to organise national and international conferences and events, but it is not generating much income. Construction started in 2014 and the centre was inaugurated in August 2022.Officials say that the centre is struggling to pay its staff. While the centre is under-utilised and lacks maintenance, bushes have grown around it.Dharmendra Panthi, chief of the Butwal International Convention Center project, said 22 events or functions have been conducted in the past three years, earning Rs4 million. The centre is currently closed as the provincial cabinet is yet to pass the operating guidelines even in three years.However, Panthi said they have been occasionally renting the hall on request. The centre charges Rs96,000 for a day-long event.Prabin Pathak, president of the Nepal Hoteliers Association, who took part in a recent function at the convention centre, said the infrastructure is in a sorry state due to lack of periodic maintenance.“If the building is not utilised properly, it will be a waste of tax money,” said Pathak. “The washroom faucets are dry, and it is difficult to sit in the hall due to the stench from the washroom.”“In Nepal, there is a growing trend of building new infrastructure, but their upkeep is often ignored. This is sad,” Pathak said. “No one is accountable for the losses the projects incur. Similarly, questions are raised about the quality of construction. In most projects, low-quality materials are used, severely compromising the structural integrity.”A hall with a capacity to accommodate 5,000 people built near the Buddha’s birthplace, Lumbini, has yet to do any business, except hosting a few functions. It was built with an investment of Rs720 million.Sanuraja Shakya, member-secretary of the Lumbini Development Trust, said that if a social organisation wants to conduct a function at the centre, they have to pay a fee.Shakya said that since it is a meditation centre, they do not allow other functions, especially those involving entertainment.Questions were raised about the construction when the roof started leaking soon after project’s completion. It was repaired later.Likewise, the Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in Bhairahawa, has not been fully operational for a long time. As factories have not been set up in the SEZ, the area has turned into a jungle. Construction of the SEZ had started in 2003 and it was inaugurated in 2014.Located in south-central Nepal, the Bhairahawa Special Economic Zone has 69 industrial plots of sizes from 1,400 to 3,700 square metres. A few industrialists have booked plots, but have not set up their plants as the government has failed to provide pledged services and amenities. The government had promised to provide 24-hour electricity, a one-stop service system, customs, banks, and insurance among other things inside the SEZ.“Every year, new entrepreneurs book plots, but do not set up their factories due to associated tough conditions,” said Saput Dumre, assistant director of SEZ. Dumre said industrialists are concerned about the mandatory export provision. According to SEZ guidelines, which were amended three months ago, firms that lease space inside the SEZ must export at least 30 percent of manufactured goods. “There is a water tank in the SEZ, but it has no water, the weighing machine does not work, the petrol pump is defunct, there are no parking areas, and the road is covered in thick bushes,” said Ujjwal Prasad Kasaju, a central member of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry. Then there is the new Gautam Buddha International Airport—all dressed up, and nowhere to go. The airport awaits applications for flight slots from international airlines after more than two years of opening.Nepal's second international airport was ready after ten years and nearly Rs40 billion pumped into the project, but despite the build-up, the expected rush of eager carriers is nowhere to be seen.The airport is a landmark located in south central Nepal and spread over 787 bighas (533 hectares).The modern facility has a 15,169-square-metre terminal building that can serve nearly a million passengers a year. The airport's 3,000-metre runway is long enough to handle the largest commercial jets. However, no commercial jet wants to fly to the airport. \nKunwar has been the MD for just under three years. Before coming back to her homeland to join Daraz Nepal, she worked at different American companies, including Amazon, the world’s biggest e-commerce platform.

At the meeting, Sharma asked Dahal to step down as party chairman. Dahal has led the party uninterruptedly for over three-and-a-half decades.At the end of the standing committee meeting, leaders had said that the differences between Dahal and Sharma were resolved. But that conclusion seems premature. The two were busy accusing and criticising each other at a public function in Kathmandu. Dahal had to pacify Sharma on Saturday as he complained of not being trusted by Dahal and other Maoist leaders. “When I was assigned to build an alliance with the CPN-UML, I worked for the same but was tagged as KP Oli’s man,” Sharma said at the function. Later, the Maoist Centre decided to ally with the Nepali Congress, and he worked for the same as directed by Dahal, Sharma claimed. “But I was dubbed Sher Bahadur Deuba’s man. When will I be called the Maoist party’s man? When will you call me Prachanda’s man?” said Sharma, pointing to Dahal, who was sitting at the same podium as the chief guest.Taken aback, Dahal seemed to be consoling Sharma saying that comrade Prabhakar [Sharma] would never split the party, contrary to some media reports.Dahal rubbished reports that Sharma was trying to split the party as baseless and that the days-long standing committee meeting had dispelled all rumours.The Maoist party chief and former prime minister, however, admitted that there were still some confusions and that the meeting had decided to look into the matter and make things clear and resolve them with joint effort.Soon after the party was out of the government, it called the meetings of the standing committee and the secretariat and discussed the Maoist CEntre's future course, including unity with other fringe parties, strengthening the Socialist Front, and building the party’s organisation.“There were some matters of serious suspicion and some still exist. And the meeting has decided to study and find how such a situation of suspicion emerged,” Dahal said. The Maoist leader promised to study the issue jointly with Sharma and, if needed, the party may form a probe committee.“We have reached an understanding to properly address the remaining concerns as well,” Dahal added.Sharma is not alone in demanding that Dahal handover the party’s reins.Even Maoist Centre senior vice-chair Narayan Kaji Shrestha has asked Dahal to quit the leadership position. A large number of Maoist leaders at the central as well as lower committees want to see an overhaul of the party, said a central member.“If we fail to transform the party, there will be no hope for us besides surrendering to other parties in the 2027 elections,” the leader said.Another central committee member however doesn’t trust Dahal to build the party organisation. “Dahal would rather forge unity with other left parties and, if possible, explore options to contest the upcoming elections jointly with CPN-UML, the country’s largest communist party,” said the central member.The leader said he was unsure if the ruling UML would turn down Dahal’s proposal to join hands once again. According to him, Dahal’s strategy is to bring together left-leaning parties and put pressure on the UML, which leads the government with the backing of the Nepali Congress, to make an electoral alliance with the Maoists. The leader argues that the UML is preparing itself internally to contest the elections on its own, without allying with anyone.“This is the beginning of an infighting in the Maoist Centre because we abandoned the agenda of strengthening the federal, republican and secular Nepal,” said Ram Karki, secretary of the Maoist Centre. “This tussle is unlikely to stop anytime soon.”Because the conflict emerged under Dahal’s ‘schooling’, Karki claimed.He recalled that Mohan Baidya, who supported Dahal’s school of thought, engaged in a similar tussle before leaving the party. That conflict did not subside but intensified, leading Baidya to finally split the party, Karki observed.Later, Baburam Bhattarai, who also emerged allegedly from Dahal’s schooling, led a similar revolt, Karki recalled. “He also deserted the party. This time, too, the tussle has surfaced among those schooled under Dahal, so no one knows the outcome,” said Karki.For decades, Sharma remained a close confidant of Dahal. But he grew up to be a dissident after Dahal refused to appoint him the general secretary last year. Another deputy general secretary, Barsha Man Pun, was also an aspirant for the post of general secretary.Sharma and Pun are taken as Dahal’s lieutenants, right from the launch of the Maoist insurgency in 1996. Sidelining both during the 2022 party general convention, Dahal picked Dev Gurung, who had little influence in the party.Karki described the Congress-UML alliance’s move to oust the Maoist Centre from the government as a good opportunity to strengthen the Maoist party.“If the Nepali Congress and the UML hadn’t ejected our party from the government, we would have been finished by the time of next elections,” said Karki. “As we have been removed from power three years ahead of the election, there is some room for transformation.”Senior party leaders have given Dahal two options: transform himself and the party or vacate the chair that he has been occupying for over 35 years.Another central committee member said that if the conflict was an internal matter and the fight genuine, the party would emerge unscathed. “Otherwise, if external factors are working within the party, then the party will face a serious crisis,” said the leader.However, some Maoist leaders are confident that the party will not face a grave crisis. “Janardan ji questioned the party leadership. Isn’t that a good practice in the party?” said Yubaraj Chaulagain, a central committee member. “However, Chairman Dahal is addressing them.”Chaulagain said that the party leadership would collect reports from the party’s provincial committees and sister organisations and take the right decision based on them. “There’s the proposal for the party’s transformation. It will be discussed. We will gather more feedback and ideas from the lower committees, and follow them,” said Chaulagain. “Gradually, we will address the issues raised by Janardan ji.” \nCPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who has been leading the party for over three-and-a-half decades, has yet again pacified the leaders who want him to hand over the leadership.Janardan Sharma and Barsha Man Pun—deputy general secretaries of the Maoist party—had demanded that Dahal hand over the party leadership to a leader of their generation. The two leaders raised the issue during the standing committee meeting that commenced on August 9.Leaders concluded the meeting on Thursday as they decided to strengthen the Maoist party through internal dialogue between the leaders on their disagreements.Party secretary Ram Karki said that responding to the questions raised during the standing committee meeting on August 10, party chair Dahal vowed to address their issues.The party will resolve the theoretical as well as ideological differences among the party leaders through dialogue, Karki told the Post, quoting Dahal.On August 9, the first day of the meeting, the Maoist chair presented a verbal proposal on current political affairs, party building, and other pertinent issues.After Dahal’s presentation, some leaders raised questions about the party’s policies and leadership. Among them, Janardan Sharma, a deputy general secretary, submitted a written proposal on August 10, calling for a review of Dahal’s leadership and suggesting that the party chair be limited to a ceremonial role as patron.In his document, Sharma alleged, among other things, that the party leadership was trying to use state power against him.In the 14-page document submitted to the meeting, Sharma accused the party leadership of ‘spreading disinformation’ about him and the other deputy general secretary, Pun. He also accused the top leaders of even misusing state power against him.“The fake information about the party split, which was generated from Khumaltar [the private residence of Dahal], spread widely after reaching Baluwatar [the prime minister’s official residence where Dahal was staying until last month when the government changed],” Sharma questions the party leadership in his document. “There are questions: why did the leadership disseminate fake information?”However, Maoist Centre leaders said the issue has been settled, for now, after Dahal pledged to resolve it through intra-party discussions.Party chair Dahal, while speaking to the press briefly after the conclusion of the standing committee meeting on Thursday, said the reports and rumours about party split were baseless.“Rumours related to the party split led by comrade Prabhakar [Janardan Sharma] are baseless,” Dahal told journalists.The meeting also decided to hold consultative meetings at the provincial level, where the party's office bearers will also participate. After the meeting, the party will call for a full-fledged meeting of the central committee in mid-September (Ashoj first week).Another party secretary, Devendra Paudel, said the upcoming central committee meeting will call the party's special general convention, as decided during the eigth general convention held in 2022.But Lilamani Pokharel, a party secretary, says no decision was taken with regard to convening a special general convention as only the central committee has a mandate to call a special general convention, the supreme body of a party that can take final decisions on the party’s policies and leadership.“The party will go for a special general convention only if a central committee meeting decides to go for that,” Pokharel told the Post.After the party was out of the government in mid-July, calls for Dahal to relinquish the top position have grown. Haribol Gajurel, a close aide of Dahal and deputy general secretary, also raised the issue of leadership change during a meeting of party officials before the standing committee meeting and demanded a special congress to address the issues.Gajurel proposed that all office-bearers should resign and make a fresh start to rejuvenate the party. He even submitted his own resignation as a starting point. Following this, on the second day of the standing committee meeting held on August 10, Deputy General Secretary Sharma questioned the central leadership in his political paper.However, party spokesperson Agni Sapkota, who is close to Dahal, argued that the questions raised by Sharma were aimed at strengthening the party. “The issue I raised during the standing committee meeting was for the betterment of the party and to strengthen the leadership of Dahal,” Sapkota quoted Sharma as saying.“The party leadership has also taken the issue raised by the standing committee members, including deputy general secretary Gajurel, Sharma, and Barshaman Pun, on a positive note.”During Dahal's tenure as prime minister, Gajurel, his political adviser, had previously expressed dissatisfaction with the party's lack of adherence to procedures and methods. As questions arose about the central leadership of the Maoist Centre, which is focused on organisational development, Dahal found himself in a defensive position during the standing committee meeting. According to party insiders, it was after a long time that Dahal faced tremendous pressure during a standing committee meeting as both Sharma and Pun, who have strong command in the party organisation, stood together to demand Dahal’s exit from the party leadership. It was something unusual for Maoist leaders as the two leaders, who defended Dahal in the past, joined hands by closing their ranks to fiercely criticise the party chief. Sharma and Pun, both former finance ministers, are deemed the two most powerful leaders after Dahal.Both leaders claimed the position of general secretary at the party’s general convention in early 2022. Though they were willing to contest for the post, Dahal instead chose Dev Gurung as the general secretary. After the general convention, Sharma has been maintaining a distance from Dahal and he challenges the party chief on various occasions. Of late, Pun, too, has joined Sharma to challenge Dahal. At the standing committee meeting, Pun said there should be a debate on the party's chairperson's term limit. \"Instead of discussing whether the leader should step down now, we need to determine the chair’s term limit,\" he added. Leaders said Dahal faced a pressure of this scale in a party meeting probably for the first time in nearly a decade, since the exit of key leaders Baburam Bhattarai and Mohan Baidya. Bhattarai and Baidya lead their own parties now. \nForeign Minister Arzu Rana is set to visit India from August 18-21, on her first official trip after taking office.The visit by the foreign minister comes a week after new Indian foreign secretary Vikram Misri concluded a two–day familiarisation visit to Nepal just this week. During her time in India, according to the foreign ministry officials, Rana will hold talks with her Indian counterpart S Jaishankar and other officials and discuss several issues of mutual interests.Separate requests have been sent for meetings with Indian PresidentDroupadi Murmu and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, with confirmation still pending, according to foreign ministry officials privy to the visit preparations. She will also meet senior Bharatiya Janata Party leaders.“We are waiting for confirmation for both the meetings as Prime Minister KP Oli is keen to host Indian Prime Minister Modi in Nepal,” an official said. “It is the Indian prime minister's turn to visit Nepal, so our focus would be on making that visit happen,” the official said. Rana was planning to visit Delhi for a routine health checkup, but after India expressed interest in turning it into an official visit, she received an invitation from her Indian counterpart, Jaishankar, sources at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.Rana and Jaishankar are scheduled to meet in New Delhi on Monday to discuss issues from the seventh joint commission meeting in Kathmandu earlier this year, according to the officials.The Joint Commission meeting reviewed all aspects of bilateral relations and areas of cooperation including connectivity, infrastructure development, economic partnership, trade, transit, investment, power, water resources, culture, tourism, sports, health and education.During her meeting with Misri on Monday, Rana requested additional air routes to Nepal to increase air connectivity between Nepal and India, setting up a sophisticated laboratory at the Nepal-India border to test the quality of the vegetables and fruits imported from India for pesticides, expediting the negotiations for the finalisation of the detailed project report of the Pancheshwar Multipurpose Project that remains in limbo for years. They also discussed issues such as discharging the water from the Tanakpur canal, river training in the Banganga, Khado, and Rapti rivers with Indian assistance, and the inauguration of the suspension bridge in Darchula linking Nepal and India, according to the foreign ministry statement. The upcoming visit is expected to focus on discussing matters of mutual interest rather than signing understandings or agreements, a joint secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the Post. \nA parliamentary committee debates the inclusion and duration of a statute of limitations in corruption cases in Nepal, with disagreements among parties and concerns over potential loopholes for powerful individuals.\nKathmandu City expanded its building ban along rivers from 20 to 40 meters, halting ongoing construction and prohibiting water pollution under Supreme Court orders.\nAfter a century-long hiatus, the Lakhe dance is being revived in Bhaktapur by young dancers, conserving cultural heritage, fostering community, and potentially boosting tourism.\nLions Club Nepal felicitated individuals and businesses for their social contributions; from journalists to celebrities, and corporates to bureaucrats.\nKathmandu Valley to observe public holiday on Sunday for Bhoto Jatra, an annual religious festival celebrating the God of rain, Machhindranath, with a chariot-pulling finale in Lalitpur.\nIn Kathmandu, where construction dust often clouds the air, the resumption of the pavement widening project at New Road on July 17 has elicited mixed reactions. While some citizens harbour doubts and disagreements, people with disabilities have their fingers crossed as well. For Narayani Dawadi, who is visually impaired, the initiative offers hope and apprehension in equal measures. She worries that the Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) might overlook the parameters for disabled-friendly infrastructure and execute the project superficially.Dawadi’s scepticism is not unwarranted. Her distrust stems from her 20 years of experience navigating Kathmandu, where she has become familiar with its footpaths and pavements. Despite this familiarity, she cannot navigate confidently due to the ever-changing, unpredictable condition of the pavements.“I don’t know if I can call the footpaths accessible,” Dawadi says. “There is tactile paving for white cane users but it’s not perfect. Sometimes they guide us to a pole or a tree, and in many places, there are only partial tactile guides, leaving us confused.”Her experience highlights a recurring issue: lack of a reliable, consistent infrastructure for people with disabilities in Kathmandu.The roads and footpaths that appear fine during the day are often damaged or under-construction by the evening, giving people with disabilities a hard time navigating them.Dawadi isn’t entirely critical; she appreciates the KMC’s sidewalk widening projects and regulations on street vending and parking. Areas like Baneshwar have become much easier to navigate, Dawadi says.However, Dawadi hopes the KMC doesn’t just displace street vendors without providing alternatives. “They need options that won’t affect their income; a crackdown won’t work.”Dawadi emphasises that KMC shouldn’t view current projects as a complete solution to make public infrastructure ‘disabled-friendly.’ Issues like half-finished tactile paving, narrow roads, and misplaced poles and tiles need to be addressed. “People with disabilities should be involved in planning,” she says.Rishi Dhakal, 44, a wheelchair user for the past 21 years and president of the Spinal Cord Injury Network Nepal, says that while the KMC has been building new footpaths and pavements with nice bricks and tiles, they often fail to meet the measurements for wheelchair use.Rishi notes that the footpath in Narayantar, between Bagmati Bridge to Jorpati Chowk, has become easier for pedestrians and the visually impaired due to reduced parking and fewer street vendors. But it remains inaccessible for wheelchair users due to a lack of proper slopes.“On many footpaths, especially at crossroads, the slope is not favourable for wheelchairs to climb,” he explains. “The footpath has become just a showpiece.”Rishi and his organisation are working to arrange a meeting with the minister and secretary of the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport to present a memorandum advocating for wheelchair-friendly slopes on Kathmandu’s footpaths. On July 21, Rishi met with the ministry’s Joint Secretary Sushil Babu Dhakal to discuss the next steps.While Rishi appreciates the ongoing work to widen pavements on New Road, he doubts the standard measurements for slopes and inclined planes for wheelchair users will be adhered to, citing KMC’s recent work on footpaths near Tribhuvan International Airport where the slopes are inaccessible.Another wheelchair user, Muskan Adhikari, pointed to a double problem of inaccessibility: footpaths lack slopes, and the sky bridges are not wheelchair-friendly. Moreover, she has faced incidents where vehicles did not stop at crossings when traffic police were absent, leading to several close calls.Rishi’s organisation has also received reports of incidents of wheelchair users being hit by vehicles in the Jorpati area.“The constitution promises accessible infrastructure for people with disabilities to navigate independently, but the current footpaths and infrastructure makes independent travel very difficult,” Adhikari said. “Forget pavements, even government offices are not accessible.”Rishi says that even the Health Ministry is only accessible up to the first floor, “forcing us to wait all day for meetings as ministers do not sit on the first floor.” This lack of accessibility extends to the KMC office itself, which has a metal ramp that is extremely difficult for wheelchair users to use and there is no tactile paving either.Vishwo Shrestha, director at the Blind Youth Association Nepal, reveals that their organisation frequently receives reports of blind and visually impaired individuals falling into sewers and rivers due to inadequate safety measures. In Sukedhara, where several offices catering to the blind community are located, a lack of proper fences along Dhobikhola river had previously resulted in accidents. The association had petitioned the KMC a year and a half ago for guard rails or road safety barriers.“Despite the installation of guard rails, there have been recent cases of individuals falling into the river due to gaps in the barriers,” Shrestha says. Shrestha adds that while not all incidents are reported, they receive two to three cases every two months involving falls into rivers or sewers. Many incidents involving collisions with poles or trees due to poor tactile guidance or uneven footpaths go unreported. “This reflects a major failure of the state’s duty,” he said.Meanwhile, for 36-year-old Radha Kumal, a blind white cane user, problems in footpaths and pavements are just part of the larger problems in the country’s road infrastructure. “We don’t know where the zebra cross begins, and traffic lights are useless for us as we cannot see the colour change,” she says. Many like Kumal hope for audio signals at traffic lights to ensure safe and independent road crossings.Sukhdev Ray, 41, who is deaf and lives in Baneshwar, points out a different but equally critical issue: lack of proper signage. “Without clear directional signs in public spaces like pavements, it’s hard for us to find our destinations,” Ray says. “As I can’t hear, I rely on signs for guidance.”Ray also adds that many traffic lights either malfunction or are ignored by drivers. “Crossing the road can be chaotic,” he notes. “With drivers in a rush and traffic lights often disregarded, I often fear getting hit, like I was the last time.”Ray was hit by a motorcycle while walking at Satdobato four months ago. Though he didn’t suffer major injuries, he is still reminded of the incident while walking on the road. He was also hit by a Safa tempo twice in Bhaisepati in June.Sugam Bhattarai, general secretary of the National Federation of the Disabled Nepal (NFDN), acknowledges that the KMC’s new footpaths and railings are a step forward but “they are usually limited to major areas like New Road and lack comprehensive accessibility features.”According to Bhattarai, in Nepal, the term ‘disabled-friendly’ often translates to just adding tactile paving and a ramp, ticking off an ‘inclusivity checklist’ without genuinely addressing accessibility needs. “What about individuals with deafness or intellectual disabilities?” he questions. The Act Relating to Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 2017, and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD), which Nepal has ratified, mandate accessibility to infrastructure.Article 9 of the UNCRPD says, “States Parties shall take appropriate measures to ensure to persons with disabilities access to the physical environment, transportation, information and communications, and other facilities and services open or provided to the public, both in urban and in rural areas.”Despite these legal frameworks, implementation remains inconsistent.Kumal shared that the ongoing pavement widening project at New Road has uprooted both sides of the road, leaving no alternative paths or assistance for the blind. “There’s no guidance or facilities for us,” she said.Shrestha criticises the KMC’s approach for lacking provisions for the blind and visually impaired. “Construction continues without first ensuring alternative routes or proper information,” he said.Nabin Manandhar, spokesperson for the KMC, assures that their pavement widening project at New Road includes considerations for disability access. “While we’re committed to making footpaths accessible, we’re not yet at the stage where we can address all types of disabilities,” he said.“We’ve just started. We welcome suggestions and acknowledge that we can’t address every issue alone.”Baburam Bhattarai, an expert member at the City Planning Commission under the KMC, emphasised that new projects adhere to disability guidelines. “We are monitoring compliance and plan to address issues with old pavements, including complaints about obstructing electric poles,” he said.However, officials blame funding constraints as a barrier in implementing good ideas.In 2021, the Department of Roads allocated Rs50 million for disabled-friendly pavements. The first phase (1.5km from Putalisadak to Thapathali) was completed, but the second phase at Durbarmarg and Jamal was halted due to budget constraints, according to Narayan Dutta Bhandari, division chief of the Road Division of Kathmandu.Rishi said that they, along with the NFDN, will start monitoring construction across the capital. If the right parameters are not followed, they will negotiate with the KMC, even if it means halting the work, he said.“We’ve learned to navigate the inconveniences in Kathmandu’s pavements and roads, but that doesn’t mean they’re not problematic,” Kumal says. “Accessible infrastructure is our right. While we do our best to adapt, we expect the government to adapt to our needs as well.” \nGoat rearing has attracted farmers in Rolpa, a hill district in Nepal’s midwest. There are 59 households in Korchabang where most families have started commercial goat rearing.Lush forests, plants and trees and a good source of water make commercial goat rearing feasible in Rolpa, the heartland of the decade-long Maoist war that ended in 2006.In recent years, farmers have started growing different varieties of grasses in the villages too.Jokh Bahadur Gharti Magar, a farmer from Minahi, Korchabang, who is popular in the village for rearing many goats, said he is not worried about wild grass as he himself grows the varieties rich in nutrients on his farmland. He can also source fodder from the nearby forest.Magar, who runs a hotel in Minahi, is supported by his family for commercial goat keeping.“I started with a small investment. Later, my family helped me with more funds to increase the number of goats,” said Magar. The veterinary hospital in the district and the animal husbandry centre have also helped Magar and other farmers in their enterprise.The Smart Krishi Gaun programme run by the government for the past three years recognises Magar is one of the successful entrepreneurs. Magar is among high earners from goat rearing in Korchabang. As grass production is good in the area, farmers find the business highly profitable, said Bhim Prakash Pun, president of a farmers’ group.The government, through the veterinary hospital in Rolpa and the Livestock Service Centre, has implemented animal rearing programmes in the region. The Smart Krishi Gaun Programme Implementation Committee looks after agricultural affairs. Kaman Buda, a local politician, said rearing goats by building modern sheds is becoming more profitable.The farmers are rearing goats in better ways and have an income even in the rainy season. It is improving the economic situation, said Prasash Pun Magar, chairman of the Madi rural municipality ward 6. Among 59 farmers rearing goats, the annual incomes of 15 are good.Bhim Prakash Pun, who was in politics before taking up goat rearing, presides over the farmers’ group. He leads the Korchabang Smart Krishi Gaun Programme Implementation Committee.“Commercial goat rearing has become a major source of our income,” Pun said. The implementation of the Smart Krishi Programme and learning about modern ways of raising goats encouraged villagers to start the business. “So I started spending less time in politics and more in business.”The goat rearing initiative under the Smart Krishi Programme started in 2020. Farmers have been trained to cultivate grasses and manage sheds in modern ways.Pun has 20–25 goats, after selling 15 he-goats and 15 kids at once. The money goes to the education of children and household expenses.Around 15 to 20 households in Korchabang have started goat rearing as a major business.Technicians taught the farmers to build modern sheds. They also learnt grass cultivation and feed preparation, said Dr Shankar Neupane, chief of Veterinary and Animal Service Expert Centre. Training on financial transactions was also imparted.To make the 59 farmers entrepreneurs, the government has spent around Rs10.5 million, Neupane said. Jokh Bahadur Gharti Magar, a local farmer, said that the financial and technical support from the government was a big help for them.“From the hotel business, I came back to agriculture and livestock rearing,” Magar said. “After much thought, I took up goat farming by making a modern shed.”Gharti Magar, a former weightlifter, is happy as a farmer. He has 28 goats in the shed and has requested the provincial and federal governments to introduce additional programmes and provide another technician.Subha Bahadur Budhamagar, who also took to commercial goat rearing after a long teaching career, earns well.The government is doing proper inspection, said Matilal Kunwar, officer at Veterinary Hospital and Livestock Service Expert Center.Tirtha Raj Pun and Kaman Budha are rearing goats in Punthok and Jyang villages, respectively. Pun started with four goats and now has 10.Kaman Budha, who is also a trader, served villagers as a social worker. He rears 10–15 goats and takes them to Dang to sell. \nBarahi Jungle Lodge has been announced as Nepal’s first hotel to receive certification under the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC) Hotel Sustainability Basics programme.This certification recognises hotels that excel in sustainability by implementing essential criteria for responsible operations. Barahi Jungle Lodge’s achievement highlights its excellence in three core areas: energy efficiency, planet-friendly operations, and community support. The lodge has implemented various measures, including reducing energy consumption, eliminating single-use plastics, and actively supporting local communities. This dedication sets a new benchmark for sustainable hospitality in Nepal. In addition to the WTTC certification, Barahi Jungle Lodge has also been awarded the TOFTigers Outstanding Certification, a testament to its commitment to conservation and responsible tourism.The WTTC’s Hotel Sustainability Basics is a global standard designed to guide hotels in their sustainability journey, with 12 fundamental criteria covering environmental, social, and operational practices. \nAfter the devastating earthquakes in 2015, Nepal saw a dramatic shift in dietary habits, stimulated by the inflow of cash for reconstruction. This massive cash inflow also led to an explosion in the availability of packaged snack foods.Now, people are avid consumers of fast food and packaged foods, and the trading and manufacturing of such food businesses are growing exponentially.This inadvertently increased the demand for unhealthy foods as people become accustomed to readily available options, according to the Global Food Policy Report 2024, published by the International Food Policy Research Institute recently.These foods with low nutritional content are packaged and ready to eat at any given point.“The emergency food aid provided after the earthquake included packaged foods like instant noodles,” the report said.Poor diet quality is a significant reason for poor nutrition outcomes. The report, authored by multiple experts, covers Africa, the Middle East and North Africa, Central Asia, South Asia, East and South East Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean.According to the report, 45 percent of Nepal's population consumes salty and fried snacks. The country's vegetable intake has been poor, with 11 percent of the population consuming “zero” vegetables and fruits.The report said progress is slowing on reducing undernutrition and micronutrient deficiencies in low- and middle-income countries while observing a rapid rise in overweight and obesity rates. This double burden of malnutrition—where undernutrition coexists with diet-related noncommunicable diseases—poses significant global health challenges.The report also stresses that food systems significantly contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and environmental degradation, urging their transformation to reduce environmental impacts while ensuring food security. Malnutrition rates remain high, and non-communicable diseases are rising in South Asia.“With the increased consumption of packaged food, particularly by the children, it has sharply increased childhood obesity. Overconsumption of zero nutrition and zero calorie packaged food has increased the malnutrition rate in children, especially school-age ones,” said Dr Sudhashree Adhikari, a nutritionist.“Immature growth in children and disturbance in the menstruation cycle is being seen in women, largely due to the consumption of packaged and processed meat and dairy products. These products often contain growth hormones used in poultry, dairy, and cattle production.”“Producers inject hormonal growth supplements into poultry to speed up production, and these hormones get stored in the animal’s organs,” she said. “When people consume these products, it can lead to hormonal imbalances.”Adhikari said that hormonal imbalance in women and chronic hypertension and diabetes in men have sharply gone up mainly due to the high intake of carbohydrates that are found in packaged and processed food.According to experts, the low and middle-income brackets have been cutting their healthy food intake from their plates with the rising prices of vegetables and dairy products.The report said nearly 80 percent of Nepal's population cannot afford a healthy diet as healthier food options cost more in countries with poorer infrastructure and logistics.It has been several months since the prices of most green vegetables crossed over Rs100 per kg. For instance, even a kg of bottle gourd, a common and seasonal vegetable, costs around Rs120 per kg in retail.As Nepal does not produce enough fruits, most of the fruit requirements are fulfilled through imports. For example, a kg of Chinese Fuji apples costs around Rs400.The report said that only 1.1 percent of Nepali adults (over 15 years old) consume 400 grams of fruits and vegetables daily, which is the WHO's recommendation.Fruits and vegetables are rich sources of vitamins, minerals, fibre, and antioxidants that protect against numerous diseases.According to Nepal Rastra Bank, vegetable inflation increased by 16.02 percent in mid-June compared to last year.For example, lately, dairy companies have struggled to sell milk. They have converted the milk into powder and butter, but even these products remain unsold, leaving tonnes of the products piling up in the warehouses of the state-owned and private dairies.Both state-owned and private dairy companies said the ongoing economic slowdown has dampened dairy demand, resulting in stopped cash flow and rising liabilities to farmers as products remained unsold for several months.Nepal’s growth rate, which measures the country’s output and people's income, has remained dismal, averaging 3.4 percent in the last five years.Import figures show the clear picture of how packaged foods have grown and displaced traditional food habit systems.According to the Department of Customs, Nepal imported 2,420 tonnes of chocolates worth Rs1.66 billion in the last fiscal year ended July 15.The country also imported 4,146 tonnes of sweet biscuits worth Rs997.62 million, 1,657 tonnes of Kurkure and Lays worth Rs911.78 million, 2,818 tonnes of dalmoth and namkeen worth Rs800.95 million, and 1,867 tonnes of packaged bakery items worth Rs612.58 million.The country imported 1,609 tonnes of chewing gum worth Rs582.74 and 1,478 frozen French fries worth Rs226.26 million.Hem Raj Regmi, the deputy chief statistician at the National Statistics Office, said that packaged and processed food consumption is increasing in the country mainly due to rapid urbanisation, a rise in single families, a growing number of working women, and changing food habits.“The remittance is the key. It has fueled the consumption of such products,” said Regmi, who holds a doctoral (PhD) in food security.He said that remittances affect food expenditure in two distinct ways.“When you have money, you increase your calorie intake, but income from remittances may also compound trends toward purchasing less healthy foods associated with the nutrition transition.”Experts said that unchecked sale of packaged and processed food items, especially in rural parts of the country, easy availability of counterfeit food and beverage products with no quality inspection, and the import of packaged food products high in palm oil and sugar are causing severe health issues in the majority of people.The government's lax inspection has also led to an increase in traders selling expired food items by relabeling them.In Nepal, 39 percent of the population consumes all five recommended food groups, including at least one starchy staple, one vegetable, one fruit, one pulse, one nut and seed, and one animal-source food, the study states.The report said poor diets are caused by a mix of factors: insufficient crop diversity; low affordability due to low per capita income and higher prices of nutritious foods; inefficient, underdeveloped markets and value chains; easy access to highly processed foods; and aggressive promotion.According to the poultry association, an egg now costs around Rs25 in retail, up from Rs17 a year earlier and has become out of reach for most low-income people.The report said that in 2050, no countries in sub-Saharan Africa and few countries in Asia and the Pacific could supply the World Health Organization’s minimum recommended daily per capita intake of 400 grams of fruits and vegetables.Adhikari said that vegetables and fruits fulfil the required micronutrients, like vitamins and minerals. Live enzymes, Vitamin B12, and calcium are also found in vegetables and fruits, and such products are less consumed. \nDespite regular supply, the prices of most vegetables in Kathmandu Valley have gone up sharply, forcing the majority of Nepalis to cut the recommended daily vegetable intake.Traders said that farmers have increased the rates of vegetables due to the rise in the cost of production.The comparative price index of the wholesale vegetable market in Kalimati shows that the price of vegetables like tomatoes, potatoes, onions, and other seasonal and non-seasonal vegetables has increased within two weeks.“The supply situation is normal,” said Binay Shrestha, information officer at the Kalimati Fruits and Vegetable Market Development Board, the country’s largest vegetables and fruits marketplace. “Normally, the vegetable price goes up in the rainy season. This year, farmers have increased the prices of their crops, and as a result, prices have increased sharply.”He said that farmers’ crops have been hit by excessive rainfall. The heatwave, too, affected production. “To compensate for their losses, vegetable prices increased at the farm gate.”The Kalimati market received over 700 tonnes of vegetables on Wednesday, which is considered a normal supply.The wholesale price of all three different types of tomatoes has increased. The price of tomato big (Nepali) has increased by 26.67 percent to Rs95 per kg, while the price of tomato small (local) has jumped by 101.52 percent to Rs45 per kg, and the price of tomato small (tunnel) has gone up by 92.13 percent to Rs61 per kg.The potato price has also increased significantly. The price of potato red (Indian) has increased by 3.64 percent to Rs57 per kg, potato red (Mudhe) has gone up by 15.69 percent to Rs59 per kg, and potato white has risen by 4.57 percent to Rs53.33 per kg.The dry onion price increased by 18.63 percent to Rs97.67 per kg. Shrestha said the onion price has been impacted by the rise in the Indian onion price.The wholesale price of cabbage (local) has jumped by 30.05 percent to Rs75 per kg within two weeks. The wholesale price of cauli local (Jyapu) has also risen by 15.79 percent to Rs110 per kg.On Thursday, the Cowpea (long) price increased by 26.67 percent to Rs95 per kg.The price of bottle gourd has increased by 28.57 percent to Rs45 per kg and smooth gourd by 28.57 percent to Rs45 per kg.Despite being seasonal vegetables, the price of pointed gourds has increased. The wholesale price is Rs75 per kg, up 36.36 percent.Similarly, the price of French beans (local) increased by 46.15 percent to Rs95 per kg, while the price of French beans (hybrid) also increased by 46.15 percent to Rs95 per kg within two weeks.The wholesale price of sword beans climbed by 4.55 percent to Rs115 per kg.The prices of squash (round) and okra have also gone up. The squash round price has gone up 30.77 percent to Rs85 per kg, and the okra price has gone up 28.57 percent to Rs45 per kg.According to Nepal Rastra Bank, vegetable inflation increased by 16.02 percent in mid-June compared to the same period last year.A separate report said that Nepalis are consuming fewer vegetables and fruits due to cost factors and their growing habit of consuming packaged foods.According to Global Food Policy Report 2024, published by the International Food Policy Research Institute last month, in Nepal’s capital, Kathmandu, children under two years get a quarter of their calories from unhealthy snack foods and beverages.The report said that only 1.1 percent of Nepalis adults (over 15 years old) consume 400 grams of fruits and vegetables daily, which is the WHO's recommendation. The report showed that Nepal’s consumption of salty and fried snacks is high among South Asian nations, with more than 40 percent of the population eating them.Fruits and vegetables are rich sources of vitamins, minerals, fibre, and antioxidants that protect against numerous diseases.The report said that in 2050, no countries in sub-Saharan Africa and few countries in Asia and the Pacific could supply the World Health Organization’s minimum recommended daily per capita intake of 400 grams of fruits and vegetables.The cost premium—that is, the additional cost for the least-cost nutrient-adequate diet above the least-cost source of calorie adequacy—is larger in South Asia than in any other region.For example, dark green leafy vegetables and vitamin A-rich fruits and vegetables cost 8 to 22 times more per calorie than starchy staples and twice as much per calorie as sugary and salty snacks.A study in a low-income country revealed substantial changes in food behaviours over the past decade, with increased consumption of rice, meat, and highly processed snack foods. \nAmid heavy rainfall in many places across the country, Anbukhaireni Rural Municipality of Tanahun district has been hit by a massive dengue outbreak, with over 900 positive cases in a single ward within a month.Local health facilities are struggling to cope with the overwhelming number of seriously ill patients.“Over 900 people from ward 3 have tested positive for dengue within a month,” Agam Raj Upadhyaya, health coordinator of the rural municipality, told the Post over the phone from Anbukhaireni. “Forty-five patients are currently being treated on just 15 beds at Anbukhaireni Hospital. The hospital floors and corridors are packed with infected people.”Health officials warn that the actual number of dengue cases could be higher, as people having mild symptoms are not getting tested and are resting at home.They also informed that around two dozen seriously ill patients have been sent to Chitwan, Pokhara, and Kathmandu for further treatment.“What worries us most is that with the spike in positive cases, we are also seeing an increase in seriously ill patients,” said Upadhyaya. “These patients need intensive care, which is why we have to refer them to Chitwan, Kathmandu and Pokhara.”Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika, according to the World Health Organisation.So far two died and 3755 tested positive with the dengue virus that has spread in 74 districts across the country.Public health experts say the real number of infections could be several times higher, as the government’s case reporting system is not very effective, and more than 80 percent of the cases are asymptomatic. Data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division shows that only 715 people have tested positive for the virus in Tanahun, far less than what is reported by the rural municipality.“We don’t know how they are counting, but we have reported all the confirmed cases,” said Upadhyaya.Other health officials also told the Post that health authorities are misrepresenting the true extent of dengue infection and deaths.Public health experts warn that dengue cases could escalate in the coming days as heavy rainfall continues across the country and post-monsoons season, which is considered the main dengue season, is yet to start.“The coming days will be more challenging for us, as dengue cases could surge,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at Shukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital at Teku in Kathmandu.Public health experts criticise the authorities for their narrow focus on merely counting cases and deaths, which does little to control the spread of the deadly disease.Experts say the disease will not stop spreading unless the lessons and experiences gained from previous outbreaks are implemented.Meanwhile, the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division on Friday issued new guidelines to control the spread of the dengue virus. The guidelines stress the need for searching and destroying mosquito larvae, but do not recommend insecticide spraying, as past experience shows that this measure is futile in controlling the epidemic.Officials say fogging with insecticides is only a symbolic measure and does not effectively kill larvae, pupae, or eggs, particularly if done during the day. Experts say a massive awareness campaign is instrumental in destroying the breeding ground of the dengue-spreading vector, and the public must be made aware of the treatment.Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms, which do not need any treatment or can be treated with paracetamol at home.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects such as plastic cups and bottles could be breeding grounds for dengue-carrying mosquitoes.According to doctors, mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache and pain in the eyes are some of the symptoms of dengue. Doctors advise that those with these symptoms should seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and access to proper medical care can lower fatalities.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district. Since then, an increasing number of dengue infections, including major outbreaks, have been reported from many districts.At least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts in 2023.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Though the post-monsoon period is considered the dengue epidemic season, the deadly disease has already become endemic in Nepal, as outbreaks are reported every month, including in the winter months. \nThe Epidemiology and Disease Control Division has alerted all agencies concerned about the growing risk of the spread of mpox, also known as the monkeypox virus, in communities.The division’s alert follows Wednesday's declaration of a global public health emergency by the World Health Organisation. The UN agency defines an international public health emergency as an “extraordinary event” that poses a serious public health risk.“We have also asked concerned agencies and officials to step up surveillance measures and send people suspected to have contracted the virus to the National Public Health Laboratory for the test,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director of the division. “We also held a discussion with the representative of the UN health body in Nepal and other officials concerned about the potential risk of the mpox virus spreading.”Monkeypox is a rare disease caused by infection with the monkeypox virus. It is the second time since the UN health body declared mpox a global health emergency in two years, as the virus has spread alarmingly in the African continents and is at risk of entering other continents. The WHO said that 524 people died and more than 14,000 cases of infection have been reported this year alone in Africa, which exceeded last year’s figure.The mpox virus is transmitted through close contact such as sex, skin-to-skin contact, and the respiratory tract or mucous membranes.Doctors say animal-to-human transmission often occurs through bites, scratches or direct contact with infected animals’ blood, body fluids or wounds. The virus causes flu-like symptoms.Nepal had confirmed mpox infection in June last year after a 60-year-old foreigner tested positive for monkeypox infection.Public health experts say that every disease seen in any corner of the world is possible to come to Nepal due to the high mobility of its own people and foreign tourists. They say it is relatively easier for people from any part of the globe to come to Nepal and that it increases the risk of any disease seen in any part of the globe arriving in Nepal.“We cannot keep repeating the same mistake. When Covid spread in China, we thought that since we did not have a direct flight from disease-hit areas, the chance of the disease spreading to Nepal was low, but this proved to be wrong,” said Dr Shrawan Kumar Mishra, director at the provincial Public Health Laboratory of Madhesh Province. “Many people from our country travel to Africa, and our UN peacekeepers also serve there and return home. Anyone coming back from disease-hit countries must be kept in isolation for three weeks.”Experts say screening at the health desks of international airports and land crossings alone is not enough to prevent a possible outbreak of monkeypox in the country since symptoms usually appear between five and 21 days after infection. Moreover, not everyone will have visible symptoms on their skin or limbs. They say that asymptomatic persons can also transmit the virus.Symptoms of the mpox virus include fever, headache, swelling, body pains, exhaustion, and itchy rashes on the face, hands, and feet.As the disease primarily spreads through close person-to-person contact, public health experts recommend self-isolation and good hygiene to avoid it. Doctors say that even though monkeypox infection is usually mild and most people recover within weeks, the authorities concerned should not underestimate the risks.Globally, more than 87,000 cases and 112 deaths from monkeypox were reported in 2022, according to the WHOThe UN health body said it is working with countries and vaccine manufacturers on potential vaccine donations and coordinating with partners through the interim Medical Countermeasures Network to facilitate equitable access to vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics and other tools. \nAmid a surge in new coronavirus cases in the country, the Ministry of Health and Population is preparing to roll out a Covid vaccine across the seven provinces.Officials said that elderly people, those with compromised immunity, and children between five and 11 years will be jabbed with the monovalent coronavirus vaccine supplied by the COVAX facility last month.“Most of the provincial health offices have already placed demands for the vaccine,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “We will start supplying vaccine doses to provinces within a week.”The monovalent or single component vaccine is designed for the Omicron sub-variant XBB.1.5 of SARS-CoV-2.Lately, Nepal has witnessed a rise in coronavirus cases. The World Health Organisation’s report on integrated influenza and other respiratory virus surveillance for week 31 of 2024 shows a SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate of 13.68 percent in Nepal. Also, the latest data from the National Public Health Laboratory indicates a sharp increase in cases. Of the 5,373 tests conducted since January, 341 came out positive for Covid. The test positivity rate is 6.3 percent, which is concerning, according to experts.Doctors say that the number of people suffering from fever, sore throat, body aches, and common cold has risen.The COVAX facility, the United Nations-backed international vaccine-sharing scheme, supplied Nepal with 1.6 million monovalent vaccine doses in the first week of July.Officials said that around 100,000 children with underlying conditions—cancer, HIV, and others will be administered the vaccine.Along with these children, pregnant women, people with compromised immunity, those with chronic diseases, and people over the age of 55 have been designated as vulnerable groups, officials said.Since the end of the second wave of Covid in 2021, health authorities across Nepal have stopped active case finding, including contact tracing and free testing. Hospitals now only conduct tests for those seeking polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for travel abroad or for seriously ill patients with respiratory conditions. Multiple doctors the Post spoke with said that the circulation of coronavirus has never stopped and is unlikely to stop in the near future.Infectious disease experts and virologists urge the public to take precautions to protect the elderly and people with comorbidities from the deadly virus. They warn that even if most people may not show severe symptoms from Covid infection, the elderly and people with underlying conditions remain at high risk.“We saw elderly people requiring intensive care during the previous surge in April,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “It’s time to return to the basics—washing hands, wearing face masks, avoiding crowds—to save at-risk groups like the elderly and those with underlying conditions.”Over 12,000 people died, and hundreds of thousands were infected in the first, second and third waves of the Covid pandemic.Meanwhile, the National Public Health Laboratory said that an Omicron sub-variant of the coronavirus is responsible for the surge in new infections of late. According to the latest update issued by the laboratory, the Omicron variant has been found in all 42 swab samples in the whole genome sequencing.Whole-genome sequencing is a comprehensive method of analysing the entire DNA sequence of an organism’s genes. Researchers believe this approach could be instrumental in tracking the virus’s severity and properties.This time, however, the laboratory has not provided information about the specific Omicron sub-variant. \nAs the spread of cholera continues unabated, agencies under the Ministry of Health and Population have started discussions to explore the possibility of vaccinating the people in affected areas against the deadly disease.Officials said that health authorities concerned and aid agencies held several rounds of discussions about containing the ongoing spread of the highly contagious disease.“We have also held discussion with the officials of the World Health Organisation in Nepal about the possibility of inoculating the people in the cholera hit areas including Lalitpur,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “We have also planned to discuss the issue with experts from the National Immunisation Advisory Committee.”Cholera is a highly infectious disease that causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting, leading to dehydration and even death within a few hours if untreated. The World Health Organisation says cholera is a global threat to public health and an indicator of inequality and a lack of social development.At least 50 people from four districts—38 in Lalitpur, eight in Kailali, and two each in Kathmandu and Pyuthan districts—have contracted cholera so far this year. Health officials said that the Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool samples of the infected patients.Public health experts said that detected cases of cholera infection could be just a tip of the iceberg, as most of the positive cases are being reported from the districts having active surveillance, including the three districts of the Kathmandu Valley and Kailali.Last year, health authorities administered an oral cholera vaccine in Kathmandu Metropolitan City’s wards 11, 12, and 13, which were highly affected by the outbreak. Vaccines against the deadly disease were administered in Kapilvastu and Rautahat districts in the past after all efforts to contain the spread of the disease failed.Health officials concede that even if they have discussed the issue of inoculating people from the disease hit areas with anti cholera vaccine, it is easier said than done. They said that finding an anti-cholera vaccine is challenging, as production of the vaccine itself is very low. Moreover, the government has not allocated a budget for the programme.“We have also talked with representatives of the Global Alliance for Vaccine and Immunisation (GAVI), which provides vaccines free of cost to Nepal,” Ghimire said. “But they told us that the chance of supplying vaccines in the near future is low. We have to prepare for cholera vaccination for next year.”Cholera outbreaks during the monsoon season are not a new thing in Nepal, as hundreds of people throughout the country suffer from diarrhoeal infections that continue for months every year and scores contract the disease.In 2022, a total of 77 cholera cases were confirmed in the Valley.Public health experts say that due to poor sanitation and hygiene conditions, the country as a whole is highly vulnerable to water-borne illnesses including diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid, hepatitis, and cholera, with thousands of people getting infected every year.They say sheer negligence from authorities concerned is responsible for ongoing outbreak of diarrhoeal diseases including the deadly cholera.Health authorities in most local units had stopped the testing of drinking water just before the start of the monsoon season, citing lack of funds, although deadly microbes such as faecal coliform and E coli were frequently detected in drinking water samples.Most of the water sources contaminated with deadly microbesOfficials at the Health Office, Lalitpur said that contamination of most of the sources of water—tap water, ground water, tanker water—is a main challenge to contain the spread of the cholera.“We have yet to check the quality of the jar water, which is widely used in offices, hotels and homes for drinking,” said Dr Bhuwan Paudel, chief of Health Office, Lalitpur. “But faecal coliform has been found in most of the samples of tap water, ground water and tanker water being used in Lalitpur.”Faecal coliform, a microscopic organism, is found in human faeces. According to doctors, the presence of faecal coliform in drinking water means it is contaminated with sewage.Doctors say bottled water, which is widely used by households and offices in Kathmandu Valley, is generally considered safe, but water quality of several companies have been found questionable. Dangerous microbes are detected in bottled water every year, which means not all jar water brands are safe to drink without treatment.They say consumption of contaminated water not only can cause diarrhoeal infections and deadly cholera but also increases the risk of contracting dysentery, typhoid, and hepatitis A and E.They stress that awareness drives and ensuring safe drinking water are crucial to protect people from water-borne diseases.A combination of careful surveys, provision of safe drinking water, good sanitation and hygiene standards, social mobilisation and treatment is required to contain the spread of infection, according to doctors.Doctors have asked authorities to launch awareness drives against water-borne diseases and ensure safe drinking water to prevent deaths from illnesses like cholera.To contain the spread of the infection, a combination of careful surveys, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation, and treatment is required, according to experts.The World Health Organisation has also said that a multifaceted approach is key to controlling cholera and reducing deaths. \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar. \nThe noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built. Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nSecond-half goals from Diogo Jota and Mohamed Salah allowed new Liverpool coach Arne Slot to get off to a 2-0 winning start at newly promoted Ipswich Town in the Premier League on Saturday.Ipswich, cheered on by new minority shareholder and singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran from the Portman Road stands, went toe-to-toe with Liverpool in the first half but failed to take their chances when they presented themselves.Slot’s new side improved markedly after the break, taking the lead on the hour mark through Jota before a fine move was finished off by Egyptian forward Salah five minutes later to effectively kill off the Ipswich challenge.Liverpool had a host of chances to make the result even more emphatic, but two goals were enough to navigate Liverpool and Slot past a tricky first game of the campaign.“Hopefully I keep going like this for the whole season,” Salah told TNT Sports. Coach Slot’s side clicked into gear after the break, however, carving open their opponents with two fine goals, the first finished off by Jota after a pinpoint Trent Alexander-Arnold pass set Salah free before he squared for the Portuguese.With Ipswich still regrouping, Salah, in his 350th appearance for the club in all competitions, netted superbly after being played in by Dominik Szoboszlai to seal the victory.Havertz and Saka fire Arsenal to opening win over WolvesArsenal eased to a 2-0 home win over Wolverhampton Wanderers as goals by Kai Havertz and Bukayo Saka got their Premier League title challenge up and running on Saturday.It was far from a fluent display in the summer sunshine but Mikel Arteta’s side, once again regarded as the team most likely to halt Manchester City’s domination, deserved the points.Havertz headed in from Saka’s cross in the 25th minute but the hosts never looked completely comfortable until Saka’s clinical finish doubled their advantage in the closing stages.Wolves had their chances with Rayan Ait-Nouri and Rodrigo Gomes both failing to trouble Arsenal keeper David Raya from promising positions when the score was 1-0.“I am really happy. With the first game you have some uncertainty in how you will respond,” Arteta said.Arsenal, runners-up to City for the past two seasons, dominated the opening period and took the lead when Saka was given too much time to pick out Havertz who directed his header into the corner to give keeper Jose Sa no chance.Carelessness set in for Arsenal, however, and Wolves came closest to an equaliser when Hwang Hee-chan's cross was met by Larsen with a header that Raya did well to keep out.Arsenal laboured after the break but the points were secured when Saka, Arsenal’s top league scorer last season and most dangerous player on Saturday, cut in from the right and buried a left-foot shot.“Saka is unbelievable. There are not a lot of players like him on the planet and he is still so young,” Havertz said. Dominant Brighton win 3-0 at 10-man EvertonDanny Welbeck scored one goal and set up another as Brighton & Hove Albion eased to a 3-0 victory at 10-man Everton on Saturday, in a perfect start for the Premier League’s youngest-ever permanent manager.Kaoru Mitoma scored at the back post after excellent work from debutant winger Yankuba Minteh, before Welbeck added a second and Simon Adingra a third to underline Brighton’s superiority.Right back Ashley Young was sent off midway through the second half as Everton’s final season at Goodison Park before they end their 132-year stay and move to a new stadium on the banks of the river Mersey got off to the worst possible start.“I thought it was a great performance, from the new manager, the fans and then onto the pitch,” Welbeck said.The visitors took the lead against the run of play when Minteh’s low cross was finished by Mitoma.The home side were awarded a penalty by referee Simon Hooper minutes into the second period when Lewis Dunk slid in on Dominic Calvert-Lewin in the box.But the decision was overturned after an intervention by Video Assistant Referee Darren England, who felt Calvert-Lewin had stood on the foot of the defender.Brighton doubled their advantage shortly afterwards as Idrissa Gueye gave the ball away in midfield and Welbeck was released to score from the edge of the box.The home side were reduced to 10 men midway through the second half when Mitoma got in behind 39-year-old Young, who held onto him, leaving Hooper with no option but to show the red card.Adingra took advantage of the extra space to score a third, while Yasin Ayari had the ball in the back of the net on his Brighton debut but was judged to be marginally offside.Joelinton secures victory for 10-man Newcastle over SouthamptonJoelinton’s goal earned Newcastle a 1-0 win over promoted Southampton in their first game of the Premier League season at St James’ Park on Saturday, despite going down to 10 men in the first half.Fabian Schar was sent off in the 28th minute for retaliating after a foul by Ben Brereton Diaz but the visitors failed to make the most of their numerical advantage, and Newcastle took the lead just before the break.Southampton keeper Alex McCarthy’s poor attempted pass to Jack Stephens was pounced on by Alexander Isak who played the ball across the box and Brazilian Joelinton took one touch before drilling his shot low into the corner of the net.“Southampton are a very good team. They made it difficult for us but I think we did well in the end,” Joelinton said.Southampton had the better of the second half as they piled on pressure in search of an equaliser, but Newcastle held on to take all three points.After Newcastle dominated the early stages, the visitors grew in confidence and had the ball in the net in the 10th minute but Jack Stephens was offside when he tapped in from close range.Southampton were boosted by Schar’s moment of madness after Brereton Diaz bundled him over from behind. The Swiss defender put his head against that of his opponent who went down rather theatrically and the referee pulled out the red card.It was Newcastle, however, who went in at the break a goal up after they took full advantage of McCarthy’s mistake when trying to play it out from the back.Five minutes after the interval Southampton’s Adam Armstrong had a close-range effort cleared off the line by Newcastle defender Lewis Hall, and the home side's keeper Nick Pope needed to be at his best to tip over another Armstrong shot. Semenyo salvages late draw for Bournemouth at ForestBournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo rescued a point for his side with a late equaliser as they drew 1-1 at Nottingham Forest in the Premier League on Saturday.Forest took the lead in the 23rd minute when defensive midfielder Ryan Yates’ close-range shot was parried by goalkeeper Neto and Chris Wood reacted quickly to slot the ball home.The hosts looked comfortable but Bournemouth equalised in the 86th minute when Semenyo smashed the ball in from close range.“I’m disappointed with how we conceded, we had the game under control. It was a tough game, a good game, both teams had momentum. We could have had more,” Forest manager Nuno Espirito Santo told the BBC.Dango Ouattara thought he had equalised for Bournemouth from a corner in the first half, but the goal was disallowed after the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) confirmed Lewis Cook was offside in the build-up.Forest had created a host of chances to double their lead but lacked quality in the final third. Morgan Gibbs-White looked lively and nearly put Forest ahead with a right-footed shot.Forest’s Brazilian midfielder Danilo was carried off on a stretcher 10 minutes into the game with what appeared to be a serious injury following a collision with Semenyo.Onana, Duran earn Villa 2-1 win at West HamAmadou Onana scored four minutes into his Aston Villa debut and Jhon Duran netted a late winner as Unai Emery’s men kicked off their Premier League season with a 2-1 victory at West Ham United on Saturday.The 22-year-old Onana, signed from Everton, leapt high to head home Youri Tielemans’ corner in the fourth minute, easily darting away from Michail Antonio to beat keeper Alphonse Areola from three yards out.“To come here and win is massive for us,” Tielemans said. “It gets us off to a good start. We can enjoy this win because it was a tough battle today.”Villa squandered several excellent chances before Lucas Paqueta drew the hosts level from the penalty spot in the 37th minute, the spot-kick awarded after a VAR check showed Matty Cash had fouled Tomas Soucek.Duran spoiled the home side’s evening, however, after Villa worked the ball down the left side and Jacob Ramsey's cross found Duran for a left-footed shot from the centre of the area through Areola's legs 11 minutes from time.Onana matched Kevin Phillips (2005) to become the joint earliest goalscorer for Villa on their league debut.Villa had a couple of excellent chances to double their lead earlier, first when Leon Bailey had Areola beaten before hitting the post from a tight angle and John McGinn’s shot rolled just wide.But Paqueta equalised soon after from the spot, the Brazilian beating keeper Emi Martinez with a stop-start run-up before calmly side-footing the ball into the bottom left corner.After Duran’s late goal, West Ham were close to equalising again seconds before the final whistle, but Soucek’s header was cleared off the line by Ezri Konsa. \nNepal will aim to win the trophy of the SAFF U-20 Championship for a third time when they begin their campaign of the biennial competition against Sri Lanka on Sunday.Nepal are drawn alongside Sri Lanka and Bangladesh in Group A. Group B consists of three-time champions and holders India, the Maldives and Bhutan.The group stage matches will be held at the ANFA Complex in Satdobato due to poor condition of Dasharath Stadium’s pitch. All Nepal Football Association had decided to move the group matches to Satdobato citing “unprepared pitch at the Dasharath Stadium”. The decision came after SAFF match commissioner Abdul Hameed Abdul Ghafoor, after an inspection, deemed the Dasharath Stadium unfit to host matches.The poor management of pitch of the country’s only international-standard football stadium drew public criticism on Tuesday when Japanese football icon Keisuke Honda’s Paro FC and Martyrs Memorial A-Division League champions Church Boys United played their AFC Challenge League qualification playoff match in a muddy and puddled pitch, following an afternoon rainfall.ANFA has said that the semi-finals and final will be held back at the Dasharath Stadium’s ground, which is undergoing renovation.Nepal coach Urjan Shrestha said he aims to keep the trophy at home.“We have prepared well. We played practice matches against A-Division League champions Church Boys United and Tribhuvan Army Club. We will take full advantage of the home ground and try to win the trophy,” said Shrestha.However, Nepal will face a tough challenge from their closest rivals India, who have dominated the competition for the last five years, winning the trophy for the third consecutive time [2019 (SAFF U-18), 2022 (SAFF U-20), 2023 (SAFF U-19)].Nepal won the first edition defeating India in the final in 2015 (SAFF U-19) at home and defended the title in 2017 (SAFF U-18) in Bhutan.Only Nepal and India have won the SAFF Championship since its inception.India coach Ranjan Chaudhary said they are also aiming to defend the title for a third straight edition.“We are the defending champions and will play the game likewise. But we are focused on our first match,” said Chaudhary, who will open their defense of the title against Bhutan on Monday.Three-time runners up Bangladesh will also aim to dislodge India’s stranglehold and win their first trophy. \nNepal has been selected as the host of the 2025 ICC U-19 Men’s Cricket World Cup Asia Qualifier, set to take place from April 12 to April 21, 2025.The Asia Qualifier is one of the five regional qualifier tournaments to determine the final five teams for the 2026 U-19 Men’s Cricket World Cup, with Africa Qualifier, European Qualifier, East-Asia Pacific Qualifier and Americas Qualifier being the other four competitions.One team from each (five) region will qualify for the main event.“Nepal has been selected as the host nation for the ICC U19 Men’s Cricket World Cup Asia Qualifier 2025,” the Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) said in a press release on Saturday. The Asia Qualifier will feature Nepal (hosts), Afghanistan, Hong Kong, Oman and the United Arab Emirates. The teams will vie for one spot in the 2026 U-19 Men’s Cricket World Cup. “This event marks a significant milestone for cricket in Nepal, and the nation looks forward to welcoming these teams and showcasing its passion for the sport on an international stage,” the cricket governing body added.With home support, Nepal will look to qualify for the World Cup for a consecutive time after featuring in the 2024 ICC U-19 Men’s Cricket World Cup in South Africa. Nepal had topped the six-team table remaining unbeaten to secure their ticket to the 2024 World Cup—their first World Cup in eight years.In South Africa, Nepal had pulled off a thrilling one-wicket victory over Test member Afghanistan in the group stage to progress to the Super Six. The 2026 World Cup will be co-hosted by Zimbabwe and Namibia. \nA late goal by new signing Joshua Zirkzee earned Manchester United a nervy 1-0 victory over Fulham in their Premier League season opener at Old Trafford on Friday.Home supporters were in buoyant mood ahead of the first game of the English top-flight campaign, with four players unveiled on the pitch and new faces in the United boardroom also in attendance.Just as they did at home for much of last season, however, United struggled to break down their opponents in the first half, with captain Bruno Fernandes going closest to scoring the opener.Frustrations grew after the break, only for Dutch substitute Zirkzee to arrive right on cue three minutes from time to earn United victory.“To win here in my first home game and to grab a goal, it couldn’t be better,” Zirkzee told Sky Sports.“Manchester United is a huge club. You should always strive for the best. It's all good vibes.”A smart save from goalkeeper Andre Onana kept an early curling Kenny Tete effort out while Fernandes was presented with two golden opportunities but was denied by Fulham keeper Bernd Leno.Midfielder Mason Mount handed a starting spot after an injury-ravaged first season in Manchester, went close early in the second half.More wayward passing led to groans from supporters, however, before despair turned to jubilation at the death when substitutes Alejandro Garnacho and Zirkzee combined to create the winner.United have more wins and more points from their opening games of Premier League campaigns than any other team, but this performance suggested there is still much to be done for manager Erik ten Hag.Without a Premier League title since 2013 and having addressed key problem areas in the transfer market, United supporters are expecting better than their eighth-placed finish last term. \nAt least 17 Palestinians were killed and dozens wounded in an Israeli strike in the central Gaza town of Zawayda on Saturday, health officials said, as Israel issued new evacuation orders, citing Hamas rocket fire nearby.Israel also announced the names of two soldiers Israeli media reported were killed on Saturday afternoon when a roadside bomb exploded in the central Gaza Strip, and an air strike in the occupied West Bank that it said killed two senior Hamas militants involved in the killing of an Israeli.The violence occurred before US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was expected to land in Israel on Sunday and meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday, amid stepped-up diplomatic efforts to conclude a deal to end the fighting between Israel and the militant Islamist group and free Israeli hostages.Most of the people killed in Zawayda were from the same family and they included eight children and four women, according to health officials in the Hamas-administered enclave.“They were asleep in their beds, kids and babies, then three missiles targeted their place,” said Abu Ahmed Hassan, a neighbour. The owner of the house was a known merchant, he said. “There are no military activities here at all,” he added.The Israeli military said in response it had struck militant targets in an area from which rockets were fired at its troops. It said the incident was under review.Israel’s military spokesperson posted instructions in Arabic on X on Saturday for people in parts of central Gaza, including in the Maghazi district near Zawayda, to evacuate to a designated humanitarian zone.Reuters could not immediately verify whether Zawayda was among the places ordered to evacuate and whether people there had received the military’s instructions. Residents said thousands were streaming out of Maghazi.On Friday, two sections of the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis within what Israel has designated as a humanitarian zone were deemed dangerous by the military, which ordered people to evacuate them, saying militants had been regularly firing rockets from there.The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said Friday’s orders, which also included other areas of the enclave outside the humanitarian zones, had affected around 170,000 displaced people.“This is one of the largest evacuation orders affecting the zone to date and it shrinks the size of the so-called ‘humanitarian area’ to about 41 square kilometres, or 11 per cent of the total area of the Gaza Strip,” an OCHA report said.In the central part of the enclave, residents said Israeli tanks advanced further on Saturday into the eastern area of Deir al-Balah, an area they had not entered before, where hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians are sheltering.The Israeli military said that since Friday its forces had killed dozens of militants, including some who had fired rockets from central and southern Gaza.Most of Gaza’s 2.3 million population has been displaced by the 10-month-old Israeli offensive, which has laid waste to much of the enclave.Another Israeli airstrike on a car in the occupied West Bank city of Jenin on Saturday killed at least two more Palestinians, one an 18-year-old, the Palestinian health ministry said.CEASEFIRE TALKSGaza ceasefire talks in Doha, mediated by the US, Qatar and Egypt, were due to resume next week.A statement from Netanyahu’s office said Israel’s negotiating team had expressed “cautious optimism” on the possibility of advancing a deal “in accordance with the updated American proposal (based on the May 27th framework), including components acceptable to Israel.”US President Joe Biden said on Friday, following two days of talks in Doha, that efforts to reach a deal were now in sight, although he warned that negotiations were “far from over”.Hamas spokesman Jihad Taha told Al Jazeera TV on Saturday that Israel had added conditions in the ceasefire talks and accused Netanyahu of using these to hinder the efforts.Asked about Blinken’s visit to the region, he said the group did not rely on the US as it has been biased towards Israel.Another Hamas official, Osama Hamdan, told Al Jazeera that Israel wanted the right to return to the fight even if a prisoner exchange was agreed. “They want to have the right to attack Gaza whenever they want,” he said.The war was triggered on Oct. 7 when Hamas attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.Israel’s subsequent military campaign has killed more than 40,000 Palestinians, most of them civilians, according to Gaza health authorities. Israel has lost more than 330 soldiers in Gaza since its ground operations there began after Oct. 7, and says at least a third of the Palestinian dead are fighters. \nIndian medical professionals started a 24-hour shutdown of non-emergency services across the country on Saturday in protest against the brutal rape and murder of a doctor in the eastern city of Kolkata.The shutdown, which began at 6 am, will cut off access to elective medical procedures and out-patient consultations in the world’s most populous nation, according to a statement by the Indian Medical Association.Casualty departments at hospitals, which deal with emergencies, will continue to be staffed.A 31-year-old trainee doctor was raped and murdered last week inside a medical college in Kolkata where she worked, triggering nationwide protests among doctors and drawing parallels to the notorious gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old student on a moving bus in New Delhi in 2012.Anger at the failure of tough laws to deter a rising tide of violence against women has fuelled protests by doctors and women’s groups.“Women form the majority of our profession in this country. Time and again, we have asked for safety for them,” IMA President R. V. Asokan told Reuters on Friday.More than a million medics were expected to join the strike. \nDucking as mortar fire exploded around them, Rohingya refugee Mustafa Kamal and his family narrowly escaped the attack by a rebel militia on their town in western Myanmar.Crowds had gathered on a small island to seek shelter after witnessing killings in the coastal town of Maungdaw, he said, but “many died on the spot”, including one of his nephews, Noor Sadek.Others crawled and swam to reach neighbouring Bangladesh, he said.His family are among many Rohingya, members of a persecuted mostly Muslim minority, who fled Myanmar’s Rakhine state in recent days, as fighting escalates between the troops of the ruling junta and the Arakan Army, the powerful ethnic militia that recruits from the Buddhist majority.Reuters was not able to determine how many Rohingya had crossed into Bangladesh, where close to a million Rohingya live in refugee camps outside the coastal town of Cox’s Bazar.But medical charity Medicines Sans Frontières said its doctors had treated 54 people for violence-related injuries in recent days, 40 per cent of them women and children.“We were seeing lots of gunshots, shrapnel, mortar shell injuries, all indicative of indiscriminate,” Orla Murphy, the group’s Bangladesh representative, told Reuters. “They were life-threatening trauma wounds that we were treating.”The influx of refugees, who will have to stay with relatives, stretching resources, will make food supplies scarce, said the representative of a panel of displaced Rohingya.“They are suffering from an extreme food crisis,” added Kamal Hossain, chairman of the panel. “The government and camp authorities should arrange their food.”Many dozens of Rohingya, including a heavily pregnant woman and her two-year-old daughter, were killed last week in drone attacks in Maungdaw that three witnesses said were carried out by the Arakan Army, Reuters reported.The rebel group and the junta blamed one another for the attack. Several boats carrying refugees to Bangladesh were sunk, killing more, Bangladesh media said.The latest wave of attacks, including the burning of a Rohingya town by the Arakan Army in May, is the biggest surge in violence against the Rohingya since a 2017 Myanmar military-led campaign that the United Nations said was carried out with genocidal intent forced more than 730,000 to flee to Bangladesh.‘FIGHTING FOR LIFE’Mohammed Mizanur Rahman, a Bangladesh refugee relief official based in Cox’s Bazar, said Rohingya had been seeking safety in increased numbers since the drone attack but did not say how many had crossed the border.“I have heard that many dead bodies are floating across to Bangladesh and a humanitarian crisis has occurred across the shore in Maungdaw,” he said.Bangladesh is in no position to accept more Rohingya refugees from Myanmar, the South Asian nation’s de-facto foreign minister, Mohammad Touhid Hossain, told Reuters on Thursday, asking neighbouring India and other countries to do more.Hossain also called for more international pressure on the Arakan Army to stop the attacks on the Rohingya in Rakhine state.“But when someone arrives with a bullet injury, fighting for life, or a pregnant woman arrives fighting for life, we are not that inhuman that we will turn them away,” Bangladesh’s Rahman said.The United Nations refugee agency, the UNHCR, said it did not have information on the number of Rohingya who had crossed into Bangladesh.Another man who fled his home with his young family, Mohammed Saber, said about 60 people were killed in his village when the Arakan Army raided it, among them his two-year-old nephew, Mujibul Hasan.They paid traffickers to take them by boat to Bangladesh but the ship came under attack, which killed dozens aboard, he said.The family is now sheltering with an uncle, but Saber has no money. He needs to buy medicine for his children.“I will do whatever it takes to keep my family alive,” he said. \nWhat animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. \nNepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) \nAnother August 14 has passed by with familiar proclamations about the evil designs of the proverbial ‘foreign hand’. As usual, outside conspirators are complemented by enemies inside our own borders. The list is long and comprised of absurdly opposed actors like retired spy chiefs and a women-led Baloch peace movement. Blanket categories like ‘digital terrorism’ are devised.The now months-old ban on social media sites like X has been extended with the operationalisation of a long-touted digital security system (also known as a firewall). Leaving aside for a while the absurd notion that all of this makes us safer, let us focus on the economic fallout that has been triggered.Pakistan is reportedly the fourth biggest gig economy in the world, with millions of (mostly young) people generating incomes through a host of digital platforms. There can be no romanticising the realities of pla­t­form capitalism; it is exploitative, has my­r­iad gendered effects and is cause and consequence of the unprecedented com­m­o­­d­i­f­i­c­a­tion of social life. Yet beggars can’t be choosers in a country where land grabbing, khaki real estate schemes, hoarding, contraband trade, useless mega infrast­ructure projects and the like represent the dominant model of ‘economic development’.Unlike most variants of Pakistani capitalism, the gig economy’s one saving grace is that it generates some employment opportunities for young, educated segments of the population, thus offsetting some of the demographic pressure that is culminating, with almost two million people joining the labour force annually.We have been here before. Temporary bans on YouTube, TikTok and other big social media sites have suffocated the livelihoods of those who have had more or less success monetising their content. Increasingly regular moves to suspend mobile data have badly affected precarious workers reliant on food delivery, ride-sharing and many other apps.The current internet clampdown is affe­c­ting all this as well as call centres, software developers, digital marketing and many other sub-sectors. Even basic commu­nications apps like WhatsApp have been crippled. A number of foreign companies—most prominently Fiverr—have suggested they will soon shift their operations away from Pakistan because their daily losses run into the millions. I care less abo­ut the profits of multinationals than I do about the call centre workers who are being deprived of even their meagre daily wages.The latest hybrid regime started off exhorting the need for foreign investment, and has now succeeded in thwarting its own stated imperative. In 2022, digital freelancers brought in $500 million, which is at least as much concrete currency than we’ve actually see come into the country through the much-touted SIFC.Our khaki-dominated ruling class is so consumed by palace intrigues and the windfall profits of big office that it is unable to see where it is taking what is already a sinking ship. When X and WhatsApp are dee­med threats to ‘national security’ because urban middle class types from military and civilian backgrounds—previously the biggest defenders of the established order—are now using these platforms to criticise the inc­umbent regime, it is obvious that the est­ablishment and its lackeys have lost the plot.It is unsurprising that the powers are petrified by youth-led movements in the peripheries, including the women-led Baloch Yekjheti Committee. Such movements are anti-establishment, and represent a threat to all warring ruling class factions. But here too even a slightly competent ruling class with an eye for the future would realise the clamping down on social media to suppress the group’s reach is a double-edged sword because digital freelancing helps incorporate at least some young disaffected Baloch (as well as Pakhtun, Sindhi, Gilgit-Baltistani, Kashmiri, Seraiki) youth into the system.But there is little competence here, only gimmicks like ‘Digital Pakistan’. Meanwhile young working people in the once-loyal Punjabi heartland are seeing their fragile middle class aspirations go up in smoke, which is, in turn, generating even more disaffection as evidenced not only through political opinions in digital spaces but also in the realms of art and culture. All of this can certainly be suppressed, but the economic pressure cooker cannot bubble over indefinitely.Let me be clear: the decision to suffocate the digital economy mostly affects white-collar youth. The vast majority of our blue-collar working population has no outlet whatsoever, other than menial jobs and emigration by any means necessary. But they could care less, so we should expect more of the same to come. Without a meaningful, countrywide alternative to the game of the thrones, we will all be reduced to freelancers for ruin.-Dawn (Pakistan)/ANN \nOne of the first group experiments of Nepal Studies in the mid-20th century came in the form of a research collective which was later named Samsodhan Mandal. It was founded and led by the late Naya Raj Pant (1913-2002). Pant had studied Siddhant Jyautisa (astronomy) with Padmakar Dvivedi and others in Banaras for about six years during the 1930s. A key text that had greatly influenced him during this period was Bhaskara’s Siddhantasiromani, a 12th-century text. Dvivedi was interested in ancient history and tried to inculcate that interest in his pupils as well. According to Pant, he used to meet with his guru outside of school hours to learn history and other things. From the mid-1930s, Pant started studying the history of Nepal. After returning to Kathmandu in 1938, he came into contact with Baburam Acharya (1888-1972) who gave him old documents to study. Later he came into contact with Sardar Rudra Raj Pandey (1901-1987) who facilitated a six-month research stint for him in the Guthi Office.Pant writes, “From all these [interests and connections], I learnt a bit about Nepali history. When I found mutually contradictory statements [stories] in the history written by foreigners, I began to lose my respect for them. I [then] decided to progressively revise the history of Nepal.” In 1941, Pant was hired by the Ranipokhari Sanskrit Pathashala to teach Jyautisa. From around the same time, he is said to have immersed himself in the further study of Sanskrit grammar and Kautilya’s Arthasastra. Starting from the early 1940s, Pant started a private Pathashala in Kathmandu to train students in Sanskrit, Jyautisa and history. What was his vision then? In Hamro Uddesya ra Karyapranali, a text said to have been written around 1957 but published only in 2002, Pant wrote, “A century has passed since we started taking English-style education. We know first-hand that we have been (mostly) unable to learn work-effective knowledge, or when we have managed to do so, it has not succeeded in our country and produced good results. Now is not the time to remain idle. There is no other way but to rejuvenate our own ancient knowledge. Even though it might require great perseverance and a lot of time, we have to do research on our knowledge and advance it further; we have to maintain our own traditional experiences, and find our own path/method. Only if we manage to do this will we be independently able to make our country more prosperous....It is with this belief that we are engaged in studying-teaching Sanskrit education to rejuvenate our knowledge. The Sanskrit Pathashala has been opened for this purpose.”Just as one founder of the Nepal Sanskritik Parisad (estd 1951) had highlighted the need to cultivate self-identity to shed the cultural dependency on Europe, Pant stressed the need to rejuvenate traditional Sanskrit education as the highway for Nepal’s prosperity. Regarding the particular modality of his Pathashala, in an article published in 2014, historian Yogesh Raj has suggested that Pant had been “impressed by the strict Gurukul-style teachings of an obscure Pandit Genalal Chaudhary” whom he had encountered in Banaras.Pant’s Pathashala adhered to some fundamentals as integral to the process of training as a historian. These included mastery of Sanskrit, palaeography and epigraphy, rote memorisation of some key texts, and rectification of factual errors committed by other historians based on source criticism. When enrolling at the Pathashala, the students had to pledge that they would not use it as a ladder to subsequent education in foreign languages. The guardians of the students also had to sign another piece of paper saying, “From the bottom of my heart, I believe that great knowledge can be attained and livelihood earned even when one does not study English or other foreign languages.”In Pant’s Pathashala, mastery over Sanskrit was given great priority. In the words of his son and disciple Mahes Raj Pant, this enabled the students “to have independent access to many a discipline from the whole range of Sanskrit literature.” Rote learning as part of the ‘traditional method’ was a fundamental tenet of the senior Pant’s training while he was a student, and he replicated this method in his own Pathashala. Recitation of specific texts from memory was how gradual competence was demonstrated in this school. Being able to critically edit old documents and texts of inscriptions and write commentaries on them was another part of the training. The projected time-period to master the skills emphasised in this school was a total of eight years.Following the guru’s command, the students in Pant’s Pathashala mostly invested their academic energies into doing research on the history of Nepal. This work began to thrive after the Rana regime ended in 1951. Its members started to publish pamphlets of Itihas-samsodhan (Amendments of History) from 1952. In the words of Mahes Raj Pant, “In those pamphlets the students pointed out with documentary evidence the errors committed by the so-called scholars in dealing with the history of Nepal. That work of the group attracted a lot of popular attention at the time. Some of the Ithihasa-Samsodhana pamphlets contained harsh words to shock those who were incompetent to write the history of Nepal….The task of the group helped to highlight various aspects of Nepalese history and gave a fresh impetus to the reconstruction of a correct and complete history of Nepal.” In these pamphlets, Mandal students deployed what Raj has called “multi-layer source criticism.” Their “rule of evidence” was “primarily about sustained engagement with the fidelity of evidence and often solely that.” At its largest, the Mandal’s Pathashala had 32 students out of which 21 were involved in the history samsodhan work. However, by the time the Samsodhan Mandal got officially registered in the early 1960s, only ten, including the guru, remained. One member of the group, Gyanmani Nepal (1933-2024), had already graduated by then and returned to his home in eastern Nepal to start a similar Pathashala. Several others had quit the group for various reasons.By the end of the 1960s, the Mandal’s scholars had generated a corpus of booklets including several dozen ‘Amendments of History’. A consolidated and revised collection of 50 such ‘Amendments’ was published in 1962. They had also published a series of Shavadhan-patras, challenging the published work of various scholars and cautioning them against unethical academic practices such as not acknowledging the published work of the Mandal scholars. They had also published several volumes of primary documents, including 12 issues of the quarterly Abhilekh-sangraha, some critically edited historical texts, and over 20 issues of its quarterly journal Purnima (estd 1964). By 1970, the Pathashala had trained individuals such as Dhanavajra Vajracharya (1932-1994), Gyanmani Nepal, the late Shankar Man Rajbanshi, Gautamvajra Vajracharya, Mahes Raj Pant, and several others as historians. Several members of this Pathashala went on to make significant contributions in history-writing of Nepal. They provided us with a relatively secure knowledge of the chronology of the successive ruling dynasties of Nepal from the Licchavi period to the Shah dynasty, made public various types of new historical documents and other sources and set exacting standards for evidence-based history-writing. The main bulk of their contributions fell under the domain of political history, but some of them also made significant contributions to a broader social history. Articles in the essay form and length were the preferred outputs of the members of this school, and interpretive historical narrative of the monograph length was not their strongest mode of written output. Writing in 1984, one of Mandal’s members, Mahes Raj Pant, stated, “The greatest contribution of this group was that it inspired the natives with the idea that given proper education, we can carry on research, and we ourselves are competent enough to reconstruct our past.” In the assessment of Yogesh Raj, the work of the Mandal contributed to “epistemic diversity” in historical knowledge production in post-Rana Nepal. Raj adds, “Mandal scholars took evidence as resources whose rigorous criticism would lead to a true and ‘scientific’ knowledge about the past.” Samsodhan Mandal’s Pathashala was plagued by financial problems from its very beginning. After an initial phase of great activity in the 1950s and 60s, it could not find the means to retain its students and reproduce itself in intergenerational terms. By the time of the death of its initiator, Naya Raj Pant, in November 2002, the school had been reduced to the guru and his two historian sons, Mahes Raj and Dines Raj Pant. While talking to a journalist in the immediate aftermath of the demise of the senior Pant, his two sons described their father’s attempt at an alternative to formal university-based education and degrees as a “failure”. The senior Pant and his sons have often said that, among other reasons, the antagonism of those whose work had been amended by the Mandal’s students led to the downfall of its Pathashala. In their view, given that those who were ‘attacked’ in its pamphlets were powerful members of Nepal’s intellectual elite, the latter conspired to disband the Pathashala. While there is no doubt that those whose works were ‘amended’ were mostly not pleased to have been put under the Mandal’s scanner, the idea of them getting together to conspire against the Pathashala’s institutional longevity is a bit hard to digest. The Pathashala initially succeeded because the pupils mostly adhered to the utopian visions of the guru Naya Raj Pant and participated in his experiment as his disciples. However, as they gradually became expert historians in their own right and had to earn a living to support their families, discordance between the fiscal needs of the pupils and the school’s inability to generate an income to keep it running became all too apparent. The school never had a system whereby the pupils were expected to pay regular fees to take lessons. In the early decades, the guru supported his family with his salary from the Ranipokhari Sanskrit Pathashala, and its scholars occasionally got some stipend from various sources (including Nepal Sanskritik Parisad) to critically edit historical texts. As part of their remit as trainees, the older students also tutored the younger ones in the Pathashala. Following the establishment of Tribhuvan University in 1959, university-credentialed individuals began to find jobs in new state, para-state and private institutions. By the early 1970s, the intergenerational transfer of knowledge began to be mediated by more complex institutions supported by the state and market forces. Hence, the Mandal’s Pathashala model and the vision of which it was a part, began to look less attractive to those who were already its members and to younger folks who were its potential members. When the late Dhanavajra Vajracharya, one of the Mandal’s most competent and committed members, quit it and joined TU in 1971, the attraction of this Pathashala was surely on the decline.  In the context of the immediate post-Rana Nepal, the experiment that was Samsodhan Mandal Pathashala was important because it established a firm tradition of Nepali historical scholarship based on a critical reading of the evidence. This school demonstrated what could be achieved through a commitment to a kind of historical scholarship that had been in practice in scholarly traditions in different parts of the world until the mid-20th century but mostly absent in Nepal. We should also note that the Pathashala was a home-grown effort that relied on the collaboration of several individuals for its success and for at least a few decades, its work provided one model of how Nepal Studies could be done in Nepal.  \nEighteen years after the decade-long Maoist insurgency (1996-2006) ended, there is finally some hope of justice for the victims. On Wednesday, the House of Representatives endorsed the bill to amend the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act 2014. (The bill has yet to pass the National Assembly and the President’s authentication, which will take some time.) This long-overdue amendment has also brought a much-needed relief for everyone who advocated for justice and reparation for those affected. The latest step will pave the way for completing the pending tasks of seeking truths about insurgency-era cases of violence and possible closures.Some provisions in the TRC Act called for amnesty to perpetrators of serious human rights violations. Several governments have been formed and toppled since the Supreme Court in 2015 directed the authorities to make necessary revisions to the Act. Years went by with no urgent actions, and justice remained a pipedream. Only recently did the leading parties—Nepali Congress, CPN-UML and Maoist Centre—heed the bill introduced by the former premier and Maoist chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal last year. Even though the bill has received a positive response from many quarters, including diplomats and heads of international organisations closely watching Nepal’s peace process, some human rights activists and victims are still concerned about some provisions in the bill. It categorises rape or serious cases of sexual violence, enforced disappearances and intentional killings as non-amnestiable, which is a sensible provision. But it allows for amnesty in other human rights violations cases and allows for reducing the sentence by up to 75 percent if perpetrators fulfil some set criteria except in rape or serious sexual violence cases, leaving space for manipulation. The bill also omits the issue of child soldiers used during the insurgency, and this is a serious concern. Given such flaws, there are genuine concerns as to whether the leaders are simply trying to end the chapter with minimal changes. That the major parties have come together to conclude this long-pending issue is laudable, but they shouldn’t use the bill to appease political factions or collect brownie points. The three leading party chairs—Sher Bahadur Deuba, KP Sharma Oli and Pushpa Kamal Dahal—marked the endorsement as a matter of national pride. Dahal, the chief architect of the insurgency, said he hoped it would “lead the country towards the conclusion of the peace process.” The first step the leaders should take is to work towards appointing officials to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission of the Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons, both of which have been left in limbo for over two years. The next step is to heed the concerns and disagreements of the stakeholders of the peace process and resolve them. The TRC dream will translate into reality only with an unwavering commitment to ensuring a just and respectful environment for the victims. It remains to be seen if the law will be implemented as promised and hoped. If not, it will betray the very principles of justice and reparation upon which Nepal’s peace process was founded.  \nWith the Paris 2024 Olympics concluding earlier this week, Nepali players have returned home. All seven athletes returned empty handed, having failed to break the 60-year spell of participating in Olympics without winning a medal. Those scratching their heads as to why Nepal has had a dry run all these decades needn’t look further than the Dasharath Stadium, located at the nerve centre of Kathmandu. The country’s most famous stadium was a sight to see on Tuesday. Nepal’s Church Boys United lost to Bhutan’s Paro FC, which was a shock for Nepali fans. But the match result was hardly a topic of discussion on Tuesday evening. Rather, it was the ground of the country’s only international-standard stadium hosting an international match. It was a messy affair on the ground as the 22 boys jostled for the ball, slipping on the puddled, muddy ground all the time. As the Nepali players struggled to clinch a win against the visiting team, the photographs circulating on social and mainstream media, of the players drenched in sludge, gave an early indication that Nepal was set to lose an image war internationally. The Japanese football icon Keisuke Honda, a member of the Bhutan squad, was right on point when he called the Bhadrakali ground a joke. It’s not clear whether Nepali authorities have taken Honda’s remark as an insult to Nepal or ignored it completely, but Honda, who has played three world cups for Japan, should be thanked for pointing out our pathetic state. The tamasha at the stadium exposed the state of our sports infrastructure and the insincerity of our authorities even when it comes to organising an international event.Alarmingly, the situation is no different in cricket, volleyball or martial arts. Nepali youths have tremendous interest and potential in sports, in addition to a fan base envied by the world. Impressed by our young talents, the international sports fraternity has shown unprecedented interest towards Nepal in recent years. But the authorities remain as lethargic as ever even to cash in on the international goodwill.There is no dearth of literature on the lackadaisical attitude of Nepali sports authorities. But there are some basics they should do immediately if Nepali sports is to get any better. First, the authorities must work to strengthen the financial security of the players. Only then we can expect better results from them. If the sportspeople are playing for the country, it is the country that should look after their needs. The prime ministers, ministers and other officials who compete to make big announcements after a Nepali team’s win in an international match should learn to walk the talk.Second, the authorities should work immediately to improve sports infrastructure. If the Dasharath Stadium is muddy, the Kirtipur Cricket Ground has no light. The Mulpani Cricket Stadium has taken decades to complete, and there are hardly any decent stadiums outside the capital city, and players are deprived of training and international exposure. The authorities must therefore ensure that the sports bodies strictly follow a calendar of events throughout the year from federal to the grassroots level to ensure a holistic development of the sector. If we continue to make the players dodge the sludge on their training ground, we cannot expect them to return home with international medals.  \nIndia’s new foreign secretary Vikram Misri returned to New Delhi on Monday after a 32-hour whirlwind tour around Kathmandu. Not much was expected of the visit, as it was supposed to be a courtesy call, a continuation of the tradition of Indian foreign secretaries visiting neighbouring countries after their appointment. So there were no significant breakthroughs in outstanding issues—just an exchange of pleasantries and congratulations over chiya-kaffee. A rendezvous with no agenda is a good thing once in a while—after all, neighbours can’t just engage in geopolitical hard talk all the time. However, here’s wishing the visiting dignitary had some time to step out of the prime ministerial and presidential chambers onto the streets. For the monsoon-battered, puddled roads reflect reality better than the glossy floors of Baluwatar and Sheetal Niwas. Having recently seen a diplomatic whodunnit in Bangladesh, Indian Babus would certainly want to touch base with ground reality in the neighbourhood.Nepal and Bangladesh have different political contexts, including in terms of parliamentary politics. Having faced Sheikh Hasina's seemingly tight grip on state affairs for over a decade and a half, Bangladeshis were fidgeting for a change as democracy was on the wane. With 13 government changes in 16 years, Nepal remains committed to democracy although Nepalis are looking for a change, seeking stability. India remained tight-lipped on the goings-on in Bangladesh even as Hasina sought a fourth consecutive term this January by keeping opposition leaders behind bars. Apart from being the biggest trade partner in South Asia, Bangladesh was a “friendly” nation to India, thanks to Hasina’s indebtedness to India from 1971 all the way to 2024. As long as the person of its liking was in power in Dhaka, India chose to remain silent to the calls for democracy, free press and fair elections in Bangladesh, only to jolt back to reality when the tide of change swept Hasina off her feet, and the comfort of dealing with a friendly ruler in the neighbourhood became a thing of the past.Luckily for Misri, things are not too bad in Nepal. But when was the last time a top Indian diplomat spoke about the report of the Eminent Persons Group that is collecting dust due to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s reluctance to so much as acknowledge it? When will India acknowledge Bhairahawa Airport as Nepal’s major development infrastructure and provide the air space for it to operate fully? And when will the Babus in New Delhi’s North Block stop using the language of Nepal, a supposed backyard of India, being taken over by China? When Misri returns to Nepal for a definitive diplomatic visit, he would want to come up with some fresh ideas and spend a bit more time to understand the subterranean tides of change. Nepal might have been ruled by old leaders milking their legacy of the 1990s politics when Misri was still a young foreign services officer in India, but the old Indian lenses used to look at Nepal now need replacing.  \nIt’s not a good sign for people to start questioning a government’s anti-corruption credentials barely a month after its formation. Yet they have choice but to do so with the government seemingly intent on giving a free pass to many corrupt officials and leaders. As per a bill currently under discussion in the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee of Parliament, a corruption case should be filed within five years of the knowledge of such an instance of corruption. (It is unclear who should have such knowledge.) Similarly, if an individual had been involved in corruption while being in a public position and could not be punished at the time, they too should be punished within five years of retirement. In fact, the bill was first registered by the then KP Sharma Oli government on January 20, 2020. It was passed and sent to Parliament on April 10, 2023. With Oli back in power, the bill, which is supposed to amend the Prevention of Corruption Act, 2059 (2002 AD) has now again come to the centrestage. The bill presented by the Oli government seems to have been inspired by a “forgive and forget” approach to corruption. It is so indefensible that even the MPs from the ruling parties are struggling to do it. Lawmakers of the opposition Maoist Centre and Rastriya Swatantra Party have also rightly pointed out that the deadline of five years is regressive. As it stands, the UML is the sole party in defense of the bill. If the other parties, both ruling and opposition, stick to their guns, the government will have to back down, and it should. For there is absolutely no rhyme or reason for the five-year cap; and were such a cap to be imposed, countless current and former politicians and bureaucrats who are soaked in corruption would walk scot-free. Nepal already ranks an alarming 108 of the 180 countries on Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index (CPI) 2023—below fellow South Asian countries Bhutan (26th), the Maldives (93rd) and India (93rd). Moreover, the conviction rate in corruption cases in 2021-22 stood at just 38.5 percent. If there is one thing the government should do at this time, it is to bring policies to reduce corruption and punish the corrupt with due diligence. However, it seems to want to take the opposite route.From instances of money laundering to land grabbing, selling diplomatic passports to turning citizens into refugees, corruption is widespread in Nepal. No political party is free from corruption, which is also exemplified by recent investigations into high-level politicians in the Lalita Niwas land grab scam, the gold smuggling scams, and the Bhutanese refugee scam. There is ample evidence of how no corrupt country can steadily move forward on the path of peace and prosperity. This is why, fighting corruption should be the top agenda of all big and small political parties that purport to work in national interest. Those who don’t do so deserve to be singled out and punished for doing irreparable harm to their country.  \nThe CPN (Maoist Centre) has either led or been a part of the government for most of the past decade and half. But the most recent Maoist Centre-led government under Pushpa Kamal Dahal was ousted only last month. Following this, the party’s senior leaders are in marathon meetings. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asked Giriraj Mani Pokharel, the Maoist Centre deputy general secretary, on the party’s review of the turn of events and its future strategy. The Maoist Centre is now out of the government. How does the party intend to go forward? We have started a series of party meetings to review the overall situation and to set the party’s agenda. We held a meeting of the office bearers that ran for five days. Now the party’s standing committee meeting is underway. After this, there will be a central committee meeting. That will take the final decisions on the party’s strategy and programmes for the coming days. In the meetings, the party chair has asked the leaders to discuss national as well as party issues frankly and honestly. At the end of the meeting, we will make an objective analysis of the overall situation and prepare an action plan.The Central Committee endorses the decisions. But the meetings of the office bearers and standing committee set the agenda and orientation for the party. What have you decided so far? On the national front, obviously, the dissolution of our government and formation of a new alliance is an issue. Leaders of the new coalition have said their alliance is for making changes in the constitution. They however are still not transparent. Based on their statements, it can be said that they are going against their own pledges. During the election campaign, they had said nothing about changing the constitution. You don’t find it in their manifestos as well. But in the middle of this five-year tenure, they have come up with a new agenda. A question arises: Can they change the constitution? Doesn’t that violate the mandate the parties got through the elections? Generally, the constitution might be reviewed after 10 years of its implementation. But we haven’t implemented it in a full-fledged way as we don’t even have all the laws required for its effective implementation. We have just agreed to conclude the remaining tasks of the peace process. So, the proposal to amend the constitution without first completing the basics required for its implementation is wrong. They want to make changes in the proportional inclusive system of our constitution. A political force can work to secure a majority in the House through general elections and ensure stability in the country. We accept that. We have also been lobbying for a directly elected executive president for political stability. They are not ready to debate on that. But they want to revoke the inclusive system, a major achievement of the 2006 people’s movement. This system has empowered historically excluded and deprived communities. We have to enhance the capacity of these groups instead of depriving them of their rights. If there are anomalies in the system’s implementation, let’s develop methods to more effectively pick our representatives. But the ruling parties seem intent on turning back the clock. Some leaders have publicly announced that they want to end the role of small parties. There can be a number of political parties in a country like Nepal, which is rich in social diversity. We adopted federalism for the same purpose. The leaders give priority to their family members and loyal ones while selecting election candidates and blame the constitution for the ensuing mistakes. They want to rule the country indefinitely through a two-party system. So we think the Congress-UML alliance is on the path of regression. Republicanism, federalism, secularism, inclusion and socialism-oriented systems are integrated five pillars of the present constitution. No attack on them will be tolerated. This is one focus of our ongoing meeting. We are also discussing some fresh international issues such as the developments in Bangladesh. We have yet to get a complete picture from there. But we can still learn some things. The centre of global affairs is changing and shifting to Asia. More importantly, there is a strong influence of such geopolitical forces in Nepal as well.Party chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal has said that there was an external hand in the recent change of coalition.External elements are active, in one way or the other. Some want to make our country a playground of external forces but our party and party chair firmly stood against it. The forces that wanted various things but didn’t get them from the government then started searching for a character suitable for them. People aren’t aware of such unseen elements but we should be careful. In the meeting, we are discussing this issue as well.Do you think geopolitics is the major reason for the ouster of the Dahal-led government?In his third term as a prime minister, Prachanda was working with certain priorities such as good governance, social justice and prosperity. He had taken governance seriously. Previously, there was a practice of exploiting state coffers in collusion between politicians, big businessmen and bureaucrats. The Prachanda-led government strongly stood against such a nexus. Actions against those involved in Bhutanese refugee scam, Lalita Niwas land grab, Bansbari Leather Shoe land scam, and gold smuggling are some examples. The government formulated a law to address the problems of loan shark victims. But some individuals associated with the coalition partners were involved in the scams. Were these bad elements linked to the Congress or the UML? Dahal entered into coalitions with both.The individuals were linked to partners in both the coalitions. The party chair made good governance his main priority but the Maoist Centre is the third-largest party so his hands were tied. When certain individuals were brought under investigation in corruption cases, the initiatives to change the government were expedited overnight. We can conclude that Prachanda government’s anti-corruption moves inspired other parties to oust it.You mentioned external interference as well as other parties’ fear of the government’s anti-corruption actions. Which one was the major reason for government change?The government’s anti-corruption drive is the main reason behind the formation of the new coalition. This drive brought the two largest parties together to form a government, which is unusual in the parliamentary system. The government is working to increase the threshold to secure seats under the proportional representation category. The proposed provision is against small parties, and the Maoist Centre has opposed this. Do you see the possibility of polarisation among the parties on this issue?When the ruling parties introduce new proposals that were not even discussed during the elections, we will definitely oppose them. We led the previous movements for people’s rights and we have to secure these rights. Thus the polarisation between those who want to trample on the statute and those who are against such attacks is inevitable. Is the Maoist Centre preparing to unify with other parties including the Nepal Communist Party led by Netra Bikram Chand Biplab?First, we are in the final stage of merging with the outfit of Mahindra Raya Yadav. Also, the Biplab-led party has endorsed the party unity proposal. We have to iron out some theoretical issues and make the party line clear in the changed national as well as international context. Dialogue between us is headed in the right direction.You earlier said party chair has urged other leaders to openly debate issues. Have they discussed why the Maoist party has lost its strength as well as the issue of the party chair holding leadership continuously for three and a half decades.Comrade Prachanda led the decade-long people’s war and subsequent political movements as well as the peace process, all of which made epochal changes in Nepal’s political history. No one can deny this. Therefore, Prachanda doesn’t need any position in the party. He is now a nationally as well as internationally established personality. But our party as well as the country needs him. Therefore, the discussions in the party are now aimed at making the best use of his personality in the larger interest of the society. As far as the reasons behind the setbacks we faced in the recent time are concerned, we had rightly assessed the situation in the past.But we couldn’t adapt to the changed context. We failed to develop our culture and lifestyle in line with our guiding ideology. Similarly, we failed to run the party in a proper way. We gave up our agendas and became power-centric. We developed anti-proletariat tendencies. We were gradually distanced from the public. Now we have decided that we must reestablish our relations with the working class and the oppressed. We have also failed to communicate about the important works we did when we were in the government. We need to tell the people what we did in their favour when we were in government in the past 15 years. There will also be some serious soul-searching.There is a perception that the Maoist Centre and its leaders are incapable of staying out of power.Our party’s general convention had decided to maintain a right balance in the party’s role in the government, Parliament and the street. It is true that we were in the past more engaged in the government. The party chair has already said that our focus won’t be the government from now on. \nWithin days of CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli and Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba reaching a deal to form a new government under Oli’s leadership, some Congress leaders including the two party general secretaries started doubting the deal’s implementation. Independent observers also have doubts over the longevity of the Congress-UML partnership. To get some insight, the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Congress Central Committee member Govind Raj Pokharel, who is also former vice-chair of National Planning Commission. Many have expressed doubt over the longevity of the Congress-UML alliance. What is your observation?There was a discussion in the political circles on the need for the Congress and the UML joining hands to address some serious problems the country has been facing for years. The issues of governance, flaws seen in the practice of the electoral system, and the national economy are some pressing issues that need to be addressed. In the meantime, the top leaders of the two largest parties reached a deal overnight. The dramatic turn of events made people suspect some unspoken reasons had brought the leaders of the two rival forces together. The leaders have stated that they joined hands mainly to review the constitution, to make changes in the electoral system, improve governance and address problems seen in the economic sector. These are the stated objectives. As far as my observation goes, people don’t have full faith in the leaders of the two parties because of past records. On the economic front, this coalition may achieve some improvements because both parties are on the same page. Both follow liberal economic ideas. Of late, even the UML has become increasingly liberal on economic issues. The private sector has welcomed the new alliance. There are already some signs of reforms. Their plan to make changes in the electoral system through constitutional amendment however is not easy. First, their numerical strength in the federal parliament, mainly in the upper house, is insufficient to amend the constitution. Such a move would be risky from a strategic perspective as well. Many groups and forces have reservations over various provisions of this constitution. Once they start the amendment process, it will be like opening Pandora’s Box. Thus I am optimistic only on the economic front. If they get that right, it will help address the society’s mass frustration.The two parties have cited the perennial political instability as a major reason behind their coming together. Can we now expect policy consistency as well?Political instability is an excuse to cover up their failures. Even the alliance of largest parties cannot guarantee political or policy stability. Numbers alone are not enough. Leaders also need to have a democratic culture and the capacity to manage emerging issues. Even governments led by a single party commanding up to two-thirds majority have failed. On certain occasions, coalition governments have done commendable jobs. Handling the post-quake situation and producing the constitution in 2015 were examples of big parties justifying their coalition. Thus even with some doubt, we can expect political stability and some economic reforms.The Congress unanimously endorsed the deal of party president Sher Bahadur Deuba and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli. But in public, leaders from the anti-establishment faction of the Congress don’t seem satisfied. Why this unease?The deal was made in a dramatic way without proper consultations with other leaders. At least those in the executive committees of the party should have been consulted. It is challenging for the Congress leaders to ally with their major rival, the UML. A cadre-based party, the UML’s style of governance is different to that of the Congress. When in government, the UML treats even government institutions, constitutional bodies and independent agencies as the party’s structures. Whereas the Congress allows more freedom to government agencies. So, there is a risk of the UML misusing state mechanisms while the Congress leaders are in the Cabinet. This is one big risk for the Congress. The second concern is the working style of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli. He is a towering personality, a hard-working leader, and with his strong command over his party organisation, he can swiftly implement any proposal. The Congress ministers who also have to listen to the concerns of the party’s top leaders may struggle to strike a balance. In Oli’s Cabinet, ministers are likely to get less freedom within their ministries. A rift is thus likely because of Prime Minister Oli’s working style.Why didn’t the Congress then send influential leaders to the Cabinet to check the prime minister?The leaders might not have been so interested in joining this government. They might have sensed intervention from the prime minister’s office and thought they might not be able to perform as per their expectation under Oli’s leadership. See, chiefs of the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre work in a dictatorial way. Once they are elected at the party convention for four years, they behave like dictators. They take decisions on their own without any consultations. People in Nepal often lobby for a directly-elected prime minister or President. I wonder what these leaders would do if they were directly elected as executive head. So, the problem is in the working style and attitude of our leaders, not in the constitution or the electoral system.Shekhar Koirala and Gagan Thapa had first pitched for joining hands with the UML to end ‘unnecessary bargaining’ of fringe parties. Suddenly, Deuba struck the deal with Oli. And, now Koirala and Thapa seem sceptical about the deal.The proposal of Koirala and Thapa was for Congress leading the government and the UML supporting it. In fact, Oli was ready to accept Congress leadership. He requested the Congress leaders to take the lead. Surprisingly, the negotiating team led by our party president reached an opposite deal. They offered government leadership to Oli.Then, could it be that, as some claim, Deuba and his wife Arzu were desperate to unseat Dahal fearing they could be dragged into corruption scams?I don’t know much about that scenario. But what I knew is that Oli was willing to join a Congress-led government.Why would Deuba, who is a very clever leader in making such give-and-take deals, have given up a chance to be prime minister right away?It’s true that all three party chiefs—Deuba, Oli and Dahal—are very clever in making deals in their own favour based on their numerical strength. A leader beats the other two on one occasion and on another, another of them comes out on top. It’s like a see-saw. This time Oli won the game.Congress General Secretaries Gagan Thapa and Bishwa Prakash Sharma have expressed suspicion over the implementation of the deal. Many say they did so as Deuba didn’t involve them in negotiations on power-sharing. Is it true?The party’s central work execution committee endorsed the deal signed by the two leaders. The leaders who participate in such meetings should speak up then and there if there is anything objectionable, instead of making such statements in public. Why didn’t they oppose it at the meeting? I don’t see any point in expressing doubt over the deal in public while endorsing the same in party committees.The two general secretaries also expressed doubt over Oli handing over government leadership to Deuba as per the agreement. Why this mistrust?The experience of the past two or three decades makes politicians suspicious of each other. Nepali politicians have hardly ever handed over government leadership easily. After four or five months of collaboration, some issues emerge and a rift is created. So, history makes us doubt that this coalition will last for three and half years. In the meantime, the party establishments have sidelined other factions when it comes to picking ministers, both at federal and provincial levels. When the government fails to perform as per expectation, party cadres of the ruling parties start criticising the government. Is it possible to amend the constitution as the two parties have announced?We can’t backtrack on the inclusive system. We must abide by the policy of inclusion in state agencies. The leaders who spoiled this system are saying that the proportional representation (PR) system is not working. But there is room to make our three-tier federal system more cost-effective. People get irritated when they see a large number of representatives benefitting from state coffers. We can bring down the number of local units from 753 to around 400. However, there should be sufficient wards as those units are directly involved in service delivery while the Palikas are more engaged in development activities. The number of ward members can also be decreased. In provinces, we don’t need PR seats as those elected from the provincial constituencies automatically represent the local communities. Likewise, the provincial cabinets can be downsized. Thus we can downsize the number of people who benefit from state coffers. This is vital to make the federal system sustainable. Similarly, we can rightsize the number of PR seats by adopting a rotational constituency for women, dalits and other marginalised communities. Only the candidates from underrepresented sections will compete in those constituencies. This will help elect competent people even from within the targeted communities. This is how we can address some concerns without compromising the inclusive system envisioned in the constitution.Why has the Congress picked gangsters and tainted individuals as ministers in provinces?The selection of such controversial individuals as ministers and policy makers will damage the party’s image. People are going to raise this issue seriously. In fact the pace of criminalisation and commercialisation of Nepali politics is faster than the political reform being undertaken to clean up politics.It seems intellectual leaders are being sidelined while gangsters are being promoted. Why is it happening?Because people from intellectual or political backgrounds voice critical views and leaders don’t like it. They speak what their conscience says is right. For instance, leaders like Mahesh Acharya and Minendra Rijal aren’t given any role in the party. It is a common problem in all the major political forces in Nepal.Is the space for leaders with intellectual backgrounds and having critical views being squeezed?The Congress used to be a very liberal organisation. But it has also become illiberal and leaders have become increasingly intolerant. All leaders—whether the seniors or young ones—are becoming less tolerant even of constructive criticism. Party leaders haven’t spoken against the selection of gangsters as ministers. Even the office bearers who are in decision making bodies and can change the decisions are silent now. This is dangerous. This is an example of how critical voices are sidelined.Haven’t the two young general secretaries been able to raise hope in the Congress?They are working like central committee members. General secretaries should be able to intervene while making crucial policy decisions. They can stop the party committees from making wrong decisions. But they are risk-averse. They are not taking the risk to fight the powerful party establishment.Historically, in all parties there is a trend of its anti-establishment faction bargaining for 40-45 percent seats in the party or government. If they don’t get an acceptable power sharing deal, they don’t cooperate with the party leadership. Is it a healthy democratic practice?Intra-party competition compels the leaders to do this. The ruthless establishment always sidelines party members and leaders if they aren’t loyal. So, the leadership of the anti-establishment has to protect such cadres because the rival factor too needs a strong support base of cadres to compete against the powerful establishment. Party establishments are strong due to centralised resources and other factors, so you need an equally strong force to compete against them. \nScores of people have been killed in landslides, floods and other monsoon-induced disasters within a month of the monsoon entering Nepal in the second week of June. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asks Jagadishwor Karmacharya, director general of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, what the department is doing to save people from disasters and whether our system is ready to cope with the challenges posed by climate change.Where is Nepal in terms of technology and expertise when it comes to forecasting the ever-changing weather patterns?If we compare to our situation a decade ago, we have made significant progress in setting up meteorological stations, collecting real-time data and increasing the frequency of weather predictions. We get rainfall data from around 350 stations, while we receive information about temperature and other related parameters from around 150 stations. We have an additional 175 centres to collect information about water levels. Our servers get real-time data every 10 minutes from all these stations. Besides that, we also have manual data collection centres. Thus, we have around 800 data collection centres in total. But we haven’t been able to set up enough stations in the Himalayan range due to difficult topography, low presence of government agencies and other factors. Also, we release radiosonde balloons to collect data on temperature, humidity and wind speed from the upper levels of the atmosphere. Overall, we have made huge strides in using technologies in the past decade, but it is still insufficient to cater to people’s expectations. They want specific weather information about their present location or destination. The expectation is valid. But our complex and diverse topography and meteorological phenomenon—ranging from the Tarai belt to the Himalayan range—makes accurate forecasts challenging. Kaski’s Lumle sees maximum rainfall in the country, and around 40 km north of it, the Jomsom area sees negligible rain. So great variability within a short distance adds to the challenge of forecasting.Do we have sufficient stations to cater to that variability?We need more stations because the higher you go, the more variabilities you find. In the plains, the weather pattern is more homogenous, while it is highly heterogeneous in the hills. In Tarai, even a station in around 100-150 kilometres may work because there is less variability of temperature as well as rainfall. But we need more stations in the hills where rain patterns drastically change.Are our methods and technologies being updated over time?Until around a decade ago, the forecasters used to predict based on their experience and the data received every three hours from the synoptic weather stations of Nepal and other neighbouring countries. At the time, we used to predict weather only for a day. Now, we synthesise the data collected from our systems and those from the modelling centres from India, China and other countries. Now, we can forecast for three days.Our capacity has significantly increased mainly in observing real time happenings. As I said, we take updates from hundreds of stations every 10 minutes. We also take satellite pictures from 16 channels of Japan’s Himawari Satellite, which has stationed its receiver in Nepal as well, also every 10 minutes. Until over a decade ago, we used to receive satellite pictures just once or twice a day. Even those pictures weren’t as good as those we get these days. We used to update surface-related data in three hours and upper air data in 12 hours. Based on that, we made a weather forecast for the next 12 hours. In comparison, we now have a large number of hydrological and meteorological real-time observation stations, the updates from Himawari and other satellites every 10 minutes and we have three radars to gather information. With the help of these technologies, now we can get immediate real-time updates. It helps us analyse the data of past hours and predict possible scenarios of the next six to 12 hours. We inform people accordingly. But we have to work more on the technology to make longer forecasts. Despite these progresses, we are still 15-20 years back in comparison to the technologies used by developed countries. We are behind in research. We need more expertise and an upgrade of our technology. Nepal doesn’t have its own satellite. Is this problematic?On the weather observation part, our work has not been hampered because we get data from the satellites of India, China and Japan. On the communication part, we are getting support from telecom companies—NTC and NCell—to transfer data. It covers most parts of the country. Absence of a satellite of our own is less of a concern compared to our other needs.Climate change has brought about massive changes in weather patterns. Do we have sufficient expertise to cope with this?The organisational structure and positions in our department haven’t changed much in over three decades. Demand for our work has drastically increased in the past two decades but we haven’t been able to cater to the demand. We need engineers capable of working with the latest technologies but we don’t have positions for such professionals in our current structure. We have procured some technologies and got some from our donors. But we don’t even have experts to use that as well.As you said, the department has made progress in the past decade but in this period climate change has progressed even faster. How do we keep up with this change?We face new challenges almost every year. In the past couple of years, mountain districts such as Manang and Mustang have not only witnessed rainfalls but also heavy downpours that even swept away bridges and other structures. Last year, over 30 hydropower projects were badly damaged by floods in eastern Nepal. The floods that wreaked havoc in Melamchi in 2021 were unprecedented. These incidents are evidence that climate change has already started to show unusual patterns and cause damages in this Himalayan range. We will face extreme weather patterns like long droughts and heavy rainfalls.The Dodhara weather station of Kanchanpur recorded 624mm of rainfall in 24 hours earlier this month. This is a new record. Before that, 540mm was the highest rainfall recorded, around two decades ago. Upward shifting of snowline in the mountains and formation of glacial lakes are other indications of the impacts of climate change. Don’t you think it’s already late to restructure government agencies, review policies and even redesign our systems?That is necessary. Devastation in Melamchi is one example that suggests the same. While developing such projects, we have to seriously consider possible impacts of climate change. Even if they analyse the possible scenario, they refer to the data of the past few decades. But things are changing so fast, decisions based on old data might not be useful. So, it is becoming more challenging to make projections. Design guidelines definitely need to be updated. Our division lacks policies, let alone updated ones. Though we are issuing red alerts and carrying out other tasks on scientific grounds, we don’t have a legal basis even to do these things.A large number of people in Nepal die in floods and landslides every year. Can we tweak our forecast system to save more lives?We have succeeded in reducing the deaths by floods in comparison to the loss we used to incur until 8-10 years ago. Earlier, we didn’t have flood alert service. It has been around a decade since we started the dedicated flood service. These days, we send mass SMS to the people of areas where floods may cause damage and for that we collaborate with telecoms—NTC and Ncell. We also work with district authorities and I/NGOs mainly in flood-prone districts to run campaigns and conduct drills. This has been quite effective. We are also taking similar initiatives in collaboration with telecom companies and other agencies to inform people on 13 various hydro-meteorological hazards such as, rains, lightning, winds.Working on floods is comparatively easier as it has certain catchment areas and we can focus on specific areas. So our efforts yield results. But in other incidents we can’t focus on certain areas. In floods, we inform the people hours before the flood so that they can shift to safe places. In the past, the death toll from floods used to be the highest. Now there are more deaths from landslides and lightning. We need to work more to give accurate information on lightning as well. Landslides vulnerability has increased due to extreme weather patterns, the impact of 2015 earthquake and rampant road construction.Why don’t people in Nepal follow and rely on weather forecasts? Is it due to negligence or lack of reliability of the prediction?It might be both. If the forecast doesn’t match reality, they may not follow or rely on us. So we need to improve our accuracy. Secondly, we need to increase awareness. Moreover, the weather isn’t as predictable as it used to be. So, we should keep on working, improving accuracy and making people aware. Many rely on international forecasts but not our own. Is our system less efficient?There are two aspects. One is getting accurate information and the second is user-friendly and attractive visual presentation of data, such as in mobile apps. We lag in the second part. Also, people want specific information about their locality and their intended destination. In the past, we used to give information by dividing the country in major regions such as eastern, central, western parts, tarai and hills. Now we have narrowed it down to each district. We need to work more on research.Have we succeeded in connecting weather forecasts to people’s livelihoods?The United Nations has launched the ‘Early Warning For All’ initiative to ensure that everyone on Earth is protected from hazardous weather, water, or climate events through life-saving early warning systems by the end of 2027. Various stakeholders need to join hands to implement it effectively as it has various components. Our expertise is to give as accurate information as we can. We give inputs but there are other agencies that go to the community level and work with the people.What are the things that need to be done in the changed context?We shouldn’t limit our work to simple forecasting but move to impact-based forecasts. For instance, we issue a seven-day Agromet Advisory Bulletin in collaboration with Nepal Agricultural Research Council which includes a summary on weather, crops, livestock, tables on weather and agrometeorological parameters, current weather information along with weather forecast (outlook). In a similar way, we can work with stakeholders on road transport as well. Then, we can make our forecast impactful, connect the general people and win their trust. But that requires proper policies and laws, updating this department’s organisational structure and enhancing the capacity of our human resource. \nToday, Gandaki Province, Lumbini Province, Karnali Province, and Sudurpaschim Province are expected to experience generally to mostly cloudy conditions, while the remaining provinces will see partly to generally cloudy skies.
