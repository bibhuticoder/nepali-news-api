Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nAmid widespread deaths and devastation caused by monsoon across various districts, Nepal is at a heightened risk for water-borne, vector-borne, and air-borne disease outbreaks.With most water sources contaminated by rain and floodwater, and thousands of displaced people living in makeshift shelters, experts have warned of a potential surge in infections in the coming days.“People are already getting infected with water-borne, vector-borne and air-borne diseases,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “These problems could worsen in the coming days.” At least 209 people have been confirmed dead, while 29 others are still missing due to the floods and landslides triggered by record-breaking torrential rainfall that started Thursday evening. Additionally, 142 people have sustained various degrees of injury, and more than 4,222 others have been taken to safe places, the Home Ministry said on Monday evening. Doctors warn that the risk of water-borne, vector-borne and air-borne disease outbreaks increases in the aftermath of disasters. Nepal’s past experiences suggest the same.“People are already contracting cholera and other water-borne diseases,” said Dr Pun. “As displaced people mostly live in temporary shelters, the chances of spread of air-borne and vector-borne diseases remain high.”At least 95 people from various districts, including from Kathmandu and Lalitpur, have tested positive for cholera since the start of the monsoon in June. The Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool samples of the infected patients. Thousands of others were also infected with diarrheal infections after the start of the monsoon season. Diarrhoeal disease is a common and seasonal public health issue, usually triggered by unsafe food and water or hygiene issues. Likewise, six people died, and 12,644 others were hospitalised this year due to dengue, which has spread to 76 out of 77 districts across the country. Hundreds of people are contracting seasonal flu, but health authorities have no records of these cases.Officials at the Ministry of Health and Population said that they are bracing for tough days ahead, as the floodwaters not only contaminate drinking water sources but also create breeding grounds for various disease-spreading vectors.“We expect a surge in water-borne, vector-borne and air-borne diseases in the coming days, as it takes a few days for these illnesses to incubate,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “We have alerted all agencies concerned to step up vigilance and prepare to deal with any adverse situations.”Public health experts have warned that healthcare facilities in the disaster-hit districts could witness an uptick in cases of viral fever cases and waterborne diseases—diarrhoea, dysentery, food poisoning—and snakebites.Health Ministry officials say that they are aware of the risks and have directed agencies concerned to prepare accordingly.“We have stockpiled essential medicines in districts, provinces and at the central level,” said Dr Roshan Pokhrel, the secretary at the ministry. “Responding to the looming outbreaks is not only the responsibility of the Health Ministry, but also of other ministries and agencies, and we have been coordinating with them as well.”In addition to stepping up surveillance measures, stockpiling medicines, and deploying medics at the health facilities in disaster-hit areas, public health experts emphasise the importance of health awareness in reducing infections.They say a combination of careful surveys, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining hygiene and sanitation, social mobilisation and treatment are required to contain the possible outbreaks of various ailments.The monsoon in Nepal is itself a season of epidemics with thousands of people across the country getting infected with water-borne and vector-borne diseases.The country is one of the world’s most vulnerable to the climate crisis and has witnessed extreme weather events over the past decade and a half.Evidence suggests that the maximum temperature in Nepal is rising at a greater rate (0.056 degrees Celsius per year) than the global average of 0.03 degrees Celsius per year.Experts say extreme weather events—excess rainfall in a short period, continuous rains for several days after the monsoon, dry spells, droughts, below-average precipitation, and above-normal winter temperatures—have become more frequent in Nepal.In recent years, scientists have gathered credible evidence linking the climate crisis to adverse health effects that impact the quality of life and kill people. \nNearly 900 people, including foreign trekkers, have been rescued by helicopters from different flood-hit areas in the last two days after severe flooding and landslides disrupted vehicular movement across Nepal.Rishiram Tiwari, spokesperson of the Home Ministry, said Nepal Army choppers rescued 683 people—425 people on Sunday and 258 on Monday. “The rescue is ongoing,” he said. “Apart from disaster response conducted by the Nepal Army, private choppers have also been rescuing stranded foreigners, particularly in the mountain region.”The exact number of rescues conducted by private choppers is unknown, but operators said roughly 200 foreign trekkers and a few Nepalis have been evacuated in the last two days. Most highways across Nepal have been blocked by landslides and fallen trees, leaving thousands of travellers stranded. As a precaution, the government has banned nighttime bus service on some highways. According to the Home Ministry statement, the death toll from the landslides and flooding has risen to 209. Twenty-nine others are missing.The Nepal Army conducted emergency rescue operations in Kavrepalanchok and Sindhuli after the BP Highway was cut off, leaving hundreds of people stranded.The Airlines Operators Association of Nepal, the apex body of private operators, said they have been conducting rescues from the Everest region, Simikot, Manaslu, Langtang, Manthali, and other areas. Murali Dhar Joshi, the association's spokesperson, said an estimated 150 trekkers were stranded in Lukla, the gateway to the Everest region, after flights were affected since Thursday after heavy rains. “Flights have now resumed in Lukla, and we are evacuating trekkers,” he said. “We have also rescued trekkers from Khare and Lobuchee in the Everest region, who were stranded by the snowfall,” said Joshi of Simrik Air.He said that since it is trekking season, the movement of trekkers from Kathmandu to Lukla may rise in the coming days. Anil Manandhar, Corporate Manager at Shree Airlines, said they have been conducting rescues of both foreigners and Nepali citizens from different mountain areas, including Nepalthok in Kavrepalanchok.“On Monday, we rescued 25 people from different places.”According to him, nine Nepalis were rescued from Nepalthok, four (three foreigners and a Nepali) from Manang, three foreign trekkers from Langtang, and five foreign trekkers from Namchhe in the Everest region on Monday.Ramechhap Airport at Manthali, used for flights ferrying trekkers to Lukla during the peak season, has also been flooded. “The airport has since reopened, and foreigners were flown to Kathmandu,” said Joshi.Meanwhile, choppers have started airlifting hundreds of foreign mountaineers and trekkers stranded in Samagoan of Gorkha, to Kathmandu after protesting locals of Tsum Nubri Rural Municipality, in the Nepal-China border, were invited by the Home Minister to resolve the issue through talks.The locals of northern Gorkha have been protesting against the government for the last two weeks, demanding that Tsum Nubri rural municipality be removed from the list of restricted areas and chopper rescue operations be made easier. Nima Lama, chairman of Tsum Nubri Rural Municipality, said they are holding a discussion with the Home Ministry officials on Tuesday in Kathmandu. “The government has established a security camp at the border, and hence, there is no need to keep Tsum Nubri rural municipality in the restricted list,” he said. “Why do foreigners get a flying permit instantly, but locals have to wait for weeks for a rescue or medical evacuation flight? People are dying here due to slow emergency response.”Locals have also called for emergency rescue operations based on police recommendations, bypassing the existing lengthy approval process.Nearly 600 foreigners were stranded after the locals barred choppers from landing in the area.According to Lama, 40 evacuation flights were conducted on Monday after the protest was suspended on Sunday.Upper Mustang, upper Dolpo, Manaslu, lower Dolpo, upper Gorkha, Rasuwa, Manang, Humla, Mugu, Makalu, Kanchenjunga, Gunsha in Taplejung, and a few areas in Dolakha are among the restricted areas in Nepal where even helicopters cannot enter without a special permit.The process of obtaining a permit is so long that patients requiring urgent medical care risk dying before help arrives. The restricted areas lie along the northern border with China. In these places, lengthy official procedures must be completed to fly sick or injured persons to hospitals.According to a representative of a helicopter company, to get a permit, they have to make the rounds of the Home and Tourism ministries and the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal. There are many cases of sick or injured people dying by the time the permit is finally granted, the representative said.According to helicopter operators, there are typically six steps involved in obtaining a permit for medical evacuation flight. First, the family chartering the flight has to submit a request in writing to the chief district officer of the district concerned, and also provide a copy of the application to the helicopter company.Second, the helicopter company must write separately to the chief district officer. Third, after the application is verified, the chief district officer writes to the Home Ministry recommending that a permit be issued.Fourth, the Home Ministry issues a permit based on the identity of the sick or injured person.Fifth, the Home Ministry writes to the Tourism Ministry stating that security issues have been cleared and the helicopter may be granted a permit. Finally, the Tourism Ministry writes to the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal to issue a permit.On different occasions, the former parliamentary International Relations Committee directed the government to make arrangements for issuing helicopter rescue permits in restricted areas through local administrations. However, the directive has not been heeded.The House panel issued the directive following complaints about an increase in the number of deaths caused by delays in medical evacuation flights due to complex paperwork.  \nAs the rain-induced landslides have damaged the major roads connecting Kathmandu Valley with the rest of the country, the Prithvi Highway is likely to witness more traffic during the upcoming Dashain festival.Officials at the Department of Roads said that as other roads are unlikely to be ready for use, the only option for those travelling to and from the Valley will be the Kathmandu-Mugling highway, even as the highway itself is in a shoddy condition following heavy rainfall.Bus operators point to the need for government agencies to work on a war-footing to ease festive travel.“When major highways connecting Kathmandu Valley are disrupted, the only functional one, the Prithvi Highway, will be in high use during Dashain,” Amit Kumar Sharma, information officer at the Department of Roads, told the Post. “But the highway itself is disrupted at different places.”Thanks to efforts of the Nepal Army, the Armed Police Force, the Nepal Police and other agencies, the Prithvi Highway, which was disrupted since Saturday, has now become functional.However, according to the officer of the department, under Nagdhunga-Mugling section, two-way roads have been opened in Mauwa Khola, Hukdikhola, Fishling, Kalikhola, Simaltal, Jalbire, and Ghoptebhir sections. However, as of this writing, vehicular movement was open only one-way along the Jhyaple Khola and Jawang Khola sections, both of which are key routes into the capital city.“Even though there are some disturbances, the Prithvi Highway has now become functional,” acting spokesperson of traffic police Rabin Karki told the Post. “If there is no disruption by further rainfall, the highway will be fully functional before Dashain.”Dashain, a major Hindu festival, starts on October 3 and will be celebrated until October 14. Last year, almost 1.5 million people left Kathmandu Valley for their home districts during Dashain, according to the Nepal Transport Entrepreneurs Association. Bus operators, however, expect the number to decline this year due to the hassles in travel owing to poor roads.According to the department of roads, the BP Highway, which connects most of the eastern parts of the country with the Kathmandu Valley, is disrupted at Nepalthok, Kavre. The vehicles that come through Bardibas will be stopped in Nepalthok, says the officer of the road department.“Due to the difficult topography of the road section, this highway will take a few more days to be fully functional,” Sharma, the information officer of the road department, said. “A team from our department is in the field to collect detailed information.”Likewise, Kanti Rajpath, the other highway connecting Kathmandu to Tarai districts through Makawanpur, is also not in good condition due to damages caused by incessant rains.In this section of the highway, the damage caused by heavy rainfall on the bridges pose a big challenge for the resumption of vehicular movement. “Although we repaired the highway, the road might not be usable for vehicular movement during Dashain,” Sharma said.The heavy rains also disrupted the Araniko Highway. The road department office says even though people can travel up to Barhabise and Jiri via this highway, the connection to China has been disrupted. The condition of the Mid-hill Highway that connects several hill districts is not good either.Sharma says the road department plans to create diversion roads on various highways targeting Dashain. “Considering the movement of hundreds of thousands of people during Dashain, the department will soon make diversion roads on BP Highway, Mid-hill Highway and Mechi Highway, all of which were badly hit by recent rainfalls,” Sharma added.Bijay Swar, chair of the National Transport Entrepreneurs’ Association, says that despite their preparations, persistent rain, floods, and landslides could still have a big impact on people’s travel plans this Dashain. After the disruption of the BP Highway, Kanti Rajpath could have been used as an alternative but the highway is also in poor condition. “Now we only have the option of Prithvi Highway,” Swar told the Post.If the government does not declare an emergency in public transport and work on a fast-track basis to make the roads functional, the Dashain trips could be full of hassles, officials say.Apart from the poor road condition, another major challenge during Dashain would be old vehicles, which often break down in the middle of the road, causing traffic jams. But traffic police say they have a plan to manage such vehicles.“We will coordinate with various state agencies, especially at the district level, to ensure that people will have no difficulty travelling during Dashain,” acting spokesperson of traffic Karki said. \nNepal, India and Bangladesh are scheduled to sign a landmark agreement on Thursday to export 40 megawatts of electricity generated in Nepal to Bangladesh.The tripartite agreement will involve the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA), NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Limited of India, and the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB). Under the terms of the agreement, the NEA will receive 6.40 US cents per unit of electricity. The Indian side is involved in the deal as Nepal and Bangladesh are using the transmission line of India to transmit the energy through the territory of the southern neighbour.Originally scheduled for July 28, the signing was postponed due to political tension and change of government in Bangladesh.Chiranjeevi Chataut, spokesperson for the Ministry of Energy, Water Resources, and Irrigation, said meetings at the energy secretary and joint-secretary levels will be held in Kathmandu on Tuesday and Wednesday to complete all the preparations for the agreement.The NEA plans to sell electricity to Bangladesh annually during the rainy season, from June 15 to November 15. The expected export is 144,000 megawatt-hours, and the NEA estimates earnings of USD 9.216 million over these five months.Electricity will be exported to Bangladesh via the Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur 400 kV transmission line, with the metering point in Muzaffarpur. The NEA will bear any technical losses incurred in the transmission line from Dhalkebar to Muzaffarpur.Electricity will reach Bangladesh through the 400 kV transmission line from Beharampur (India) to Bhedamara (Bangladesh). The NEA intends to export electricity generated from its 25-megawatt Trishuli project and 22-megawatt Chilime project, both of which have received approval for electricity exports to India.On December 6, 2023, Bangladesh’s Cabinet Economic Affairs Committee granted in-principle approval for importing 40 megawatts of electricity from Nepal. Subsequently, BPDB issued a tender for the purchase of electricity for five years, in line with the tripartite agreement among Nepal, Bangladesh, and India, on January 1.A team from the NEA held discussions with the BPDB’s tender evaluation committee on February 22 in Dhaka. Nepal initially proposed a price of 6.70 US cents per unit; however, an agreement could not be reached as Nepal insisted on not offering a lower price than that charged to India. After bilateral discussions at the SAARC Energy Secretary-level meeting hosted by the World Bank in Singapore, Bangladesh agreed to a reduced price of 6.40 US cents.Although an agreement on the price was reached, the Bangladesh Cabinet’s Public Procurement Committee only approved the import price on June 11. After evaluating the submitted tender documents, BPDB informed the NEA on July 7 of its intent to accept the tender.The NEA confirmed its acceptance of the tender and promptly received a draft of the electricity sales agreement from BPDB. The NEA then scheduled the agreement date and invited BPDB on July 10.However, the deal became uncertain following widespread protests against the government in Bangladesh, which led to the resignation of then-prime minister Sheikh Hasina. Despite this, the interim government’s Chief Adviser Mohammad Yunus assured that importing electricity from Nepal would continue, paving the way for the forthcoming agreement.___ \nNepal and the United States have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to establish a bilateral consultation mechanism. The agreement was signed by the US Under Secretary for Political Affairs John Bass and Minister for Foreign Affairs Arzu Rana Deuba.“This agreement will deepen cooperation in areas such as trade, investment, tourism, and infrastructure, strengthening the foundation for meaningful and mutually beneficial collaboration between Nepal and the United States,” Foreign Minister Rana said in a post on X. Typically, such bilateral consultation mechanisms are led by the foreign secretaries of the respective countries. These meetings take place alternately and discuss the full scope of bilateral relations. Nepal has arrangements similar to those of several other nations.Following the MoU signing, Foreign Minister Rana and Under Secretary Bass exchanged views on key issues of mutual interest.According to Nepal’s Embassy in Washington, D.C., the MoU will enable senior officials from Nepal’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the US State Department to hold periodic consultations, alternating between Kathmandu and Washington, D.C., to discuss the entirety of Nepal-US relations.Foreign Minister Rana will depart for Doha, leading Nepal’s delegation at the Asia Cooperation Dialogue (ACD) Summit, before returning to Kathmandu. Prior to this, she attended the 79th United Nations General Assembly in New York. \nOn April 26, 2024, sidhakura.com, an online portal, disseminated a series of malicious audio-video content involving the chairs of two media houses. The fake content even dragged the Supreme Court, citing that the two chairs had met incumbent and former SC justices and senior advocates to dismiss over 400 corruption court cases. When the misleading content spread, the judicial body immediately responded, launching a suo moto contempt of court case against the portal’s publisher and editor. After months of investigation, the court on Sunday issued a final verdict and showed the prison’s door to the guilty. In addition to the portal’s publisher and editor, who got a prison sentence of three months each, another person, who supposedly conducted the infamous ‘sting operation’ on the portal’s behalf got six months in jail. Such harsh sentencing was due, and it gives a clear message that anyone who peddles false news in the name of journalism will be severely punished. The timely verdict also draws a clear line between free speech and disinformation and misinformation. The online portal’s claims were based on false premises and ambiguities. First, without any regard for media ethics, the editor and the publisher sensationalised the content, relying on an unverified audio clip provided by a third party. Second, when the Supreme Court and Press Council Nepal summoned them to be present at the court with evidence to substantiate their reports, they failed to do so. The sidhakura content unfortunately represents one of many cases of fake news that have surfaced in Nepal with the advent of new forms of technology, which in turn undermines democracy and the rule of law. Whether on social media platforms or traditional media outlets, disinformation intended to mislead people and misinformation with outright lies have become all too common. The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) has escalated the problem with the help of deepfakes—audio recordings, video clips or images replicating someone else’s identity using AI tools to spread false information. Deepfakes have been used not only to damage reputations but also to ‘report’ on events that are impossible in real life. In the recent tragic flooding and other natural disasters, deepfake videos simulating various kinds of calamities have been circulated, either to get views and likes or to spread fear. Fake news and deepfakes have also affected elections in many countries this year.Nepal’s Electronic Transaction Act, the umbrella law covering such cases, is limited in scope, primarily focused on traditional forms of crimes like digital fraud and identity theft. It doesn’t address emerging threats brought about by artificial intelligence. A new law to incorporate these has thus become vital. As important is sensitising people about the consequences of defaming other people through news outlets or social media platforms. The precedent set by Sunday’s ruling will help. While the media must be free to investigate and report on sensitive issues, this freedom cannot be misused to spread baseless rumours. Sunday’s verdict can be a good place to start the much-needed conversation on the regulation of various kinds of media. This debate will have to be extensive and nuanced as it is so easy to err in this case, either on the side of too much caution or too much liberty. \nAccording to police reports, by Monday evening, the freak monsoon downpour and the resultant flooding and mudslides over the weekend have claimed over 200 lives. About 127 people have been injured, and 56 are still missing. The government claims that some 4,022 stranded people on the damaged highways and flooded zones across Nepal have been successfully rescued. There are no official figures on the loss of lives and properties in the Kathmandu Valley and beyond.Yet, every patch of dark cloud in the sky seems ominous. Weather experts have warned of more heavy rains in the coming days. However, what is most worrying is the government's lack of preparedness. Returning from the UN General Assembly Meeting in the United States on Monday, Prime Minister Khadka Prasad Sharma Oli said that he hadn’t even imagined this level of flooding in Kathmandu.A national disaster People call this a natural disaster; I’d rather call it a national disaster of epic proportions. The government, led by a coalition of the two largest parties—the Nepali Congress and the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist Leninist)—miserably failed to not only protect people’s lives but also, according to its admission, to coordinate the resources and manpower to save them. Even Balen Shah, the Mayor of Kathmandu Metropolitan City, who has made quite a name for himself by doing some remarkable works in the capital city, failed to mobilise his offices. He announced the dispatch of 300 city police personnel only after the river systems here had flooded tremendously and claimed some lives. How pathetic!True, he may not be able to do much in such an unplanned and unmanaged capital town. He has done his best to destroy some illegal constructions and somehow restore the old glory. Shah has also displayed his zeal for discovering and reviving, albeit with limited success, some traditional river systems that have been legally or illegally buried under the concrete for centuries. In this effort, the mayor has fought with many parties and the traditional court systems. Yet, this time, the charismatic mayor had no substantial disaster management plans. Some members of the political parties, including those from the opposition, the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre), volunteered to search and rescue people buried alive in the mud. I wish more people were deployed by parties and other organisations to serve the needy in the affected areas. But this is not enough. It’s time all parties, big and small, took the issue of natural disasters more seriously. It’s important to revitalise the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority, appoint exporters and allocate more resources instead of merely using them as a tool to appease party workers. To achieve this and other vital things, there must be a robust debate in the Parliament, including in state legislatures, about how best to tackle the recurring problem of landslides and flooding. They should get the help of experts in the area and international experts to design policies and programmes for preventing and swiftly dealing with natural catastrophes. What we’ve just witnessed has been a national disgrace. Even the vehicles and people buried in Jhyaple Khola—very close to Kathmandu and next to the starting point of the near-complete underground tunnel system built by Japan—were dug out of the mud after many hours. What took so long? Good use of helicopters?We may be too poor to own an airforce; defence-wise, it’s not essential either. However, the least the government could do is engage dedicated army helicopters in disaster management. Importantly, as some retired police officers have publicly stressed, it’s time the Nepal Police had its own helicopters suitable for swift action, at least for the aid of communities nestled in remote hills and mountains. If parties are serious about this problem, they should stop using government helicopters to carry leaders to every nook and corner of the country—especially for partisan events. If they want to use them, they should pay separately. There must be a strict check and balance on this matter. This way, much of the resources wasted in the service of big or influential leaders could be channelled to people badly hit by floods and landslides. The language of disasterOn Monday, in an article in Setopati, veteran journalist and writer Narayan Wagle claimed that we have never tried to understand the “language” of disasters. He says that every natural disaster, including the big 2015 Gorkha Earthquakes, makes a statement, but neither the government nor people understand its meaning. He blamed mainly the journalists for their persistent enthusiasm to report the quantities of deaths and injuries but little interest in debating possible ways to minimise the harm. I agree with Wagle: We all need to do some serious soul-searching about our attitude to natural calamities and their deadly impacts. Only when we, the members of civil society, are sensitive to the issue can we hold the government accountable. Needless to say, much of our civil society is linked to political parties and national and international non-government organisations. The ruling CPN (UML) boasts the largest number of members who either run or work for NGOs and INGOs. These bodies also have more resources and, in some cases, expertise. Working with the government at all levels through party channels, they could and should play a vital role in raising sensitivities towards the problem of disaster management.Disaster prevention and management is one of the few areas which is relatively non-political and uncontroversial. Parties on the left, right or centre wouldn’t object to the policies and programmes for disaster mitigation and management. And, of course, foreign government and non-government agencies would readily offer a hand with financial resources and expertise. I’m pretty certain that all donors would be willing to help the Nepal Police and Nepal Army with a few light helicopters useful for search and rescue after natural calamities.  \nIt has been over a month since the protests against Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli and the Nepali Congress Chairperson Sher Bahadur Deuba at Tundikhel, Kathmandu. Oli and Deuba were on a decorated stage to inaugurate the celebration of Gaura Parva and greet the assembled public. Gaura Parva is one of the biggest festivals in Western Nepal, celebrated annually to commemorate the marriage between Hindu goddess Gauri and lord Shiva. As Oli-Deuba lit candles to begin the programme, shouts of \"Oli Chor, Desh Chhod\" (Leave the country, Oli the thief) filled the air. The shouting continued when the duo, Oli first and then Deuba, delivered their greetings. A large group of young men in the audience led the protest. The protest leaders were arrested by the police the following day. Not long after, Man Bahadur Karki, a common citizen who sells mo:mo in Bouddha, was incarcerated for criticising the prime minister on his Facebook account. The slogans and shouting expressed outrage against politicians under whose watch Nepal's standing in the world has dropped to one of the poorest and most corrupt countries. Nepal's economy is in dire straits, public education is in shambles, and public institutions are dysfunctional. Thousands of despondent young men and women leave the country every year seeking work. The demonstration and the subsequent arrests sparked a heated debate in parliament. Many parliament members and media pundits saw in the protest the potential for a mass movement against the ruling politicians, akin to what transpired in Bangladesh. This possibility of a significant shift in Nepal's political landscape is both intriguing and engaging. What is the likelihood of a transformation in Nepal? Could removing the current brand of politicians pave the way for a new era of value-based governance and politics? Seeking answers, my mind wandered to my days in Iran in 1977-78 and Nepal just before the 1990 ‘jana andolan’. Iran 1977-79In late 1977, I worked on a vast pulp and paper factory construction project in Iran, a \"peaceful\" place. I enjoyed my work and the Iranians. But I wasn’t aware that the peace masked the undercurrent of simmering public anger against the Iranian King Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi's pro-American, \"anti-Islam\" policies and corruption in his government. The Shah's forces had, over the years, successfully crushed many sporadic anti-Shah protests led by the Imams and the banned pro-Soviet Tudeh party. Both Shah and the Americans saw these protests as minor irritants. There was a sense of entitlement and invincibility in Shah's government. In August 1978, a fire in a cinema hall in the province of Abadan killed nearly 400 people. Shah's opponents blamed the government for it. The government denied it, but no one believed them. People had lost trust in the state. A few months after the cinema fire, another anti-Shah protest erupted under the rallying cry of Ruhollah Khomeini, an Islamic cleric. Tudeh, a pro-Soviet party, joined forces with Khomeini. SAVAK, Shah's secret police, arrested and manhandled the protestors, further inflaming the conflict. Ordinary people started joining the protests. Mohammad Reza Shah fled the country in January 1979. ‘Jana andolan’ 1990For years, people's anger against the 30-year-old 'Partyless Panchayat System', a euphemism for King Mahendra's authoritarian rule, simmered under Kathmandu's peaceful veneer. The blatant abuse of power and corruption by those close to the palace alienated ordinary people from the royal regime. Sporadic protests against the government had happened before 1990, but the King's forces had crushed them. A sense of entitlement and invincibility prevailed among the Royals and their close associates.In early 1990, the Nepali Congress and Nepal's Communist parties joined forces and called for public protests, demanding the dismissal of the ban on political parties and the restoration of democracy. No one, including the leaders of the \"Movement for the Restoration of Democracy (MRD),\" seemed confident whether the movement would succeed.A couple of months before the MRD's scheduled start date, I asked Ganesh Man Singh, the movement's leader, to estimate the number of people who may join them. He said, \"Twenty thousand, thirty thousand.\" I asked if the movement would be successful. \"I do not know. We have to do what we have to do,\" he replied. Girija Prasad Koirala's answer was similar. Two days later, former Speaker of the House Daman Dhungana and I met Jaggananth Upadhya, Minister of Land Reform in BP Koirala's cabinet and a leader of the Nepali Congress, at his home in Thimi. His answer to my question was, \"I think in the beginning, about sixty thousand. But it will grow as the movement spreads.\"The MRD started on February 18, 1990. As the movement grew, the king's forces tried to crush the protestors violently. The state's violence gave unexpected momentum to the movement. People from all over the country started joining it. Finally, 49 days after the MRD began, the king buckled. On April 8, 1990, he lifted the ban on political parties. Will Nepal be a repeat of Bangladesh?Observations in Iran, Nepal and other countries, including countries impacted by the Arab Springs, point to a distinctive pattern that successful mass movements follow: Longest-serving politicians become numb to citizens' aspirations, develop a sense of entitlement and invincibility and lose people's trust; they successfully crush sporadic public uprisings against their abuses; suddenly, one day (no one knows when), the pent-up public discontent explodes; protests gain momentum; the government gets increasingly repressive; angered by the repression, the protesting mass grows beyond the government control, and the politicians give in or flee the country. In Nepal, hardly anyone trusts politicians; public anger against the leaders simmers. The supposedly democratic government is beginning to show signs of repression against the opposition, manifest in the arrest of Tundikhel protestors and those wearing tee shirts with the image of Balen Shah (Kathmandu's mayor, whom Oli dislikes) in Indra Jatra. Thus, the underlying conditions for an unexpected mass uprising are alive and present. Time will tell whether this will translate into a repeat of Bangladesh. The concern is that the \"repeat of Bangladesh\" may be a fitting punishment for politicians who have failed us, but it is unlikely to bring Nepal to the path of prosperity. Past uprisings, such as ‘jana andolan’, did not do it. In Iran, the Islamic government that followed the Shah has turned out to be worse than the Shah's. Arab Spring countries have similar experiences. The best alternative for Nepal is to replace the old politicians with competent people with a proven commitment to public service through the electoral process. \nOn Saturday, massive rains left at least 64 people dead and countless more injured. It uprooted people from their homes and left thousands without phone lines and electricity. Economic damages alone were estimated at between $95 billion and $100 billion. Local disaster responders said that given the scale of the event, some deaths and destruction were inevitable, even with the best of preparations. The trail of devastation that Hurricane Helene has left in its wake in the southeastern United States is the worst in decades. On the same day, halfway across the world in Nepal, incessant rains and floods and landslides killed at least 170, injured another 100, while 68 went missing. In Kathmandu Valley alone, 37 people perished in the heaviest rains the valley has seen in 54 years. Police personnel and rescue workers were digging up debris in multiple locations in the country, in the fear that more people might be buried. Both in the southeastern US seaboard and Nepal, Saturday’s water-induced disasters can be attributed to unpredictable weather. Yet, at least in Nepal’s case, climate change is only a part of a much larger story of neglect.Saturday’s tragedy in Nepal represents an egregious failure of the Nepali state to keep its citizens safe. Days in advance, the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology had been putting out reminders that the country was in for unprecedented rains. The message was endlessly broadcast through media platforms as well as each and every cell phone. Yet, when the tragedy struck, responsible government agencies seemed completely unprepared. Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak made a mockery of himself when he attributed the government’s failure to save four people who were stranded on their roof in Nakhu of Lalitpur to ‘poor visibility’ as a result of which choppers, supposedly, could not reach them. But then a good samaritan, Chaniklal Tamang, managed to rescue two of them by diving into the swollen Nakhu River. There could not be a better sign of the Nepali state’s incompetence. Not just incompetence though. The casual way high-ranking government officials like Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, Deputy Prime Minister Prakash Man Singh and Home Minister Lekhak have responded to queries over the government’s handling of the crisis shows an utter disregard for the lives of common folks. It was also galling that the police and army personnel deployed for rescue efforts, be it in Kathmandu or Dhading, reported having to work without basic equipment like raft jackets and rescue ropes. This suggests that even though water-induced disasters claim thousands of lives every year in Nepal, disaster preparedness and response have never been the state’s priority. It is easy to see why. Those in leadership positions in the government are too busy scheming to prolong their stay in power—when not working for various vested interests. Except during election time, seldom do they spend any time listening to people’s concerns. The country’s prime minister sending back from New York his smiling pictures with VVIPs while his country struggled with a national tragedy was not just a matter of poor optics and iffy judgment. In the eyes of the Nepali people, it was also an indication of his misplaced priorities. \nOne-way traffic resumed along the Daunne section of the East-West Highway at 8:30am on Tuesday after a landslide that obstructed the road on Monday night was cleared.Kamal Thapa, information officer at the Bardaghat Area Police Office, said small vehicles and motorcycles have begun using the route. However, authorities are facing difficulties in managing the long traffic congestion.The ongoing widening of the Narayanghat-Butwal road section continues to cause delays, with only 52.7 percent of work completed after six years and multiple deadline extensions. This has become a major concern during the Dashain travel rush. \n Mount Everest is Earth’s tallest mountain – towering 5.5 miles (8.85 km) above sea level – and is actually still growing.While it and the rest of the Himalayas are continuing an inexorable uplift that dates back to their birth roughly 50 million years ago when the Indian subcontinent collided with Eurasia, Everest is growing more than expected from this alone. Scientists now think they know the reason why, and it has to do with the monumental merger of two nearby river systems.Everest has gained roughly 49-164 feet (15-50 meters) in height due to this change in the regional river system, with the Kosi river merging with the Arun river approximately 89,000 years ago, the researchers estimated. That translates to an uplift rate of roughly 0.01-0.02 inches (0.2-0.5 millimeters) per year.The geological process at work, they said, is called isostatic rebound. It involves the rise of land masses on Earth’s crust when the weight of the surface diminishes. The crust, Earth’s outermost layer, essentially floats atop a mantle layer made of hot, semi-liquid rock.In this case, the merger of the rivers – more like a hostile takeover, with the Kosi subjugating the Arun as the rivers changed course over time – resulted in accelerated erosion that has carried off huge amounts of rock and soil, reducing the weight of the region near Everest.“Isostatic rebound can be likened to a floating object adjusting its position when weight is removed,” said geoscientist Jin-Gen Dai of China University of Geosciences in Beijing, one of the leaders of the study published on Monday in the journal *Nature Geoscience*.“When a heavy load, such as ice or eroded rock, is removed from the Earth’s crust, the land beneath slowly rises in response, much like a boat rising in water when cargo is unloaded,” Dai added.The main gorge of the merged river system is located approximately 28 miles (45 km) east of Everest.The researchers, who used numerical models to simulate the evolution of the river system, estimated that isostatic rebound accounts for about 10% of Everest’s annual uplift rate.This geological process is not unique to the Himalayas.“A classic example is in Scandinavia, where the land is still rising in response to the melting of thick ice sheets that covered the region during the last Ice Age. This process continues today, affecting coastlines and landscapes, thousands of years after the ice retreated,” Dai said.Study co-author Adam Smith, a University College London doctoral student in Earth sciences, said GPS measurements reveal the continued rising of Everest and the rest of the Himalayas.This uplift outpaces the continued surface erosion caused by factors such as wind, rain and river flow. As this erosion continues, Everest’s uplift rate from isostatic rebound may increase, Smith said.Neighbouring peaks including Lhotse, the world’s fourth highest, and Makalu, the fifth highest, also get a boost from the same process. Lhotse is experiencing an uplift rate similar to Everest. Makalu, situated closer to the Arun, has a slightly higher uplift rate.“This research underscores our planet’s dynamic nature. Even a seemingly immutable feature like Mount Everest is subject to ongoing geological processes, reminding us that Earth is constantly changing, often in ways imperceptible in our daily lives,” Dai said.Earth’s rigid outer part is divided into colossal plates that move gradually over time in a process called plate tectonics, with the Himalayas rising following a collision between two plates.Everest, also called Sagarmatha in Nepali and Chomolungma in Tibetan, is situated on the border between Nepal and the Tibet Autonomous Region of China. It was named for George Everest, a 19th century British surveyor in India.“Mount Everest occupies a unique place in human consciousness,” Dai said.“Physically, it represents Earth’s highest point, giving it immense significance simply by virtue of its stature,” Dai added. “Culturally, Everest is sacred to local Sherpa and Tibetan communities. Globally, it symbolizes the ultimate challenge, embodying human endurance and our drive to surpass perceived limits.” \n Israel’s widely expected ground invasion of Lebanon appeared to be getting underway early on Tuesday as its military said troops had begun “limited” raids against Hezbollah targets in the border area.The military said in a statement that it had begun “limited, localised, and targeted ground raids based on precise intelligence” against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon villages close to the border that posed “an immediate threat to Israeli communities in northern Israel”.It said the air force and artillery were supporting the ground forces with “precise strikes.”Local residents in the Lebanese border town of Aita al-Shaab reported heavy shelling and the sound of helicopters and drones overhead. Flares were repeatedly launched over the Lebanese border town of Rmeish, lighting up the night sky.On Monday, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant had told local council heads in northern Israel that the next phase of the war along Lebanon’s southern border would begin soon, and would support the aim of bringing home Israelis who have fled Hezbollah rockets during nearly a year of border warfare.The ground invasion represents an escalating conflict in the Middle East between Israel and Iran-backed militants, sparked by an assault on Israel by Palestinian militant group Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023, that now threatens to suck in the US and Iran.An Israeli strike in Lebanon early on Tuesday targeted Mounir Maqdah, commander of the Lebanese branch of the Palestinian Fatah movement’s military wing, the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, according to two Palestinian security officials.His fate was unknown.The strike hit a building in the crowded Ain al-Hilweh Palestinian refugee camp near the southern city of Sidon, the sources said. It marked the first strike on the camp, Lebanon’s largest Palestinian camp, since cross-border hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel broke out nearly a year ago.In Syria, three civilians were killed and nine others injured in an Israeli airstrike on the capital Damascus, Syrian state media said on Tuesday citing a military source. Israel’s military said it does not comment on foreign media reports.Israel has been carrying out strikes against Iran-linked targets in Syria for years but has ramped up raids since the Hamas attack on Israel’s southern territory on Oct. 7, 2023.Hamas killed 1,200 people and took about 250 hostage in its assault on Israel, according to Israeli tallies. Israel in response launched a massive assault on Hamas in Gaza, reducing most of the Palestinian territory to rubble, displacing most of its 2.3 million people and killing more than 41,300 Palestinians, according to the Gaza health ministry.STRIKES ON BEIRUTIsrael’s ground invasion into Lebanon follows its deadly detonation of booby-trapped Hezbollah pagers, two weeks of airstrikes, and its killing on Friday of Hezbollah head Hassan Nasrallah, which dealt the group one of the heaviest blows in decades.The intensive air strikes have eliminated several Hezbollah commanders but also killed about 1,000 civilians and forced one million to flee their homes, according to the Lebanese government.Overnight, strikes hit Beirut’s southern suburbs, a security source said. A Reuters reporter witnessed a flash of light and a series of loud blasts about an hour after the Israeli military warned residents to evacuate areas near buildings it said contained Hezbollah infrastructure south of the Lebanese capital.In the past 24 hours, at least 95 people had been killed and 172 wounded in Israeli strikes on Lebanon’s southern regions, the eastern Bekaa Valley, and Beirut, Lebanon’s health ministry said early on Tuesday.Hezbollah’s deputy leader Naim Qassem, in a first public speech on Monday since Nasrallah’s death, said that “the resistance forces are ready for a ground engagement.”He said Hezbollah had continued to fire rockets as deep as 150 km (93 miles) into Israeli territory.“We know that the battle may be long. We will win as we won in the liberation of 2006,” he said, referring to the last big conflict between the two foes.Late on Monday, Lebanese troops pulled back about five kilometres (3 miles) from positions along Lebanon’s southern border with Israel, a Lebanese security source told Reuters. A Lebanese army spokesperson did not confirm or deny the movement.Lebanon’s army has historically stayed on the sidelines of major conflicts with Israel, and in the last year of hostilities has not fired on the Israeli military.The White House and the US State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Israel’s ground operations in Lebanon.But on Monday, US President Joe Biden had called for a ceasefire.“I’m more worried than you might know and I’m comfortable with them stopping,” Biden told reporters when asked if he was comfortable with Israeli plans for a cross-border incursion. “We should have a ceasefire now.”Israel last week rejected a proposal by the US and France calling for a 21-day ceasefire on the Lebanon border to give time for a diplomatic settlement that would allow displaced civilians on both sides to return home. \nThere is a saying that social service professionals tackling family violence are familiar with: If you don’t break out of the cycle of violence, the cycle will break you.I learnt this from Ms Lorraine Lim, deputy chief executive of the Singapore Council of Women’s Organisations (SCWO), who explained that the cycle of violence describes the phases in an abusive relationship.For example, there is the honeymoon phase after the incidence of violence when the abusive husband may shower his wife with greater affection and promise never to use force again.Thinking the worst is over, the woman goes on with life – until the man flares up again, and the cycle repeats. Ms Lim said: “Studies have shown that if you don’t break this cycle of violence, it will escalate.”Helping victims of domestic abuse break out of the cycle of violence is a major challenge, and perhaps the biggest hurdle is getting them to report the abuse in the first place.Like other social workers interviewed, Ms Lim said family violence cases tend to be under-reported. The shame of being abused and the fear that reporting violence will sever the relationship or get a loved one in trouble with the law are among the reasons why victims stay silent.At the SCWO’s Star Shelter for women and children who are survivors of family violence, many women had endured the abuse for an average of between four and seven years before they sought help, she said.A parliamentary reply in 2023 laid bare just how hard it is for an abused child, or the child’s family members, to report a loved one who hurt the child to the authorities.Of the cases that the Ministry of Social and Family Development’s (MSF) Child Protective Service (CPS) investigates, abused children who directly reported the matter to the CPS form less than 0.5 per cent, while those reported by family members of the abused child make up less than 1.5 per cent of the cases probed.Instead, over 95 per cent of reports were made by community groups such as pre-schools, schools, healthcare facilities, the police and social service agencies.In another parliamentary reply in 2023, it was revealed that about 90 per cent of child abuse cases investigated by the CPS were committed by parents or caregivers.On Sept 26, MSF released the first Domestic Violence Trends report, which contains data on child, elder and spousal abuse.It showed that there were 2,008 new spousal violence cases in 2023, up by 15 per cent from 1,741 such cases in 2022. In 2021, the figure was 1,632.The number of new Tier 1 child abuse cases, defined as those with low to moderate safety and risk concerns, rose 17 per cent from 2,377 cases in 2021 to 2,787 cases in 2023. There were 2,760 such cases in 2022.Greater awareness and better detectionThis rise in lower-risk child abuse and spousal violence cases may actually be a positive development. Social service professionals who work with victims of family violence cite two factors that have contributed to the growing numbers.First, there is more awareness of family violence and a greater willingness to report the abuse.Not only are more victims and their loved ones seeking help to stop the violence, some abusers are also realising they need help, social workers say.Ms Joyz Tan, director of Fei Yue Family Service Centre, said it is seeing some individuals seek help to manage their anger issues after realising their behaviour is considered abusive.Beyond physical violence, the public is also now more aware about emotional and psychological abuse too, she said.This is a good sign. The violence that takes place behind closed doors cannot be addressed if no one speaks out or seeks help. Social workers note that if the abuse is not addressed, it tends to worsen over time.Second, more people have been trained to spot and report the abuse. More than 9,300 people in various sectors, such as childcare staff and school teachers, have so far been trained to spot and report signs of family violence, the MSF said. Certain groups, such as social service professionals, get more in-depth training in this area, social workers say.Training professionals and people in the community to spot and report the abuse is critical because many victims stay mum about the abuse, or may not know what to do or who to turn to for help. Ms Han Yah Yee, acting chief executive of Montfort Care, said: “The increase in Tier 1 (child abuse) cases may not be a bad thing as it’s better for cases to be reported early before it escalates to become Tier 2 cases.”Tier 2 abuse cases are high-risk cases that may warrant removing the child from the family to keep him safe. They are managed by the MSF’s Child Protective Service, while Tier 1 cases are managed by community agencies such as Child Protection Specialist Centres. The number of new Tier 2 child abuse cases fell slightly from 2,141 cases in 2021 to 2,011 cases in 2023. Early detection and intervention by community agencies would have prevented cases from escalating in risk, said the MSF spokeswoman.From what social workers say, the child protection ecosystem is now better organised and better equipped to detect and manage child abuse cases. Hence, it is perhaps not surprising that more cases are detected.More reported cases may not mean more people being abusedThe rise in the number of new Tier 1 child abuse cases may not mean there are actually many more children being abused. What it could mean is that cases which could have previously gone unreported are coming to light now.The Government’s focus on family violence and the resources pumped into tackling this scourge have made a significant difference, social workers say.They point to the work of the Task Force on Family Violence set up in 2020, which made 16 recommendations that are being progressively implemented.These recommendations are in four areas: increasing awareness of family violence, making it easier to report the violence and get immediate help, boosting protection and support for victims, and taking a stronger enforcement approach and beefing up rehabilitation for perpetrators.The task force is chaired by Minister of State for Social and Family Development Sun Xueling and Minister of State for Home Affairs Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim.For example, it is easy to report abuse by calling the National Anti-Violence and Sexual Harassment Helpline, launched in 2021. The public can also make an online report.In 2023, the Domestic Violence Emergency Response Team (Dvert) was launched. The team, comprising social service professionals, responds to high-risk domestic violence cases with the police 24/7.Mr Martin Chok, deputy director of family and community services at Care Corner Singapore, said Dvert officers are trained to assess the situation and refer victims to help services or a crisis shelter on the spot.He said: “Without Dvert, the police may refer the case to us, but it may take a few days.”Time is of the essence if it is a high-risk case to keep the victim safe, he said.He added that the victim may change his or her mind about seeking help after a few days, when the act of violence has passed and life goes back to normal. The Women’s Charter was also amended in 2023 to boost protection for victims of family violence and to boost rehabilitation and accountability for perpetrators.These measures have a cumulative impact, which will have a deterrent effect on abusers and also encourage more victims to speak out and seek help.The message is clear: Domestic violence will not be condoned.And there is help for both the abused and the abuser to stop the violence.It all starts by breaking the silence.The Straits Times/ANN \nNepali leaders have congratulated Chinese President Xi Jinping and the people of China on China’s 75th founding anniversary.Former Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba conveyed his best wishes, stating, “Warm congratulations to President Xi Jinping and the people of China on the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China.”“Wishing continued peace, prosperity, and success. Nepal cherishes its strong friendship and looks forward to deepening our cooperation.”Similarly, former Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal expressed his congratulations: “On the auspicious occasion of the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, I extend my heartfelt congratulations and best wishes to His Excellency President Xi Jinping, the Communist Party of China, the government, and the friendly people of China.”The 75th founding anniversary marks the establishment of the People’s Republic of China on October 1, 1949. On this historic day, Mao Zedong, then chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, proclaimed the PRC’s founding at Tiananmen Square in Beijing. \nThe weather will be partly to generally cloudy in Koshi Province and Madhesh Province along with the hilly regions of rest of the country and partly cloudy to mainly fair in rest of the country on Tuesday. According to the Metrological Forecasting Division, light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is likely to occur at a few places of Koshi Province and Gandaki Province and at one or two places of Madhesh Province and Bagmati Province.Tonight, it will be partly to generally cloudy in Koshi Province, Bagmati Province and Gandaki Province along with the hilly regions of rest of the country and Partly cloudy to mainly fair in rest of the country. Light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is likely to occur at some places of Koshi Province and at a few places of the hilly region of Bagmati Province and Gandaki Province and at one or two places of hilly region of rest of the country.There is an impact of monsoon winds across the country. Nepal is experiencing a partial effect of a low-pressure system situated around Madhya Pradesh, India.On Monday, the maximum temperature was recorded at 36.4°C in Janakpur, while the lowest minimum was 9.5°C in Jomsom, with Taplejung receiving the highest rainfall of 9.5 mm in the last 24 hours. \nThe government has declared a three-day mourning after floods and landslides killed at least 209 people across the country. A Cabinet meeting on Monday evening held after Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli returned from the United States of America decided to honour the victims.Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak informed the meeting that at least 209 people have died in recent disasters, while search, rescue, rehabilitation and treatment efforts for the injured were ongoing.According to one minister, the government has pledged Rs 1 billion to the Prime Minister Disaster Relief Fund.Prime Minister Oli has instructed ministers to submit a detailed report on the loss of lives and properties by Tuesday and cost estimates for rebuilding, said the minister.The national flag will be flown at half-mast during the three days of mourning, said Minister for Communication and Information Technology Prithvi Subba Gurung, who is also the government spokesperson.Also, the meeting has decided to hand over Rs200,000 to the families of those who died in the floods and landslides. If someone has gone missing and his/her body is not found within ten days, the person will be considered as dead and the family will receive the same compensation as other victims.The government has announced free treatment for all those injured in the disaster. As many as 92 people are currently receiving treatment in various hospitals, according to the home ministry.Similarly, all ministers will contribute one month’s salary to the Prime Minister Disaster Relief Fund. The meeting also discussed restoring double lane traffic in all major highways, and curbing black marketing during the festive season.  \nThe Nepal Oil Corporation (NOC) has reduced the prices of petrol, diesel, and kerosene, with effect from Monday midnight.Under Nepal's automatic fuel pricing mechanism, the corporation adjusts prices based on the tariff received from its sole supplier, Indian Oil Corporation.A NOC board meeting decided to lower the price of petrol by Re1 per litre and diesel and kerosene by Rs2 a litre. Additionally, the price of domestic aviation fuel has been reduced by Rs6 per litre, while international aviation fuel has been cut by 45 US dollars per kilolitre.Consumers will now pay Rs158 per litre for petrol and Rs147 per litre for diesel and kerosene in Kathmandu, Pokhara, and Dipayal.In Surkhet and Dang, petrol will cost Rs157 per litre, and diesel and kerosene will be priced at Rs146 per litre. In Charaali, Biratnagar, Janakpur, Amlekhgunj, Bhalwari, Nepalgunj, Dhangadhi, and Birgunj, petrol will be priced at Rs155.50 per litre, and diesel and kerosene at Rs144.50 per litre.The corporation has announced that the prices of cooking gas cylinders will remain unchanged, despite incurring a loss of Rs269.80 per cylinder due to the revised price from IOC. \nThe death toll from the rain-triggered floods and landslides has risen to 200. The disaster, since Thursday, has devastated various parts of the country, leading to widespread destruction.According to the latest update issued at 3:30 pm on Monday by Nepal Police, 26 people are still missing while rescue operations have saved 4,222 individuals. At least 127 people have been injured in the affected areas. Rescue and relief efforts by teams from the Nepal Police, Armed Police Force, and Nepali Army are ongoing, the police said.Infrastructure damage has been extensive, with many roads blocked by landslides and floods, severely hampering transportation and rescue efforts.In a public notice issued on Monday, the police advised the public to contact local police stations before embarking on long journeys to check for potential road closures.Urging people in high-risk areas to stay alert, the police requested the public to contact the Police Control Room at 100 or the Central Police Operations Desk at 9851285635 for updates. \nThe death toll from the rain-triggered floods and landslides mainly in the central and eastern parts of Nepal has now reached 209, according to the latest figures released by the Ministry of Home Affairs on Monday evening. The disaster, which began on Thursday, continued to cause widespread destruction in multiple provinces until Sunday, leaving thousands displaced.According to the ministry at least 29 people still remain missing, while rescue teams have managed to save 4,222 individuals from the disaster-hit areas. The number of injured has also risen to 142 as rescue and relief efforts continue.The Nepal Police, Armed Police Force, and Nepali Army are working together in the ongoing rescue operations. However, efforts have been significantly hampered by damaged infrastructure, with key roads blocked due to landslides and flooding, complicating the transportation of essential supplies and aid.In an advisory issued on Monday, Nepal Police urged the public to stay vigilant, especially those residing in high-risk areas. They recommended checking with local police stations for updates on road conditions before undertaking long journeys, as many routes remain dangerous or impassable. \nAs the festive season approaches, prices of daily essentials like rice, edible oil, legumes, and lentils have increased.Retailers say food prices are expected to stay high throughout Dashain and Tihar, Nepal’s biggest festivals.In Nepal, food prices are heavily influenced by the Indian market. Even though prices have not increased in India, some opportunist traders have been taking advantage of the poor market monitoring to increase prices under different pretexts. For example, on September 14, India raised the basic import tax on crude and refined edible oils by 20 percent. Nepali importers seized this opportunity to hike their prices even though Nepal had not raised the import tax.Dhurba Prasad Adhikari, joint treasurer of the Nepal Retailers Association, said Nepali wholesalers and retailers have already raised the prices. “It has been a week since edible oil price was increased by Rs20 per litre and the price is expected to increase further as the festive demand kicks in,” he said. But he admits that market rumours and weak inspections make prices more unstable, especially during the festive season when demand is at its peak.According to the association, sunflower oil prices have increased from Rs190 to Rs210 per litre. Likewise, the per litre price of mustard oil has gone up from Rs350 to Rs370.Adhikari, who operates Adhikari Khadya Store, said the price of edible oil is expected to increase in Tihar due to high demand.Retailers said strict inspections in large trading houses could help stabilise prices during the festive season. Consumer rights activists say the current government inspections of the market are just for show and will not address issues related to price, quality, and quantity.“The government’s market inspection body is looking only at retail markets. They, too, know this will not change prices unless they also inspect the warehouses of large importers and traders,” Adhikari said. He said that the government inspecting body needs to check on the stock of goods held by traders.According to retailers, even with the new rice harvesting beginning soon, prices of the staple have increased by Rs100 kg for a 25 kg bag.Even the price of sona mansuli, which normally remains at Rs60 per kg, has now inched up to Rs70 to Rs75 per kg.Rice prices, however, are expected to decline after the arrival of the new harvest.Sugar is now being sold at Rs120 per kg and expected to rise further, retailers said.As private sector traders say they are out of sugar stock and both state supply utilities—the Salt Trading Corporation and the Food Management and Trading Company—have delayed opening the tender to import the sweetener, according to market insiders, the price is expected to cross Rs160 per kg by Tihar.However, retailers said the jeera (cumin seed) price has declined. But the price could still go up in the next two weeks.Last year during Dashain, the price of jeera, an indispensable spice, spiked from Rs1,400 to Rs1,500 per kg. The price has declined, and it is being transacted around Rs950 per kg this year, Adhikari said. Prices of lentils and legumes tend to fluctuate based on international production, but have remained high in recent months.According to the association, pulses have reached Rs180 per kg from Rs175 per kg.Adhikari said food prices have been increasing every year. “The rice prices are so high that people are buying only what they need in smaller quantities,” said Adhikari.“The government needs to intervene in the market, particularly inspect the large traders engaged in unscrupulous market activities,” said Prem Lal Maharjan, president of the National Consumer Forum. “Proper inspection will help bring the prices down. It will also help the government bring in more revenues,” he said.As the government has started operating fair-price shops across the country, there might be some relief for consumers, Maharjan said. “But such subsidised shops should be operated year-round to control market prices.”    \nDean Richard Thompson recently completed his two years as the American ambassador to Nepal. Arriving here just before the 2022 elections, he has since closely observed Nepali politics and society. Umesh Chauhan and Biswas Baral recently sat down with Thompson to reflect on his time in Nepal, major US projects in the country including those under the MCC, geopolitical competition with China, trade, and a range of other issues.How have you seen Nepali politics evolve in the two years you have been in the country? What events stood out? I’ve seen a lot of Nepali politics. Obviously, there’s been a lot of changes. I got here right before the national elections in November 2022. It was really great to see the democratic process play out here, to see Nepalis turn out in such great numbers and make their choices known.Democracy is such a vibrant and colourful exercise anywhere in the world. Nepal did not disappoint on that front. It's been fascinating to watch it evolve, to watch the governments come in different formations.What’s been great is the commitment we’ve seen from successive groups in government to moving forward and carrying forward the [bilateral] partnership and building on projects. I’ve also been amazed at some of the innovative things happening in various sectors of the economy.There has been some very exciting work in the IT sector, for example, that runs the gamut from more traditional back-office type operations to cutting-edge AI research, to developing educational apps for school students, to things like what we have been sponsoring at our Content Creator’s Mela these past two years. It is great to see Nepalis show lots of creativity in expressing themselves and talking about their culture and their society in so many different ways. Across the board, I’d say the experience has been unique.How have the Nepal-US relations evolved over the past 77 years of diplomatic ties? What are the salient features of the relationship? What I would say is we’ve always tried to listen, to engage with the Nepali society. Based on that, I think one of the things that we’ve done is refine the range of products.The Peace Corps, the USAID, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, the Development Finance Corporation, or other elements of our assistance and development commitments—these are different tools that can be employed. And Nepal has continually expanded its capacity to take advantage of them. The US has been able to increase the number of tools and assets, if you will, that Nepal can use to build its economy.I’m very proud of the fact that we have done this primarily through grant-based assistance, so that there is little in terms of downsides. At the same time, we have focused on different segments of the economy or society, for example, through the Development Finance Corporation, we’re now able to target and work with the financial sector to create more opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises, particularly women-run enterprises. Through the USAID, we can use more of the traditional mechanisms of assistance.The Millennium Challenge Corporation kind of speaks for itself. It targets large-scale, massive infrastructure type projects that aim to be transformative in terms of Nepal’s economy. It has helped grow the road and infrastructure network and show new technology that can help expand that network and make roads safer, more reliable, and easier to maintain. It has helped build an electricity infrastructure that allows Nepal, first and foremost, to internally use the green hydropower that's at its disposal, but there will be excess capacity even to export it to the region to earn additional income. So I’m pretty excited about what I’ve seen happen over the past 77 years, and where we are today. I’m also extremely positive about building on where we are now. Can you give us a status of the implementation of projects under the Millennium Challenge Account Nepal? In the MCC, energy, obviously, is a high-priority area and so is transportation. Where we are with the projects themselves is we have let out the contracts for the sub-stations, for the 18-kilometre cross-border transmission line, and we have reissued the tender for the 297-kilometre broader transmission line package that had to be revised due to some cost changes over the time it took to implement that piece of the package.But we’re pretty positive about getting that back on track by the end of the year and putting the project firmly on the right footing for a five-year completion timeline. But there have also been hurdles, right? Do you still expect the transmission lines and road projects to be completed in five years?I expect there to be more hurdles. The biggest challenge was when the bids came back for the 297-kilometre transmission line. We had a number of delays there from Covid to worldwide inflation, to supply chain shifts that I don’t think people had foreseen completely. I’m not surprised. But the MCC has had a lot of experience around the world with these projects.It builds into this assumption that there will be challenges, there will be situations that need to be rethought and overcome. The real trick is making sure we move forward in a way that’s smart and focused on keeping things on time and on track. We're fortunate in the case of Nepal because we have a partner that has so heavily invested its own resources into the project.We have our $500 million grant and Nepal is putting in almost $200 million. It’s been made a national pride project. Look, other things will inevitably come up. But we believe that we have a good team that’s ready to tackle those types of challenges and press forward.At the end of the day, this can serve as a really positive model for how development assistance and how large-scale infrastructure projects can be implemented in a partnership that is largely the result of an internal domestic process. Don’t forget, Nepal requested the MCC project. The government of Nepal, through a consultative process, developed the idea, designed the project, and is now its lead implementer.We’re a financier and a partner but it is very much a Nepal-owned effort. Talking about challenges, there are many local governments and we have to deal with them every 10 to 15 kilometres in the project areas. Different communities have different concerns and priorities. This can add to some difficulty.What do you think will happen to the project if it cannot meet the five-year deadline?The fate of the project is to be completed in its entirety in five years. I can't speak to whether there’s going to be a particular challenge to delay it by six months or seven months or something like that. Right now, in our planning and projection, we hope that we can move it forward within the timeline.If it needs to go beyond that, we’ll work closely with our partner and figure it out. I’m confident that the $500 million that the US government is providing will be spent within the five years and it will lay a firm foundation for the completion of the project.But coming back to your scenario, indeed, you have different communities. A lot of people are affected by this. Now, on the one hand, that's why we encourage and insist on a consultative process, on everything being as transparent as possible so people know exactly what’s going to happen, that they know what the money is being spent on, what the effects will be in terms of how many trees will have to be cut down or what roads will be built where. That’s very important to us: no surprises for the communities that are out there.I think that we will rely on a lot of that effort to help us propel the project forward if things do get challenging on other fronts as well.Like you said, the project does need to be completed by a deadline of five years. Just in case it doesn’t, what happens?Look, it is an ambitious undertaking. There’s no question about it, right? And the Millennium Challenge Corporation is committed to making it happen within that five-year period. The MCA Nepal is committed to making it happen within that five-year period. But they’re also working closely together to make sure that it’s being done in a proper way, in a transparent way, and I’m confident that we will be able to complete what we need to complete. I’m also sure there’s a firm commitment from the government that if there’s a little piece left over here or there, to make sure it goes forward.I don’t worry about the ultimate completion of the project. I’m more focused on how we get it going as quickly as possible, because just the implementation of the project itself should employ close to 10,000 Nepalis, right? I really want communities to start to see the benefit of the project as soon as possible, because that’s where the transformative nature of it comes into play. Part of it is building it. Part of it is implementing it. Part of it is learning from that process. But then having this infrastructure in place, that’s what really changes the dynamic in Nepal and in the economic well-being of the country.Some fear that a failure to complete the project on time could even create rifts in our bilateral ties.I don’t think they should be fearful. We are partners in this, and if there’s any issue, if we're going to work through it together. What we should be doing is focusing entirely on implementing the project to its fullest potential as quickly as possible.Let’s move to geopolitics. What we see in the region is seemingly an exclusivist India-China geopolitical competition. Indians appear reluctant to work with the regimes that work closely with China. It's almost like they are saying, it's either the Chinese or us. How do you see this geopolitical dynamics playing out in Nepal? And where do the Americans fit in this picture?Yeah, it’s a good question in terms of the dynamic that’s in play today and where things are headed. We have of course been watching the India-China relationship and its development over the past few years with some degree of concern. Obviously, there was conflict there some years ago, and I think they’ve been trying to manage that since.And there’s no question that other countries in the region feel that very powerfully. From our standpoint, what we would like to see is the countries of the region—and particularly Nepal because that’s where I’m accredited and that’s where I have some level of knowledge—exercise their sovereignty and to have the space that they need to make decisions about they own future on behalf of their people in a positive way.We don’t believe countries should be asked to choose. We fully expect that Nepal is going to have good relations with India and China. They’re two neighbours. They’re large countries. They’re important countries in the region. It’s critically important for Nepal that it works with and benefits from both India and China.At the same time, we see no reason that should have any effect on our relationship with Nepal, and no reason Nepal should not be fully able to take full advantage of what the US has to offer. We will continue to watch and continue to work closely with Nepal as a partner and to encourage it to exercise its sovereignty and its decision-making in a way that benefits the Nepali people. The US-China relations are also very dicey at the moment. Surely this has some effect on how the US perceives the Chinese role around the world, including in Nepal.We had a recent high-level visit by our National Security Advisor [to China]. We’ve had recent visits by the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Treasury. I think there’s a real effort to try to manage what we all acknowledge is as a competition that’s underway, in a way that’s positive and can maybe move us more towards some type of cooperative element.That channel should continue to be pursued by the US and China, but it’s not reflective of our relationship with Nepal, or our relationship with India. This is about what we can do together [with Nepal]. I’m not going to comment on what other countries may be saying about us, how they may be trying to influence us.I would commit to us remaining as transparent as possible so Nepalis can make their own decisions about what's happening by our relationship.Recently, the Americans were blamed for ousting Sheikh Hasina from Bangladesh. The US is also often accused of meddling in the domestic affairs of other South Asian states, and in other parts of the world for that matter. How do you respond to this accusation?First off, I think you’ve got to take with a grain of salt anything that’s being said by someone who’s been forced to flee their country. The United States simply does not meddle in the internal politics of other countries. We work very hard to be as transparent as we possibly can about our relationships, about what we’re doing, about what we intend.That’s not to say that if we disagree vehemently with a country about a certain policy or a certain issue, we won’t raise it. But this idea that the US would find some benefit in enacting a change in government like that, it simply isn’t part of our repertoire of diplomacy. What we rather look to do is build the strongest relationships that we can.We love to do that primarily through people-to-people relationships and sponsoring as much development opportunity as we possibly can with our partner countries. So, I put no stock in these types of rumours and statements.There is also this sentiment that the Americans and the Indians are increasingly working together on strategic issues, and the same is seen even in South Asia.Certainly, there’s been a huge growth in the strategic partnership between the US and India. I think we want to see that continue to move forward in a positive way. At the same time, there have been disagreements between the US and India on various fronts, just as we have disagreements with many of our partners. And we try to deal with those in a proactive, professional and productive way.But, again, we see our relationship with each individual country through a bilateral lens. So if there are ways that the US and India working together can be beneficial, and another country agrees to such a cooperation, fine. But when it comes to Nepal, we’re going to base our relationship and our efforts first and foremost on our bilateral discussions and our bilateral relationship.Even as we speak, the US and Nepali armies are undertaking joint training in Nepal. How would you characterise the relations between the two armies?Yeah, the PAC ANGEL exercise is going on, focused on disaster relief, humanitarian assistance. The relationship between the two militaries has been strong, it remains strong, and I think it will continue to be strong primarily because we focus it on the areas Nepal wants to focus on—which is building a Nepal army that is capable of responding to disasters, providing humanitarian assistance, and then serving as part of the global peacekeeping network through the United Nations as the largest contributor force of peacekeepers. It’s in our interest to see Nepal continue to professionalise and develop its capacity on those fronts. That’s where our focus is, and that’s where we will continue to make efforts.There has also been a lot of debate in Nepal on the Indo-Pacific Strategy (IPS) and its applicability to South Asia. What is the current state of its application?The Indo-Pacific Strategy is a broad, big strategy by the United States government about how it looks at the entire region. And so it’s about how we create an open, independent, sovereign Indo-Pacific region for the benefit of all the people in the region.What we will continue to do is employ it to build relationships we have with each of the countries in the region. How can we continue to support democratic development? How can we continue to support economic development? Let’s not forget a huge portion, maybe 60 percent of the world’s commerce transits the Indo-Pacific corridor in some way, shape, or form every year.It’s in everyone’s interest for that to remain open and free. And for the countries of the region to be able to act in a sovereign way in their own interests.There is also a sizable section of Nepalis who believe that the IPS was brought with the intent of countering China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), and that Nepal is struggling to find a balance between the two. What is your reading?The USAID, the MCC, the Development Finance Corporation, all of our development programmes have a singular purpose, which is to work with our bilateral partners to grow their economies, to make them more able to meet the needs of their people. That’s the goal. That's how they were designed. And that’s how we will continue to treat them.The BRI is China's initiative. It’s pushing that forward. It’s up to each country to decide how it wants to engage with others. We believe the model of, say, a USAID or an MCC is proving itself to be beneficial to countries, as they are grant-based and economic growth oriented. We’ll continue to push them because we think the data and historical experience we’ve had support them.I think it’s incumbent on us to try to help all of our partners relate to us as equals in any realm that we’re working together. That’s critically important and something we have to acknowledge and something we have to make sure that they’re able to acknowledge.It's about building trust, about showing that our intent is correct, that we have the best interest of our partners in mind, and that we’re applying the same and transparent standards universally.For example, on the MCC, we’ve published everything on the internet. If anybody in Nepal has a question about any aspect of the project, they can go to the website, they can read about the project, they can see the blueprints, they can know exactly what it’s going to involve. That's how I think we build relationships.I think if I came to Nepal and said, hey, I want to do X project because I want to counter this country, I don’t think I would get very good reception. We just don’t look at the world that way. It’s not a healthy approach in the long run.But a bilateral focus that seeks to empower the people of a country—that’s where I think we have the best chance of moving forward. Nepal’s Parliament has finally passed an amendment to the transitional justice law. How does the US see this development? How do you see the transitional justice process progressing?I think this is a really important step in the process. I would say that we remain positive about the way it's going and we are looking to see how we can help. You noted, I’m sure, that we joined a number of other partner countries in issuing a statement of support after the Parliament passed it.We all know bringing a conflict of this scale to conclusion is always going to be a challenge. The TJ legislation has passed, which was a tough hurdle, but implementation will also be difficult.We’re looking forward to figuring out how we can be supportive, and how other partners can be supportive. Some of that may be through bilateral means. Some of it may be through multilateral means.But what I remain encouraged about, in particular, is, we’ve always said this needs to be a Nepali-run process. It has been. That it needs to be victim-centric. I believe that it is. And so we need to make sure the consultative piece of this remains alive as you move to implementation, so that the victims groups, so that the child soldier groups, so that other entities that have been involved continue to have a voice and continue to work together to figure out how to resolve this, to make reparations work, to bring justice in those cases. And so, we are positive.Thousands of Nepali youths are leaving the country every single day in search of better jobs. In this light, do you see the prospect of greater American FDI helping Nepal build a more robust economy that can create enough good jobs?I do. At the beginning of the interview, I talked about some sectors of the economy that are quite exciting right now. I think you’re seeing a lot of interest from the US in the IT sector, the tourism sector, in the health sector, and in the energy sector as it continues to develop.We’re very keen to look for ways to bring more US investment here, whether it’s through equity sort of vehicles, or direct bilateral investments. I think that can also be positive. I think Nepal did a good job in setting up that April Investment Summit. That sent a really positive signal. You’ll recall that we had a representative from the US Chamber of Commerce, Atul Keshap, come out for that. We’ve had a great run of senior US visitors out here over the last year and a half.I think the key right now is for Nepal, through its private sector, through its government, to figure out how to make the environment for investment in Nepal as attractive as it can possibly be. In this interview, we’ve talked about the idea of competition between countries. One place where I will absolutely acknowledge there’s competition is in trying to attract investment.And so Nepal needs to figure out how to make itself as attractive as possible, and how to make it as easy as possible to do business. That helps not only investments that come from other countries, but makes it easier for Nepalis to start businesses, right? It makes it easier for Nepalis to operate and do what they want. And so, in addition to welcoming, say, US companies or British companies or Canadian companies, we would also love to see Nepalis who have gone abroad come back and start to help in building the economy here.We’ve seen how capable and how dynamic they are in building other people’s economies. Let’s do the same here at home.I mentioned that the trade and investment framework talks that we have with Nepal are in their seventh round. I look forward to, in the rest of my tenure here, to continue to build the momentum that will allow investment to take shape and the economy here to thrive. \nHere’s what Prime Minister KP Oli told the parliament on Monday, saying he was giving the address for a “special” reason: “Nepal wants to maintain neighbourly relations as a good neighbour, not a petty, scheming neighbour…Nepal wants a similar behaviour on the part of its neighbours.”He pursued this line of argument, implying that India is wishing ill on Nepal, imposing on Nepal’s sovereignty and interfering in its independent status and policy. He then told the parliament that he would present the issue at the United Nations General Assembly.It basically amounts to saying he will complain to the UN about India’s behaviour. What a petty idea.Given his inherent character trait, PM Oli will find it difficult to develop trusted relations with India in the short term. His only option is to be diplomatic, predictable and consistent. So far, he’s not been able to do that. It does not bode well for Nepal’s foreign policy, which is the most important means of pursuing Nepal’s current priorities, including jobs, growth and climate change.Calculated relations Oli’s statement in the parliament indicates at least three things. First, his expectations from India have not been fulfilled. Second, his communications with the country have broken down. And third, he thinks India may be working to undermine his political authority.Let’s look at his expectations from the southern neighbour. Oli wants to hold high-level talks with PM Modi of India and build trusted relations.In the past two weeks, media reports and opinion pieces have discussed whether Oli would be invited to India or not. It has almost become customary in Nepal for a new prime minister to visit India first before embarking on other high-level visits. Such a custom indicates the value politicians accord to India, especially if they want their government to be stable.The second indication is that Oli is finding it difficult to communicate with people who matter in India. When you begin to communicate your feelings about India through the media, it indicates that your direct communications have either broken down or are ineffective.Behind Oli’s statement is an obvious intention to play the blame game or rally the public. India may be at fault for many things, but blaming India does not absolve him of inconsistencies on his part or the sheer inability to conduct diplomacy in a dignified manner.The third indication is even more significant. Oli has consistently promoted anti-Indian nationalism, and India finds it difficult to trust him. But would that alone be enough to undermine his government?Throughout history, India has had a significant influence on Nepal’s political process and decision-making. Through its influence on individuals who’ve received gifts, benefits, and resources, some at the highest levels, India holds significant leverage over political decision-making and, by extension, over policies and processes.An old playbookIndia’s calculated relations with the Nepali state came to the fore in August this year when Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba visited India. New Delhi turned her visit into a high-profile affair even though she was unprepared to represent Nepal’s interests. Her visit, rather than building political trust, ended up creating more mistrust between Oli and New Delhi as well as between the Foreign Ministry and the Prime Minister’s Office.Although it is a matter of speculation, there are strong grounds to argue that such a courtesy would not have been extended to someone from the CPN (UML). It generates the question, at least in the public’s mind, whether India accorded special treatment to FM Rana as a “special” individual who happened to be the foreign minister and not as a representative of Nepal.Whether real or not, the perception that India is unhappy with Oli has fuelled the notion that the current government coalition is unstable.Throughout Nepal’s modern history, whenever top leaders are forced out, they tend to seek India’s support to regain power. I have heard firsthand from top political leaders that India used to put a pre-condition: First, demonstrate that you have people's support, then we will use our leverage to help you. Thus, the political leaders would launch a political campaign and hold mass meetings throughout the country. If the broader political environment favoured a political change, then India made the additional push.Now, as Pushpa Kamal Dahal tours the country, blaming a corrupt network of power brokers, we are reminded of this old playbook. During mass meetings, an embittered Dahal frequently alleges that “middlemen, brokers, and big cronies have gotten together, and with the strength of so-called numbers, have tried to strangle truth, justice…and good governance.” He also tells the public that his government was ousted because the investigations on corruption were leading to Budhanilkantha (Deuba’s residence) and Balkot (Oli’s residence).Oli’s inherent anti-Indian streakFor Oli, an inherent anti-Indian streak in his psychological make-up and an affinity with the Communist Party of China makes rapprochement with India difficult.In the last 10 years, Oli has made countless petty statements intended to rile and irritate India. He has also accorded China greater space in Nepal.In his book, former deputy PM Kamal Thapa expresses distaste at the way Oli made an unscheduled visit to China Gezhouba Group Corporation and disappeared for one and a half hours for a private meeting with Chinese Communist Party officials during his visit to China in 2016.Another issue is the Eminent Persons’ Group report, which Oli raised during the launch of Thapa’s book. “It would be good to receive the report,” he said during the programme. He made more anti-Indian remarks at another similar event.At present, any talk of the EPG report is viewed as an irritant by India, because it has consistently sent a clear diplomatic message that the report is dead. The unwillingness of a section of the Nepali populace to accept the message, including the CPN-UML, has not gone well in India.In a recent discussion programme, a former ambassador of India to Nepal indicated that the EPG report had become a new irritant in Nepal-India relations. He said that instead of insisting on the acceptance of the report, Nepal could pursue the individual issues identified. Trends in the last two decades indicate that instead of really trying to address the outstanding issues in Nepal-India relations, Nepali leaders are just interested in politicising them and gaining personal mileage.Nepal’s relationship with India has become more and more of a paradox. Nepal’s dominant ethno-nationalism is anti-Indian. Indeed, Nepal has many unresolved issues with India, but it’s economic development hinges on closer connectivity with India, which in turn hinges on trusted political relationships and ability to untangle complex issues.Snubbed by India, Oli is now headed to the US, where he could still get to meet a lukewarm Modi. He hopes to gain stature and make an impression at several forums including the UNGA, where he is scheduled to deliver speeches. We can only wish our PM well. \nFive years ago, on September 30, 2019, when KP Sharma Oli was prime minister for the second time, the government declared the entire country open-defecation free amid much fanfare. However, years later, thousands of people from across the country are getting infected with diarrheal diseases, including scores from cholera.Rautahat is among the nine districts reporting cholera outbreaks this year. Ward 4 of Rajpur Municipality has reported over 100 cases of diarrheal infection and hospitalisation. However, the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division said only 12 people from the municipality had so far contracted cholera.“Over 100 diarrheal patients from the municipality’s ward 4 have been hospitalised,” Khusid Ahmad, a health worker at the municipality, told the Post over the phone from Rautahat. “Contaminated drinking water could be the culprit for the cholera outbreak there. Samples of drinking water collected from affected areas have been sent for lab tests.”Apart from Rautahat, eight other districts—Lalitpur, Kathmandu, Kailali, Pyuthan, Makawanpur, Rolpa, Sindhupalchok, and Achham—have also reported cholera outbreaks this year. So far, the number of diarrheal patients who have contracted cholera is 95. Interestingly, most of the districts that have witnessed outbreaks of deadly cholera this year had years ago been declared open defecation-free.The Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool samples of the infected patients. Doctors say that detected cases of cholera infection could be just the tip of the iceberg, as most positive cases are being reported from the districts with active surveillance.Public health experts say outbreaks of cholera in multiple districts, even five years after the country was declared open defecation-free, show a huge gap between official declarations and progress on the ground.They say outbreaks of diarrheal diseases, including cholera, are directly linked to drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene conditions, and the country was declared open defecation-free without improving water and sanitation conditions.“Without ensuring the quality of drinking water and sanitation, among other things, authorities rushed to declare the entire country free from open defecation,” said Dr Mingmar Gyelgen Sherpa, former director general at the Department of Health Services. “Instead of improving basic water and sanitation infrastructure, we’ve focussed too much on outbreak management, and this is the wrong approach.”Even though toilets have been built in most households, open defecation is still widespread in many places. Drinking water samples collected from various parts of the country, including from the districts of the Kathmandu Valley, have been found contaminated with faecal coliform, which means the water the public uses for drinking is unsafe. The presence of faecal coliform, a microscopic organism that thrives in the intestines of warm-blooded animals or their faeces, indicates sewage contamination in the drinking water, according to doctors.A previous study had shown that 81 percent of water samples collected in the Kathmandu Valley were contaminated with deadly microbes.“We only focussed on expanding coverage of drinking water but did not pay attention to ensuring its safety,” said Dr Meghnath Dhimal, chief researcher at the Nepal Health Research Council. “Authorities concerned must also focus on improving the quality.”Experts say improving public hygiene is essential to ensuring water quality and avoiding diarrheal ailments. Awareness drives and health education play a crucial role in changing behaviours, which requires years of investment and continuous efforts.Along with investment in health education, attention should go to building climate-resilient infrastructures for drinking water and sanitation, as water resources have been contaminated by floodwaters in many districts. The effects of climate change have increased adverse events, including floods, which in turn have contaminated the source of drinking water, making people vulnerable to infection with diarrheal ailments.“Multiple agencies of the three tiers of government and non-governmental sectors have to make more effort to prevent diarrhoea outbreaks,” said Sherpa. “But there seems to be a lack of coordination among government agencies.” The World Health Organisation also stresses on a multifaceted approach as a key to controlling cholera and reducing deaths. \nRae was the envoy to Kathmandu during the promulgation of the 2015 constitution and the subsequent blockade. In this conversation, Rae talks about the evolution of Nepal-India ties since the blockade, regional geopolitics, what the two countries get wrong about each other, how New Delhi views Nepali communist parties and the governments they lead, and the change (if any) in India’s neighbourhood policy since the start of Narendra Modi’s third term in office. \nKunwar has been the MD for just under three years. Before coming back to her homeland to join Daraz Nepal, she worked at different American companies, including Amazon, the world’s biggest e-commerce platform. In this conversation, Kunwar talks about the opportunities and challenges of running an e-commerce enterprise in Nepal, as well as the country’s overall business environment.  \nWhen the Ranjitkar group was established, they discovered this forgotten dance and devoted two years to researching it.Now, they are reintroducing it during Indra Jatra by training the new generation in this traditional art form. \nHe is known for his nationalist legacy, marked by the amendment of Nepal's map to include territories like Kalapani, Lipulekh, and Limpiyadhura, and his strong stance against India, especially during and after the 2015 Nepal blockade.But how did he rise to become the country's powerful man? \nThe Nepali Congress is holding a ‘100-day campaign’ to rejuvenate party committees, strengthen the bond between the party's local representatives and central leaders, and pacify the party's dissenters.The party’s central committee meeting, which concluded on September 1, decided to run the 100-day campaign from September 23 to December 31. Krishna Prasad Paudel, chief secretary at the party office, says many central leaders have already reached the districts they are assigned to run campaign activities.According to Paudel, the party’s seven joint general secretaries lead the campaign in the seven provinces. Senior leaders Krishna Sitaula, Shashank Koirala, Bimalendra Nidhi, and Bijaya Kumar Gachhadar, along with some central committee leaders, have either reached the assigned districts or are on the way, Paudel said.“When the party’s senior leaders and central committee members are in their districts, vice presidents and general secretaries of the party will monitor the campaign activities,” Paudel told the Post. “If necessary, the vice presidents, the general secretaries, and the party president will go to some districts.”One of the main objectives of the campaign is to renew party membership. “We claim our party has 0.9 million members,” Paudel said. “During the campaign, leaders will check the trend of party members renewing their membership.”The campaign has been launched at a time when leaders have already started to devise their plans for the next general convention. As per the Congress statute, the party must hold its general convention every four years. The party’s 14th general convention was held in December 2021. If the statute is followed, the party’s next convention should be convened by the end of 2025.Some Congress leaders have floated the proposal of contesting the next general election on its own, without forging electoral alliance with other parties. General Secretary Gagan Thapa floated a proposal to this effect at the Mahasamiti meeting in February that forwarded the proposal to the central committee to take a decision on the issue.“If we are to fight elections on our own [without an alliance], we need a strong organisation, therefore the party is emphasising strengthening the party by conducting campaigns,” Paudel told the Post.But, for the party leaders, success of the campaign will largely depend on the way it will be run.“Will the party leaders try to connect the party organisation to the public or will they conduct it in just a traditional manner? This will determine the success of the campaign,” Guru Ghimire, a Congress leader, told the Post.Ghimire suggested that the party leaders should also gauge the strengths and weaknesses of other parties in the districts.Ghimire also advised the leaders not to use the campaign as an opportunity to promote factional activities.When public disenchantment towards the major parties is growing fast, the campaign the Congress has decided to carry forward could be a means to connect the leaders with the public, says a Congress leader.“This campaign will re-energise the relations between the party and the public, and the party should work hard to make this event fruitful without baggage of internal factions,” Sanjay Kumar Gautam, a Congress lawmaker, told the Post.Reconnecting with the public is a compulsion for the political parties, say political experts. Soon after the November 2022 election, major political parties including the Congress held several campaigns to reconnect with the people but the masses may not be quite impressed by the leaders’ announcements they make during the rallies unless they deliver when in power. Earlier, the CPN-UML carried out various drives such as ‘mission grassroots’, a march along Mid-Hill Highway. “Political parties’ efforts to get connected with the people is something commendable in itself,” Geja Sharma Wagle, a political analyst close to the Congress, told the Post. “But, if the political parties don’t deliver while they are in government, people might not be convinced by their pledges.”Wagle adds that as the Congress is in government, people take the leaders’ speeches seriously only if they work for them sincerely.During the 100-day campaign, the party has decided to inform the party members and local leaders regarding the seven-point agreement reached between the Congress and the CPN-UML on July 1. Based on the same agreement, the two parties formed the coalition government led by UML chair KP Sharma Oli on July 15. As per the deal, Oli will hand over the government leadership to Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba after two years.Besides their power-sharing in the federal government, the Congress and the UML have shared powers in provincial governments as well. While Koshi, Lumbini and Karnali provincial governments are led by the UML, Congress provincial lawmakers head Bagmati, Gandaki, and Sudurpaschim governments. The two big parties have backed Janamat Party to head the provincial government in Madhesh.During a meeting of the coalition partners held in Singha Durbar on September 9, Prime Minister Oli had reportedly complained that the coalition partners did not work enough to counter the ‘disinformation campaign of the opposition parties’ against the Oli government. “The opposition has spread confusion about the government, but the parties in government have not shown any interest in countering the disinformation,” the prime minister had reportedly said at the meeting. “All the ruling partners should defend the government.”Congress leaders will inform the party’s district representatives about the spirit of collaboration with the UML, constitutional amendments, and other issues. They are also responsible for informing the party members at the grassroots about policies such as the common minimum programme.Earlier this month, the Congress-UML coalition brought the programme that has, among other things, reiterated its commitment to reviewing the achievements made and weaknesses observed in the course of implementing the constitution in the past nine years. \nAfter being ousted from government for the first time in nine years, the CPN (Maoist Centre) appears to be at a turning point as it seeks to redefine its vision of socialism. In the wake of consultative meetings in seven provinces and its foreign units, party leaders have stressed the need for fresh ideas based on the party’s historic Chunwang meeting of 2005 that adopted ‘democratic republicanism’.Until this July, the party has continuously been in power since the promulgation of the constitution in 2015. Back during the insurgency days, the meeting held at Chunwang in Rukum district had endorsed the party’s political line advocating for promulgating a constitution through a constituent assembly. On this basis, the party in 2006 signed the Comprehensive Peace Accord with the then seven-party alliance and laid down arms to enter mainstream politics.The 2015 constitution envisions Nepal as a socialism-oriented country, with the Maoist Centre playing a key role in shaping that direction. But why, after all these years, is the party revisiting the question of socialism?Maoist Centre spokesman, Agni Sapkota, argues that the party has been discussing socialism in various forums. “But this time, we want a more intense and focussed discussion.” Tensions within the party also came to light during the party’s standing committee meeting in August where office bearers openly questioned the leadership of Pushpa Kamal Dahal. In response, the party decided to hold consultative meetings in all provinces to discuss the matter. Besides the provincial meetings, the party also consulted its foreign branches known as ‘pradesh committees’ in India, West Asia, and Eurasia.According to Sapkota, the Maoist Centre leadership got three mandates at the consultative meetings that concluded on September 20.“Besides the need for discussion on party ideology, the consultative meetings’ mandates include improving organisational management and updating party statute, changing leaders’ behaviour, and improving their secretariat work,” Sapkota told the Post. Likewise, another party leader, Dor Prasad Upadhyaya, says democratic socialism naturally aligns with the ideology of the Nepali Congress, whereas ‘people’s multiparty democracy’ is the ideology of the CPN-UML. “As for the Maoist Center, we lack a distinct political ideology clearly reflecting the party’s vision.”Although the party claims its ideology is ‘people’s democracy of the 21st century’, party leaders admit that its impact is diluted by lack of commitment. Party leaders said that there was no call for a leadership change during the consultative meetings. However, at the standing committee meeting in August, a deputy general secretary of the party, Janardan Sharma, submitted a 14-page document calling for a change in party leadership.Sharma and Barsha Man Pun—another deputy general secretary of the Maoist party—urged Dahal to pass over party reins to new generation leaders. According to leaders, some within the party feel that Dahal should not leave a leadership vacuum until a clear plan for leadership transition is in place.Likewise, Ram Karki, the party’s secretary, says the consultative meetings were focussed at preparing a political document that would be presented at the central committee meeting in November. “The consultative meetings were focused on the party’s diminishing influence in national politics,” Karki told the Post. “Despite our party leaders who were in government claiming that they did an excellent job, why hasn’t that reflected in the party’s life? This was a major concern expressed during the meetings.”Karki said the meeting also directed the party to remain open for cooperation with other parties with socialist inclinations. When asked about possible cooperation with the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), Karki dismissed the idea. “Lately, there have been some points of agreement between the two parties. But, I don’t see any prospect of the two parties getting into a working partnership,” Karki said. “The consultative meetings have said the party leadership is open to cooperation with socialist parties except the RSP.”The RSP—which was one of the junior partners in the immediate past government led by Maoist Centre chief Dahal before the government was toppled on July 12—appears to be on the same page with the Maoist Centre on many issues lately. But the two parties rule out cooperation on the political front.Party spokesperson Sapkota also says that his party can cooperate with the RSP in parliament on issues of public interest, but there is no possibility of forging a working alliance with the party. RSP chair Rabi Lamichhane, who presented his political document at the party's first national conference held for two days in Kathmandu earlier this month, also hinted at potential cooperation with like-minded parties. Despite this, RSP leaders declined cooperation with the Maoist Centre. The Maoist Centre’s consultative meetings have suggested that the party consider unification with other parties in order to revitalise the communist movement, Sapkota added.  \nThe Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), the fourth largest in Parliament, is fiercely resisting what it claims are government moves to arrest its chair, Rabi Lamichhane, over allegations of his involvement in cooperatives fraud. But all the other national parties seem to be in favour of his prosecution. Among the seven national parties in Parliament, there is a growing consensus for holding Lamichhane accountable. A party needs to win at least one FPTP seat and get three percent proportional representation votes to get national party status.Ruling coalition partners such as the Nepali Congress, the CPN-UML, Ashok Rai’s Janata Samajbadi Party, and the Janamat Party believe that RSP chair Lamichhane should face the law. Additionally, the CPN (Maoist Centre), the main opposition in Parliament, along with the Rastriya Prajantra Party and Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal (JSP-Nepal), both of which are outside the coalition, also support the parliamentary probe’s findings and advocate action against Lamichhane. The CPN (Unified Socialist), which is not a national party but has 10 seats in the lower house, has also joined the ranks of parties that want Lamichhane prosecuted. “Our party believes that, as a matter of principle, no innocent should be punished, and no guilty evade the law,” says the Maoist Centre Secretary Devendra Paudel.On the probe panel’s findings, Paudel said, “Evidence suggests that Lamichhane misused cooperative funds,” Paudel told the Post. “He should be held accountable for his actions as per the law.” A source close to Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak while talking to the Post said, “If everything goes as planned, the police will arrest Lamichhane soon.”However, during a recent interview with Kantipur Television’s Fireside program, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the chairman of the Maoist Centre, was noncommittal on whether Lamichhane should be prosecuted for misusing cooperative funds.But party secretary Paudel said his party would take a stand against Lamichhane’s misuse of cooperative funds.Unified Socialist spokesperson Jagannath Khatiwada says that the probe panel’s recommendations should be implemented. “Although our party has yet to take an official position on it, I can say that our leaders are discussing the parliamentary probe report and there is a general consensus that the report’s recommendations should be implemented.”“The report suggests that the government should further investigate and prosecute four key people [Rabi Lamichhane, GB Rai, Chhabi Joshi, and Kumar Ramtel] involved in the misuse of multiple cooperative funds, and our party supports the report,” Khatiwada told the Post. “Those proven guilty should be booked under the prevailing laws.” While Rai is on the run, Ramtel is in judicial custody of Kaski police. After arresting Joshi, Police are now waiting for the government’s green light to arrest Lamichhane, who has twice served as deputy prime minister and home minister.The Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal (JSP-Nepal), led by Upendra Yadav, also views Lamichhane as culpable in the misuse of the cooperative funds and disputes the RSP’s claim that he got a clean chit from the parliamentary special probe. “Our party does not want to disrespect any political leaders as such, but that does not mean a guilty individual should escape legal repercussions,” Manish Kumar Suman, the party central spokesperson, told the Post. “The report clearly indicates Lamichhane’s involvement in misusing cooperative funds, so there is no question of him getting a clear chit, unlike what the RSP leaders claim.” Rastriya Prajatantra Party Vice President Dhruba Bahadur Pradhan says the parliamentary probe panel, which investigated crisis-ridden cooperatives, has done its job and submitted a report and now it is the government’s responsibility to act on the recommendations.“As for our party’s position, Lamichhane should be prosecuted under the prevailing laws, as per the special committee’s report,” Pradhan told the Post. Lamichhane is accused of siphoning funds from multiple cooperatives to run the Gorkha Media Network, which operated the Galaxy 4k Television channel. The channel shut down last year. Chairman GB (Gitendra Babu) Rai and managing director Lamichhane jointly ran the media company before Lamichhane quit it to join politics in June 2022. On September 16, the parliamentary special committee submitted its report to Speaker Ghimire, who forwarded it to the government on the same day. On September 19, the Cabinet owned the report and ordered responsible ministries to act based on its findings. The probe panel’s report does not directly implicate Lamichhane in rerouting cooperative funds into the media, but it does label him guilty of using cooperative funds for Gorkha Media Network. The panel has recommended that the government prosecute Lamichhane; his business partner Rai; one of the founders of Gorkha Media Company, Chhabi Joshi; and board member Kumar Ramtel. As the panel report could not establish a direct link between Lamichhane and the rerouting of cooperative funds, RSP leaders interpret it as a ‘clean chit’ for their party chief. But leaders from other parties reject this claim.“The way RSP leaders are trying to interpret the probe panel’s report is distortion,” Pradhan said.Based on the report, the crime division of Nepal Police arrested Joshi, former deputy inspector general of Nepal Police and one of the founders of Gorkha Media Network, on the orders of Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak on Sunday. Following this, RSP chair Lamichhane organised a gathering of party sympathisers at his office to condemn the government amid rumours of his impending arrest. While addressing supporters at the RSP headquarters in Balaju, Kathmandu on Sunday evening, he urged them to be prepared to defend their new political force, claiming that a plan was afoot to ‘finish Rabi Lamichhane and the Rastriya Swatantra Party.’The erstwhile main opposition party, Nepali Congress, had continuously disrupted the parliamentary proceedings for over two months demanding a probe into the cooperatives scam, especially its connections to the Gorkha Media Network. In response, the immediate past government led by Maoist Centre chair Dahal had formed the parliamentary special probe panel.  \nRepresentatives at the first national conference of the Rastriya Swatantra Party saw factionalism within the party.Some of the representatives who arrived in Kathmandu three days ago for the two-day gathering starting on Tuesday said that growing factionalism is not healthy for the new political outfit promising to challenge traditional forces like the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML.“We were told that factionalism existed in our party in various forms, but we denied such claims. However, during our three days in Kathmandu, we witnessed it,” a group of party members told the Post. It seems that President Rabi Lamichhane and Vice-president Swarnim Wagle are not in the same boat on how the party should function, they added.RSP acting spokesperson Manish Jha explains that it is the lack of synchronisation—rather than differences—between the leaders. “People from various schools of thought came together to form the RSP. It is true that we lack synchronisation, but it would be wrong to portray it as differences.”Another leader of the party said on condition of anonymity that the party has two schools of thought—one based on democratic principles and the other opposed to it.RSP acting general secretary Kabindra Burlakoti claims that the party is united.In conversations with the Post, representatives from Kathmandu Valley, Pokhara and Chitwan sounded more optimistic with the central leadership while those from remote areas were confused over their take on the party’s central leadership.The representatives from Madhesh were mild in their opinion about the leadership.Moreover, representatives were also not very positive about the way the central leadership is investing their energy to claim that Lamichhane had got a clean chit from the parliamentary special committee formed to investigate crisis-ridden cooperatives.The probe panel, which submitted its report to the House of Representatives, has recommended the government prosecute Lamichhane, along with his former business partner GB (Gitendra Babu) Rai, board member of the media Kumar Ramtel and initial founder Chhabi Lal Joshi as per the prevailing laws. The inquiry committee, however, has said it couldn’t establish Lamichhane’s role in rerouting the cooperatives fund to Gorkha Media Network.“It would have been better had the central leadership waited to see how the government would take action,” the group of representatives from western Nepal told the Post. “In case Lamichhane is booked under the law, it could be counterproductive for the party in the long run.”The political campaign started by the RSP won’t get stalled even without Lamichhane, the representatives said, expressing their confidence in the party’s longevity.Lamichhane also presented a political report incorporating proposed statutory changes, the party’s commitments to voters, policy agenda presented by Swarnim Wagle at the Jaleshwar meeting and the conclusion drawn from the closed session of the national conference.Lamichhane’s report states that the policy paper presented in Jaleshwar defined ‘constitutional socialism’ as the party’s political ideology. Lamichhane also accuses the ruling Nepali Congress and CPN-UML of trying to lead the country to a two-party system by polarising smaller parties. “On the pretext of administrative reform, they are planning to wipe out the existence of small parties,” the report reads. “Potentially, this step can bring together new parties that want to be an alternative political force sooner or later.”Asked about RSP’s possible alliance with other parties, Burlakoti said though they are not in talks with the main opposition CPN (Maoist Centre), they are in regular contact with several independent candidates of last election.Asked if they are in discussion with Kathmandu Metropolitan City Mayor Balendra Shah, who won the 2022 local election independently, Burlakoti said: “Strategic moves are not to be disclosed.”However, when the national conference concluded after Lamichhane presented his report, representatives arriving from around the country were displeased.“This is not the way a party functions,” a representative told the Post, asking not to be named for fears of reprisal.When leaders put themselves at the centre and cadres in the periphery, the party’s downfall begins, another representative said. Acting General Secretary Burlakoti, however, defended the party leadership. “Our national conference was designed this way,” Burlakoti said. The report presented by the chair will be discussed in the party’s Mahakali-Mechi campaign that will start soon, he added.“At the national conference, we gave 5 percent of the total representatives (1500) time to speak, but those who spoke exceeded that number,” Burlakoti said.The conference, however, passed Lamichhane’s report. On Wednesday, Lamichhane announced the date of the party’s first general convention. It will be held on May 8-10 at a yet-undecided venue.“I would like to inform you that the Central Committee has become the general convention organising committee,” Burlakoti said. Lamichhane also announced the ‘Mahakali-Mechi Campaign’ to interact with the general public.In his report, Lamichhane has proposed a person not affiliated to any party to be elected the country’s president, directly elected executive head, or the prime minister. He also proposes giving the nation’s vice president the responsibility to chair the National Assembly.While the paper bats for a fully proportional electoral system, it says provincial assemblies cannot be accepted in the current shape.However, this does not mean the RSP is against the federal structure gained through the sacrifice of thousands of people, another representative said. “Our party has no strength to amend the constitution and scrap the federal structure. Therefore, for the time being, voices are growing among the party members about accepting the present political structure,” Khemraj Koirala, a conference representative from Kailali told the Post.Party members also suggested downsizing the number of ministers to make the provincial system functional, Koirala said.The report also stands for reducing the number of municipalities to less than 500, from the current 753. \nCPN-UML and Nepali Congress pledge constitutional amendments based on review of past performance, prioritizing political stability and protection of constitutional pillars, with commitments in various sectors including economic development, social justice, transitional justice, and cooperative regulation.\nTicket bookings for Dashain public transport, expected to serve 2 million travellers leaving Kathmandu, open this Saturday with online and counter options amid safety measures.\nA pressure cooker suspected as a bomb was found in front of Balambu Secondary School in Chandragiri Municipality, Kathmandu, causing panic and prompting a bomb disposal team from the Nepal Army to safely dispose of the object.\nKathmandu Metropolitan City has prohibited construction within 40 meters of both sides of rivers, based on a Supreme Court verdict, also banning sewage disposal and mandating groundwater recharge measures.\nAfter a century-long hiatus due to the 1934 earthquake, the Ranjitkar Group has revived the Ranjitkar Lakhe dance in Bhaktapur, engaging youth in the preservation of their cultural heritage.\nThe Lions Club of Kathmandu Corporate, Nepal MD325-D has felicitated various personalities as part of its endeavour to recognise the contribution of the individuals and business entities for the society.As part of its campaign, the Lions Club of Kathmandu honoured Prateek Pradhan with Social Journalism Award, Sylapa T Rimponche with Social Spiritual Award, Erika Gurung with Social Player Award, Ramesh Corporation with Social Corporate House Award, Rajendra Malla with Social Corporate Leader Award and Rajesh Hamal with Social Celebrity Award.Likewise, Chandra Ghimire is honoured with Social Bureaucratic Award, Binod Das with Sports Management Award, Anil Kedia with Social Academic Award, Mohan Ojha with Social Management Award and Surya Nepal with Corporate Social Responsibility Award.The Lionism embarked in Nepal in 1971 as the Lions Club of Biratnagar under the stewardship of former Prime Minister Matrika Prasad Koirala.The Lions Clubs International says it has over 2,000 clubs operating across the nation. \nPeter England, a leading international menswear brand from the house of Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail Ltd., has opened its new flagship store in Kathmandu. With this new launch, the brand aims to enhance its presence further and cater to the growing demand for lifestyle products by offering premium-quality choices to men across the country, the company said in a statement.Founded in 1889 in Ireland, Peter England is India’s largest menswear brand. Spanning 750 sq ft, the new store offers a comprehensive selection of shirts, T-shirts, trousers, denim, occasion wear like suits, blazers, and loungewear, along with accessories like belts, ties, and handkerchiefs designed to meet the diverse needs of modern consumers. Commenting on the launch, Anil S Kumar, chief operating officer of Peter England, said, “We are happy to expand our presence in Nepal by launching our third store in Kathmandu, the nation's capital and the largest city. Peter England has always been synonymous with trust, quality, and affordability, and we are excited to offer our customers an elevated shopping experience.” \nBeanstalk Asia Nepal, Water Communication, and Nepal Traveller hosted a two-day Nepal Hospitality Conclave in Kathmandu.The event brought together key stakeholders to discuss challenges, opportunities, and strategies in the tourism industry. Supported by Hotel Association Nepal, this Hospitality Conclave was hosted in line with Nepal’s declaration of 2025 as a ‘Special Tourism Year’ and the ‘Nepal Tourism Decade.’ To capture and embrace the spirit of this tourism decade, the Conclave featured over 20 national and international panellists speaking on important tourism topics to maximise Nepal’s tourism potential, including marketing and promotion, destination development, investment, and policy reforms needed for tourism prosperity. This event was supported by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Trade and Competitiveness and over a dozen national and multinational private firms. In her remarks, USAID Nepal’s Deputy Mission Director, Karen Welch, said, “USAID remains deeply committed to strengthening Nepal’s tourism sector through collaboration with the government of Nepal, local communities, and businesses like yours.” \nThe International Balloon Festival will be held in Pokhara, with 30 countries participating. Nepal Balloon Pvt Ltd will organise the festival from December 24 to January 1, coinciding with Christmas and the New Year.The festival will cover a stretch of three kilometres, from Lauruk in Pokhara to Chankhapur in Pame.Bikram Bade, president of Nepal Balloon, said that preparations are underway for the first-ever festival of its kind in Nepal.According to Bade, the festival will feature 30 commercial balloon companies from around the world, including Nepal. \"The festival aims to promote tourism in Pokhara and Nepal at the international level, while also advancing adventure tourism,\" said Bade. He added that the festival is expected to attract more domestic and foreign tourists, helping to revitalise Nepal’s tourism sector post-Covid.Bade expressed optimism that the festival would add a new dimension to Pokhara's tourism and boost tourism activities in the region. He emphasised that the event will be instrumental in reactivating the tourism sector, which has slowed down due to the pandemic, and in attracting a new wave of domestic and foreign visitors.Dhanraj Acharya, mayor of Pokhara Metropolitan City, expressed his enthusiasm for the festival, stating that it is a welcome addition to Pokhara’s tourism calendar. He pledged his support as a protector and promoter of similar events in the city.BB Dhakal, director of Nepal Balloon, said Pokhara, rich in natural resources, has been evolving into an adventure tourism destination. \"In this context, the balloon festival will help solidify Pokhara's reputation as an adventure tourism hub.”The concept of international balloon festivals isn't new. The Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta, first held in the US in 1972, sees about 500 hot air balloons flying annually in New Mexico, attracting over a million tourists. Other notable festivals include the Bristol International Balloon Fiesta in England, the Saga International Balloon Fiesta in Japan, the Mondial Air Balloons Event in France, and the Cappadocia International Balloon Festival in Turkey.During the Pokhara festival, professional pilots representing different countries will fly hot air balloons daily—in the morning, afternoon, and the evening. The festival will see around 500 commercial flights and is expected to host around 3,000 passengers, along with 300 non-commercial flights.The organiser said a mini balloon show will also be organised, with performances by renowned national and local artists. Traditional Nepali cultural exhibitions and displays from other countries will be featured. Attendees can also enjoy local food stalls and various entertainment activities.The organisers estimate that Rs68.3 million will be spent on the festival, which is expected to boost Pokhara's post-pandemic tourism recovery.Hot air balloon flights typically last around 40 minutes, offering a panoramic view of the Pokhara valley, including the majestic snow-capped ranges of Annapurna, Machhapuchhre, and Dhaulagiri. In addition to the stunning sunrise and sunset views, the festival will feature night balloon glows, daily 20-minute fireworks displays, balloon races, concerts, various games, food courts, cultural dances, DJ music, and night camps.Balloon Nepal, established in 2016, has been operating commercial hot air balloon flights in Pokhara since 2018. The company recently participated in the February International Balloon Fiesta, 2024, held in Thailand. \nThe severe flooding and landslides that Nepal has faced for the last few days have pushed food and vegetable prices up in Kathmandu, as roads connecting the Valley have been obstructed since Saturday.Traders say that delays in opening the highways could push the prices of foods and vegetables further.In the Capital, the record rainfall in 54 years inundated most of the warehouses of essential food items, traders said. The fruits and vegetable market in Balkhu has been flooded, while the Kalimati market was partially affected.Traders say that the supply of food and fresh vegetables dropped sharply, particularly from Dhading and Kavre, the key source districts to Kathmandu, as landslides have blocked highways.The lifeline for Kathmandu has been severed since Saturday with the Tribhuvan and Prithvi highways being blocked.The BP Highway linking Kathmandu with eastern Tarai has also been blocked. Kalimati, which houses the country’s largest fruits and vegetables market, received 156 tonnes of vegetables on Saturday, down nearly a fourth from 571 tonnes on Friday.“There is a supply constraint due to landslides in most of the highways connecting Kathmandu. As a result of low supply and high demand, prices of vegetables have increased,” said Binay Shrestha, information officer at the Kalimati Fruits and Vegetable Market Development Board.“Today [Sunday], we received only 38 tonnes of vegetables till 4:00 pm. These vegetables are from the Valley, produced on tunnel farms.”However, tunnel farming has also been largely affected by the floods. Shrestha said that as soon as the highways are cleared, supply will become normal.The wholesale price of most of the seasonal green vegetables has crossed the Rs100 per kg mark.According to the board's wholesale price index, the big price of tomatoes increased by 29.41 percent to Rs110 per kg, the price of cowpeas jumped by 46.67 percent to Rs110 per kg, the bitter gourd price increased by 69.23 percent to Rs110 per kg, and the smooth gourd price increased by 80 percent to Rs135 per kg.Potato price increased by 7.25 percent to Rs74 per kg. Other vegetables like tomato (local and tunnel), onion, carrot, cabbage, cauli local, French bean, bottle gourd, squash, green leafy vegetables, mushroom, cucumber, green chilli and coriander greens have gone up after the flood and landslide.The vegetable price was already high, and an additional jump amid the nearing festivals has worried consumers.According to a central bank report released last Thursday, the food and beverage inflation stood at 6.17 percent in mid-August compared to the same period last year.Under the food and beverage category, the year-on-year price index of the vegetable sub-category increased 19.07 percent, pulses and legumes 12.09 percent, cereal grains and their products 9.15 percent, and milk products and eggs 3.66 percent.A few wholesalers the Post talked to said that flood impacts on the warehouses have been big, which could increase the prices.Pabitra Bajracharya, president of Nepal Retailers Association, however, said that the retailers have been less affected.“As there is sufficient stock of food items like rice, edible oil, pulses and legumes, I do not think the prices of essential consumable goods will go up,” he said. “However, the opportunist wholesalers may hike the price on the pretext of floods and landslides.”Retailers said that the wholesalers have already hiked the price of edible oil.“I have been selling sunflower oil at Rs210 per litre. Today (Sunday), the distributor quoted Rs222 per litre wholesale. I have to sell the edible oil at Rs240 per litre to consumers,” said Bajracharya. That’s a hike of 15 percent overnight. “Even I am shocked at the new rate,” said Bajracharya.Retailers said there is no reason for the price of rice, pulses, and legumes to rise immediately as the traders have sufficient stock. However, as most of the traders' warehouses in the Kuleshower and Balkhu area were flooded on Saturday, damaging their goods, these traders may recover the losses by passing the burden on to consumers, Bajracharya said.Subodh Kumar Gupta, immediate past president of the Association of Nepalese Rice, Oil and Pulses Industries, said, “We have stocks of rice, edible oil, pulses and legumes for three months in different factories and warehouses outside the Kathmandu valley. In Kathmandu, the stocks may last a month. But the transportation problem is prolonged, and there could be a shortage of food items in Kathmandu Valley.”Consumer rights activists said traders may create artificial shortages to jack up prices in difficult times when the government’s monitoring of the market is poor.“The government’s supply utilities like the Food Management and Trading Company and the Salt Trading [Corporation Limited] have no sufficient stock of food. The government's preparedness to check the market price during a disaster like this has not been up to the mark,” said Madhav Timalsina, president of the Consumer Rights Investigation Forum.He said it is unjustifiable to raise the prices of food, vegetables, and fruits exorbitantly because of the partial flood in the Kuleshwar area and vegetable market.“If traders are seen hiking the prices, they need to be booked immediately.”Even in the past, such as during the border blockade and the Covid-19 period, the government mechanism utterly failed to control the prices. \nUS President Joe Biden will announce on Tuesday the donation of 1 million mpox vaccine doses and at least $500 million to African countries to support their response to the outbreak, according to a senior administration official.Biden will make the announcement in New York, where he is attending the United Nations General Assembly, and call on other countries to follow suit, the person told Reuters.In August, the World Health Organization declared mpox a global public health emergency for the second time in two years, following an outbreak of the viral infection in the Democratic Republic of Congo that has spread to neighbouring countries and beyond, including India, raising alarm.“It wouldn’t be a huge surprise if there were a case in the United States, either,” the official said, noting that recent cuts in pandemic support by Congress may hamper a domestic response.“We’re really squeezing right now to be able to respond effectively in this moment. And I think anticipating potentially additional cuts in the future will make it more and more difficult for us to have a robust response to these types of outbreaks.”Mpox can spread through close contact. Usually mild, it is fatal in rare cases. It causes flu-like symptoms and pus-filled lesions on the body.The outbreak in Congo began with the spread of an endemic strain, known as clade I. But a new variant, clade Ib, appears to spread more easily through routine close contact, including sexual contact.The expectation is that the US donated doses will be of the Bavarian Nordic vaccine known as Jynneos in the United States, and many will come from a stockpile in the United States. The 1 million doses is in addition to the 60,000 previously donated shots.The US official said the administration expects Gavi, a public-private alliance which co-funds vaccine purchases for low-income countries, to distribute the donated vaccines.“We feel really strongly that Gavi is the multilateral institution that is best positioned to procure and equitably distribute vaccines,” the official said.Last week, Gavi said it will buy 500,000 doses of Bavarian Nordic's vaccine, its first purchase to help battle the outbreak.The Biden administration is also pushing for more vaccines to be manufactured in low and middle-income countries, and is working with Brazil to identify how the Group of 20 club of nations can support the mpox response.There is not currently a manufacturer in Africa that is able to make the complex drug substance needed to make the vaccine, the US official said. \nAt least 190 women from 51 districts died of complications during childbirth in the fiscal year 2023-024, data provided by the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services show. The actual number of maternal deaths due to birth-related complications could be much higher, as maternal and perinatal death surveillance is being carried out in 51 districts only, officials say.“Maternal deaths from childbirth-related complications could be significantly underreported, as we are only tracking cases in 51 districts,” said Nisha Joshi, a public health official at the division. “We have no data on maternal and perinatal deaths in the rest of the districts.”In the fiscal year 2022-023, 191 maternal deaths were recorded across 49 districts. Nepal reduced the maternal mortality rate from 239 per 100,000 births in 2016 to 151 per 100,000 in 2021, according to the national census carried out by the National Statistics Office. Earlier, the country had reduced the maternal mortality rate from 539 per 100,000 births in 1996 to 239 per 100,000 births in 2016—for which the country even received a Millennium Development Goals award. The health target under the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals is to reduce the maternal mortality rate to 75 per 100,000 births by 2030.The latest census report has shown that 622 maternal deaths were recorded in a year. Officials at the Health Ministry concede that the number of deaths reported from 51 districts is only around 30 percent of the total maternal deaths occurring across the country.They complained that the lack of maternal and perinatal death surveillance programmes in all districts is the main reason for the underreporting of maternal deaths. “Due to budget constraints, we could not expand the maternal and perinatal death surveillance to other districts this year,” said Joshi. “We also have problems in the reporting system, and deaths that occur in villages of the districts without surveillance programmes go unreported.”Maternal health experts say that concerned authorities are keeping themselves in the dark by not conducting studies in all districts. “Without knowing the actual situation, effective planning is not possible, which means efforts to reduce ongoing deaths may not succeed,” said Dr Ganesh Dangal, a maternal health expert. A huge budget is not necessary to carry out death surveillance. So this programme should be enforced mandatorily in all districts immediately.”Maternal and perinatal death surveillance is a key intervention for improving maternal, perinatal, and neonatal survival rates. Experts say such surveillance provides an understanding of the number and causes of deaths, enabling more targeted and effective interventions.Nepal strives to reduce the deaths of mothers and babies. However, it lacks maternal and perinatal death surveillance in all districts.Perinatal death is the death of a baby between 22 weeks of gestation (or weighing 500g) and seven days after birth.The World Health Organisation said that maternal and perinatal death surveillance and response (MPDSR) is an essential quality improvement intervention, which permits the identification, notification, quantification and determination of causes and avoidability of maternal and neonatal deaths and stillbirth to orient the measures necessary for their prevention.According to the UN health body, systematic analyses of overall mortality trends and events and contributing factors leading to individual deaths can identify barriers in health systems and inspire local solutions to prevent such deaths in the future.Studies carried out in the past show that excessive bleeding after childbirth, pre-eclampsia and eclampsia (pregnancy-related high blood pressure disorders) are some of the reasons for maternal deaths.The World Health Organisation said postpartum haemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal mortality in low-income countries and the primary cause of nearly a quarter of all maternal deaths globally. Most deaths resulting from the said complication occur during the first 24 hours after birth.Gynaecologists say tears in the cervix or tissues of the vagina, tear in a blood vessel in the uterus, bleeding in hidden tissue area or space in the pelvis, blood clotting disorders, and placenta problems are among the causes of postpartum haemorrhage.Every year, over 600,000 women deliver babies in Nepal. \nAs many as 17 people, including children, have died, and 63 others have been infected with the Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus since the start of the monsoon in June this year.Twenty-nine districts, including those in the Kathmandu Valley, have reported infection from the deadly virus, while 12 districts—Kailali, Kapilvastu, Palpa, Chitwan, Parsa, Rautahat, Sarlahi, Siraha, Dhanusha, Sindhuli, Jhapa and Sunsari—have reported deaths from the infection.“We have alerted agencies concerned to conduct awareness drives and implement other prevention measures in the districts where Japanese encephalitis infections or deaths have been reported,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division. “We have also requested various aid agencies, including the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation, to supply JE vaccine.”Japanese encephalitis is a viral brain infection caused by the JE virus, which is endemic in Asia and parts of the Western Pacific. According to the World Health Organization, it is a mosquito-borne flavivirus, belonging to the same family as dengue, Zika, yellow fever, and West Nile viruses. The virus kills a third of those who fall ill and leaves up to half of those who survive with severe life-long disabilities, according to the UN health body.Officials say that September and October are the peak months for JE outbreaks.Health officials say this year’s death rate from the JE virus has exceeded 27 percent, and among the deceased, the number of children under 15 years of age is very high. Nepal has included the vaccine in its routine immunisation list, which the government provides free of cost to all children.The country started administering the vaccine doses in 2006, eight years before the World Health Organization officially issued prequalification certification, due to the high infection and deaths from the virus at the time. In 2005, JE killed nearly 2,000 people in Nepal—mostly children from the districts of Tarai region. In the first phase, all populations of the highly-affected four districts, Banke, Bardia, Dang, and Kailali, were inoculated with the JE vaccine. Later, the vaccination programme was expanded to 19 other affected districts, and children under 15 were inoculated.The government integrated the JE vaccine into the routine immunisation list in 2015. Even though the vaccine is included in the regular immunisation list, several people still die, and dozens get infected by the deadly virus every year.Data from the Health Ministry show that less than 50 percent of the infected patients were found inoculated with the vaccine.Doctors say the disease has no cure, so treatment focuses on managing symptoms. However, safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent infection. Health officials said they are aware of the deadly disease outbreak and have already started consulting aid agencies for help to finance the JE vaccination programme.However, officials at the Department of Health Services said that none of the donors have taken health officials' requests seriously or shown interest in supporting the immunisation drive.Public health experts say that this is the right time to vaccinate all those at risk. Even if the vaccine does not help in outbreak management, it provides immunity from future infections. The JE virus is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected Culex mosquitoes. Pigs and ducks are considered natural reservoirs of the virus.Doctors advise taking precautions to avoid mosquito bites, such as using mosquito repellents, wearing long-sleeved clothes, and getting vaccinated if one lives in or is travelling to disease-endemic areas. They also stress the importance of awareness and timely treatment to prevent infections and deaths.An estimated 12.5 million people are thought to be at high risk of JE infection in Nepal. \nDusit Princess Kathmandu is organising a five-day trout festival at its SOI restaurant. The dishes will be available for order from 12:30 pm to 10:00 pm every day till August 30. In celebration of Nepal’s rivers and lakes, which provide an ideal environment for high-quality trout, the Director of Culinary Food and Beverage Service, Chef Utpal Mondal, and his team at Dusit Princess Kathmandu have crafted a menu showcasing the flavours and versatility of locally sourced trout. “As the festive month of Shrawan ends, people focus on healthy and nutritious food. Trout, rich in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and essential minerals, offers a heart-friendly option that checks all the boxes from a nutritional and culinary standpoint,” says Mondal.He adds that the goal of the culinary event is to offer their guests a rare opportunity to experience a wide variety of trout dishes they wouldn’t typically find at home.The event menu features twelve unique dishes, six of which are drawn from diverse culinary traditions across continents. Three dishes are inspired by oriental cuisine, while the remaining three highlight flavours from Nepal and India. The menu has been designed to include various dishes, from soups and starters to main courses, including Mexican, Italian, Continental, and Thai flavours.While discussing the event’s highlights, Mondal said, “The celebration presents a unique opportunity for guests to indulge in a diverse range of trout-based dishes, something they wouldn’t typically have the chance to experience elsewhere.” \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nNepal were finally able to register victory in Canada when they defeated Oman by 37 runs in their second match of the Canada T20I series in King City on Sunday.Nepal were winless in Canada, losing their three ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup League 2 matches before their last game of the series against Oman was washed out by rain. The Rhinos also lost the opening game of the T20I series against Canada by 14 runs.The victory finally ended Nepal's winless run of eight straight matches that stretched back to the T20 World Cup warm up against Canada in Dallas.However, their League 2 flop in King City will hurt more as they have managed to win only one in their eight matches. The Canada no show also extended their losing streak in the League 2 to five straight games. Nepal sit in the seventh position in the eight-team League 2 with just three points.Rohit Paudel’s team will now look to continue the momentum when they face the same sides (Canada and Oman) in the second round of the T20I series before heading to the United States to participate in the League 2 United States Tri-series that also involves Scotland.Gulsan Jha has been outstanding in Canada and finally succeeded to guide the Rhinos to victory after his half-century and a fifer could not stop Nepal from suffering a loss against Oman in the 50-over format League 2.On Sunday, Jha played an aggressive knock of 40 not out off 17 balls smashing three fours and three sixes helping his side post a decent total of 176-6 from their 20 overs.Anil Sah and Aasif Sheikh were also able to find their form finally after a poor show with the bat in their previous three outings in Canada. Sheikh’s top score was 11 in his three previous games, while Sah could not even touch the double digit figures.Sah scored 27 off 21 and Sheikh made 27 off 22 to give Nepal a good start.Dev Khanal played his second T20I after making debut against Canada on Saturday and failed to impress as he was dismissed for two runs.Captain Paudel also struggled to find consistency with the bat, falling cheaply for two.Kushal Malla returned to the squad after being dropped in the League 2 tri-series and contributed a significant 30 off 26.Bhurtel was also back in the playing XI but was demoted to number six after failing to make his mark in the opening order. He finally did some good work scoring 20 runs (17 balls) and supported Jha’s explosive innings.Dipendra Singh Airee also came out of the dug out after being benched in the League 2 and played a quick-fire 18 off just five balls.In reply, Karan KC took 3-36, Bhurtel picked 2-32 including the dangerman Shoaib Khan, and Jha returned the match figures of 2-14 to wrap up Oman for 139.Shoaib top-scored for Oman with 45 runs off 39 balls.Rafiullah made 33 runs facing 12 deliveries. \nThe 2025 FIFA Club World Cup final will be held at the New Jersey home of the NFL’s New York Giants and New York Jets, world soccer’s governing body announced on Saturday along with the venue lineup for the revamped tournament.The expanded 32-team tournament, which will feature leading clubs from around the world, will be held in 12 stadiums around the United States next year from June 15-July 13.The open-air stadium for the final, which opened in 2010 and has a capacity of 82,500, held the Copa America Centenario final in 2016 when Chile denied Lionel Messi’s Argentina for a second time in a penalty shootout.The venue was also announced earlier this year as the site of the 2026 World Cup final.The other venues, mostly a mix of NFL and Major League Soccer stadiums, are in Atlanta, Charlotte, Cincinnati, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville, Philadelphia, Seattle, Washington and two in Orlando.The Club World Cup will have eight groups of four with the top two teams from each group advancing to the single-match knockout stage from the round of 16 to the final.FIFPRO’s European member unions have started legal action against FIFA over the Club World Cup due to concerns over the impact of a crammed calendar on players’ health and performance. \nAll Nepal Football Association (ANFA) on Saturday postponed the ANFA Women’s League football match between Nepal Police Club and Sankata until further notice.“The match between Nepal Police Club and Sankata Club has been postponed until further notice due to adverse weather conditions,” ANFA said in a statement.Police, who have already qualified for the Super League, and the already-eliminated Sankata were scheduled to clash in the final game of the first round on Saturday.Police have already secured third position in the ten-team standing with a game in hand. They have 18 points.The top five teams progressed to the Super League, which will be played in a double round robin format.Defending champions Armed Police Force Club topped the table with 25 points, while Tribhuvan Army Club secured second position in the league with 22 points.Waling Municipality (15 points) and Koshi Province (14 points) are the other teams who advanced into the second round.Bagmati Youth Club, Chandrapur Municipality, Karnali Province and Sudurpaschim Province were also eliminated from the first round.ANFA is yet to announce the schedule for the Super League stage. \nRashmi Kumari Ghising scored five goals, including two penalties, as defending champions Armed Police Force Club destroyed Bagmati Youth Club 7-0 at the ANFA Complex in Lalitpur on Friday—ensuring that they advance into the Super League as table toppers.Anita Basnet and Sabita Rana Magar were also on target for APF, who extended their winning streak to eight matches after playing a 0-0 draw against Nepal Police Club in their opening match.APF, who have 25 points from nine matches, remain clear favourites to win the title as they look to win a fourth title in a row. They have now scored a total of 53 goals against the two conceded.Ghising has scored more than four goals in three straight games now. She also scored five against Koshi in APF’s 8-0 victory and four in APF’s 19-0 mauling of Sudurpaschim.Ghising also leads the goal-scoring tally with 17 goals—nine more than Waling Municipality’s Jackline Nassali who is second in the list.Ghising was unstoppable on a rainy afternoon against already eliminated Bagmati at Satdobato again, scoring twice in the space of five minutes towards the end of the first half that put APF in complete control of the game.Her first came in the 35th minute. Anita KC was the provider as she raced into the penalty box to find a through pass from Anita Basnet, used her intelligence to trick advancing Bagmati goalkeeper Sujata Tamang and laid it for Ghising to slam into the empty net.Ghising doubled APF’s lead in the 40th minute when her powerful header off a cross from Basnet deflected off Bagmati’s Sunita Bhulan before finding the bottom corner.Basnet then combined with Ghising again to further APF’s lead two minutes after the restart after good works from Preeti Rai and KC.Ghising completed her hat-trick in the 58th minute through a penalty that was awarded to APF after Bagmati captain Divya Yasmali Magar handled the ball inside the box.More misery was piled on Bagmati after their first choice goalie Tamang had to be stretchered off after suffering an injury.Ghising added more salt to Bagmati wounds, converting another penalty past substitute goalkeeper Karun Budhathoki in the 82nd minute after Bhulan handled the ball.Ghising then netted her fifth in the 88th minute poking home a powerful shot from close range after Saru Limbu set her up.Rana Magar rounded off a comprehensive victory for APF, tapping a cross from Rai. Army hit five past KarnaliTribhuvan Army Club finished the first round in the second position on 22 points with a 5-0 thrashing of Karnali Province later in the afternoon.Army, who are looking to win their maiden title, are the other high-scoring team in the league and showed their firepower going up 3-0 after 12 minutes, with Chandra Bhandari, Bimala Chaudhary and Amisha Karki finding the net.Dipa Shahi and Dipa Rai added Army’s fourth and fifth in the second half to complete a comfortable win.Army have scored a total of 51 goals from their nine games. They have conceded four.Nepal Police Club, who have also qualified for the second round, take on Sankata in the last fixture of the first round on Saturday.Waling Municipality and Koshi Province are the other teams to have progressed into the Super League, which will be played in a double round robin format.The top four teams in the Super League will play Qualifiers, Eliminator and Final. \nWaling Municipality and Koshi Province progressed to the Super League stage of the ANFA Women’s League on Thursday.Waling defeated Chandrapur Municipality 2-1 while Koshi thumped Sudurpaschim Province 4-0 at the ANFA Complex in Lalitpur that secured both a top-five finish after the first round.Defending champions Armed Police Force Club lead the standings with 22 points. Tribhuvan Army Club are second and Nepal Police Club occupy the third spot.The victories ensured Waling a fourth-placed finish and Koshi fifth position in the ten-team standings.Sudurpaschim, who were already eliminated before the Koshi clash, concluded their struggling season without a victory and at the bottom of the table.Chandrapur crashed out after loss to Waling, while the outcomes also eliminated unfortunate Bagmati Youth Club and Sankata from the race for top-five finish without playing their final league matches.Both Waling and Koshi needed a victory to book their tickets to the remaining two spots in the second round.Waling were the first to do so, courtesy of goals from Sukriya Miya and Jackline Nassali.Miya gave Waling the lead in the fifth minute with a beautiful volley after Chandrapur goalkeeper Usha Thapa’s failed attempt to grab a corner landed directly into the path of Maya.Uganda forward Nassali doubled Waling’s lead in the 37th minute, beautifully finishing off a counter attack after she was set up by Sushma Tamang.Sunita Sunar gave Chandrapur hopes of comeback, pulling their first goal of the game in the 50th minute with a cool finish.But Waling held on to the slim lead to qualify for the next round.Koshi had a relatively easier task against Sudurpaschim and romped to victory comfortably after Samikshya Magar hit a brace. Mamata Raut and Khusma Rai were also on target for Koshi.Magar was also involved in Koshi’s opening goal as she set up Raut whose lofted shot stung the palm of Sudurpaschim goalkeeper Tikesori Saud before finding the net in the 24th minute.Magar furthered Koshi’s lead in the 53rd minute. Raut was the provider. She intercepted a poor goal kick from Amita Bhul and quickly fed Sunita Sarkar on the right. Sarkar then launched a perfect cross for Magar to tap home.Magar then added Koshi’s third in the 65th minute thanks to Purnima Rai’s skilled footwork. Rai showed her control to receive a through pass from Neha Kumari Chaudhary inside the box and artfully put the ball through advancing goalie Saud and two other defenders. Magar was waiting in front of the empty net and tucked away a simple finish.Khusma wrapped up the victory in the 85th minute with a powerful long ranger.The Super League will be played in a double robin format. The top four finishers will compete in the Qualifiers, Eliminator and final. \nJapan’s incoming prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba, said on Monday he will call a general election for Oct. 27 following his victory in one of the closest ever leadership races for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party.The poll, which will come a year early and ahead of the US presidential election in November, will decide which party controls parliament’s lower house. Lawmakers there will meet tomorrow to confirm him as the country’s next prime minister.“It is important for the new administration to be judged by the people as soon as possible,” Ishiba said at a press conference at LDP headquarters in Tokyo.Japanese shares fell more than 4% in early trading on Monday as the yen strengthened and Japanese government bonds jumped in reaction to the leadership win by Ishiba, who is seen as a monetary policy hawk.Ishiba on Monday began picking government and party officials who will contest the upcoming general election with him.So far those include two rival candidates in the leadership race, Katsunobu Kato as finance minister and Yoshimasa Hayashi to stay on as chief cabinet secretary, a pivotal post that includes the role of top government spokesman, two sources familiar with the appointments earlier told Reuters.A close Ishiba ally, Takeshi Iwaya, a former defence chief, will take over as foreign minister, while Gen Nakatani will return to the defence ministry, a position he held in 2016, said the sources, who asked not to be identified because they are not authorized to speak to the media, confirming earlier media reports.Yoji Muto, a former junior minister, will take charge at the economy, trade and industry ministry, a separate source said.Not included in his picks, however, is Sanae Takaichi, the hardline conservative he beat by 215 votes to 194 on Friday in the closest leadership election in almost seven decades.Takaichi’s absence could make it difficult for Ishiba to manage a fractious ruling group roiled by scandals that have sapped its public support.Media reports that Takaichi has declined a post “could point to a weakness in Ishiba’s support base, which could cause him problems going forward,” said Hiroshi Shiratori, a political science professor at Hosei University in Tokyo.Ishiba picked another rival, Shinjiro Koizumi, as his election campaign chief, along with former Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, a Koizumi backer, who is the party’s new vice president. Both joined him at his press conference on Monday.Ishiba, 67, won the LDP leadership race on his fifth attempt with strong backing from rank-and-file members.He is however, considered something of troublemaker by many of his parliamentary colleagues for often defying party policy. On Friday before his run off election against Takaichi he apologised to LDP lawmakers for his “shortcomings”. \nA Palestinian militant group said on Monday that three of its leaders were killed in an Israeli strike on Beirut, the first attack within city limits as Israel escalated hostilities against Iran’s allies in the region.The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) said the three leaders were killed in a strike that targeted Beirut’s Kola district.The strike hit the upper floor of an apartment building in the Kola district of Lebanon’s capital, Reuters witnesses said.There was no immediate comment from Israel’s military.Israel’s increasing frequency of attacks against the Hezbollah militia in Lebanon and the Houthi militia in Yemen have prompted fears that Middle East fighting could spin out of control and draw in Iran and the United States, Israel’s main ally.The PFLP is another militant group taking part in the fight against Israel.Israel on Sunday launched airstrikes against the Houthi militia in Yemen and dozens of Hezbollah targets throughout Lebanon after earlier killing the Hezbollah leader.The Houthi-run health ministry said at least four people were killed and 29 wounded in airstrikes on Yemen’s port of Hodeidah, which Israel said were a response to Houthi missile attacks. In Lebanon, authorities said at least 105 people had been killed by Israeli air strikes on Sunday.Lebanon’s Health Ministry has said more than 1,000 Lebanese have been killed and 6,000 wounded in the past two weeks, without saying how many were civilians. The government said a million people - a fifth of the population - have fled their homes.The intensifying Israeli bombardment over two weeks has killed a string of top Hezbollah officials, including its leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah.Israel has vowed to keep up the assault and says it wants to make its northern areas secure again for residents who have been forced to flee Hezbollah rocket attacks.Israeli drones hovered over Beirut for much of Sunday, with the loud blasts of new airstrikes echoing around the Lebanese capital. Displaced families spent the night on benches at Zaitunay Bay, a string of restaurants and cafes on Beirut’s waterfront.Many of Israel’s attacks have been carried out in the south of Lebanon, where the Iran-backed Hezbollah has most of its operations, or Beirut’s southern suburbs.Monday’s attack in the Kola district appeared to be the first strike within Beirut’s city limits. Syrians living in southern Lebanon who had fled Israeli bombardment had been sleeping under a bridge in the neighborhood for days, residents of the area said.The United States has urged a diplomatic resolution to the conflict in Lebanon but has also authorised its military to reinforce in the region.U.S. President Joe Biden, asked if an all-out war in the Middle East could be avoided, said “It has to be.” He said he will be talking to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. \nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nWhat animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. \nNepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) \nFrom Nebraska to New York, the Americans serve a sorry version of tea labelled chai latte—basically spiced up milk and water with a hint of tea. They really don’t do chiya well. Perhaps because they grow so little of it, with only 40 hectares spared for it in the whole of mainland US. Contrast this puny acreage for tea with humongous areas set aside for corn and soybean.The US is the largest corn producer in the world, churning out nearly 400 million metric tons last year. It is also a soybean heavyweight, growing some 114 million tons of the stuff a year. The success of these two products is a testament to the American ingenuity in agricultural innovation and mechanisation. On a recent hot August day, I was on the soybean farm of Kyle Durham in the US state of Missouri. A sixth generation farmer, Durham lives on the farm with his wife Courney and their two sons. Founded by Durham’s grandfather after the Second World War, his farm, which at this time of year was covered in green Soybean plants, stretches over 1,000 hectares.I am curious. “How many people do you employ in the planting and harvesting of soybeans?” I ask the middle-aged soy farmer with a salt and pepper goatee. “I do it all myself,” he says. I can hardly believe my ears. Back in Nepal, I start thinking, it would take at least 20 farm hands to work a field of a similar size. Durham then takes us to his sizable shed to show some of his farm equipment. The soy harvester is as big as a mini-house, capable, we are told, of planting the whole farm in around 10-15 days.“How much does this thing cost?” I ask.“Around 600,000 dollars,” he replies. The planter is of a similar size. Everything here is on an industrial scale.The US is better known as a technological goliath, birthing such world-beating tech giants as Apple and Google. Lesser known are its agriculture exploits. Yet even in agriculture, it is a model of efficiency and endless experimentation.According to the US Department of Agriculture, the total farm output in the country tripled between 1948 and 2021, even as total input use declined. The American farmers and their representative bodies work closely with local research universities to boost yield and discover more weather and pest resistant crop varieties. Even at the risk of comparing chalk and cheese, it is worth nothing that Nepal’s productivity is dismal—even by regional standards. According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, between 1960 and 2017, the annual growth rate of rice yield in Nepal was 1.14 percent—substantially less than the corresponding figures for India (2.5 percent), Bangladesh (three percent) and China (4.2 percent). In this time, the global average was 4.5 percent.No wonder Nepal is these days importing even the cereals that it once exported in abundance. Nepal used to export more food than it imported until the early 1980s. But it became a net importer from the early 1980s, and such imports really took wings after 2008.The country is still an agriculture-based economy, the sector engaging over 60 percent of its people. Yet it is also clearly not a government priority. Forget fancy equipment. Our farmers don’t even get timely fertilisers, as a result of which they are having to cut down on paddy acreage. Nepal’s agricultural woes will only get worse with climate change. Indications are that changes in precipitation patterns will affect rainfed agriculture, resulting in annual yield variability and higher production risks.Yet our government continues in its own merry, do-little way, which is why, even as the risks multiply, the implementation of vital agriculture policies remains dismal. Take the National Agricultural Policy 2004, which came to support the Agricultural Perspective Plan, a cross-sectional strategy to make Nepal self-sufficient in food. The policy was brought to boost agriculture-led rural development. To take just one example of its poor implementation, the policy discourages transformation of fertile land for non-agricultural uses, and adoption of more scientific land use. Yet after all these years the conversion of agricultural into non-agricultural land continues unabated. Our politicians and lawmakers didn’t see any political benefit in the policy’s implementation, it seems. Even the champions of the proletariat in Nepal have turned into uber-bourgeois, and there is now no political party that understands farmers. This is self-defeating. As things stand, productive agriculture is Nepal’s best shot at prosperity. But without state support, little will come out of it. The US heavily subsidises its crops and dairy products, partly as a result of the outsized political clout of American farmers. Even in India, there are large subsidies for fertilisers, as well as generous irrigation and crop insurance—not to mention a legion of hidden subsidies. By comparison, in Nepal, things like minimum support prices and input subsidies are as good as non-existent. When other countries, big and small, are offering substantial subsidies to their farmers, why have we failed to protect and promote our own farmers? Why is there such a mismatch between our status as an agricultural country and the reality on the ground? This is no trivial issue. Food insecurity is emerging as a big global challenge. Even Nepal is often affected by India’s sudden bans on export of daily commodities like sugar and grains. Earlier this year, rice prices surged in Nepal after India banned the export of non-basmati white rice. Nepalis, as a result, are having to set aside larger and larger sums from their fixed incomes just to feed themselves. Pretty much the same thing happens with many of the fruits and vegetables. There is no reason Nepali agriculture should be struggling so badly despite the country’s obvious challenges: Besides the ones mentioned above, land fragmentation, difficult terrains, high exodus of youths, and the absence of the economies of scale available to the likes of the US and India. Back home in Nepal, as I finally get to sip on some locally-grown, delectably light white tea, I cannot help but think: In a country where under 2 percent of its people are into agriculture, the American farmers are rich and wield enormous political power. In sharp contrast, in Nepal, where a solid majority of people still rely directly or indirectly on agriculture for their livelihood, the Nepali farmers are poor, and they now have next to no political power that they can use to change their lot.   \nNepali politics has begun to take more emotional swings than the ideological and political projections that guided earlier discussions and actions. Judging from the performance of some of the major characters, if not all, we can see the following.The overplayed bravado seems to be the character of some political leaders of the major parties. Though the leaders sound emotional and superbly ideological in their party-related speeches, they are torn between dreams and realities as never before. The sense of futurity and the dream plans for the country of some intelligent political leaders are mired in their narratives of conduct and misguided ambitions. Their intellectual and policy documents are few and far between. Evoking fear, emotion and threat appears to be the common style. However, it would be wrong to conclude that the entire political system and the modus operandi of all the political leaders possess this character.I would like to mention some occasions to enter the subject, which is the changing character of Nepali politics on some important scores. Political scientists and historians have been writing on this. History says Nepali political parties came into existence by choosing certain political ideologies as the guiding principles. The broad division line was between the social democratic principles and communist ideology. The political parties did lay down their programmes and principles regarding the economy’s management, the structure of political organisations, and the nature of the constitution. I remember raising slogans as a school student supporting a political party and repeating its complex economic and political programmes. People from different walks of life repeated the slogans like a mantra. The parties drew from the ideologies propounded by scholars, philosophers and leaders like Karl Marx, Mahatma Gandhi, Mao Zedong and others. We grew with the ideological foregrounding dominating the organisations of the political parties. But later, such ideological foregrounding lost its earlier attraction. The party leaders travel to different parts of the country for what they call consciousness-raising. However, the basic mode of party propaganda and schooling is dominated by oral discourses, rhetorics and interactions, not the teaching of hard-core ideologies. I understand political parties do not prioritise elaborating or explaining the ideological part, since it has lost its original attraction. What we have now is a post-ideological situation, created by the Nepali political parties, especially the communists. This becomes important, if we consider the major transformations and experiments that Nepal’s communists have made in their ideological options.Maoist leader Lokendra Bista Magar ‘Abhyas’ met me at my working table at Himalayan Java Coffee House in Thamel over a decade ago. A huge tome running 800 pages titled Nepali Communist Andolan ra Janakrantika Aitihasik Dastabejharu (2070 BS) or \"The historical documents of the Nepali Communist Movements and People's Revolution\" accompanied him. He wanted me to review the book. I tried to convince him that I was not the right person. However, Bista said, \"We want a non-partisan literary person to review this.\" His remarks struck me, and I decided to write and publish the book review in Kantipur (May 19, 2014). The book begins with the first pamphlet published after the establishment of the Nepal Communist Party on September 15, 1945, and includes documents about the breaking and coming together of different communist groups. Overall, the tome is a vast single self-review of the Nepali communists. The swings in the communist parties are noteworthy. Take the Maoist movement, the party's armed insurgency and the grand peace agreement they signed with the other seven parliamentary parties on November 21, 2006, as examples. The latest big party, organised around the so-called ideology and the name of Mao, did not put a premium on the tremendous production of ideological propaganda. However, as the bibliographies show, there is a massive body of work written about the Maoist movement, and the Maoists separately and systematically elaborated the party's ideology as a project. This is an interesting subject of study. The Maoist armed movement naturally had an impact on Nepali politics. They shunned the path after the agreement. It is significant how the political leaders, especially the communists who have carved out the history of Nepal, find the Bangladesh uprising an eloquent example to evoke fear of disruption and uprising in the country. As a senior responsible leader, this is a natural warning from Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the erstwhile prime minister. However, his other remarks do not give credence to that. Similarly, the CPN-UML, instead of uniting parties on addressing the country’s important issues, has chosen to stoke the fire by rubbing the word himsa or violence that they see as the sole character of the Maoists. But this is a mere semantic luxury to rub on the word himsa and enjoy seeing the Maoist leaders shout in opposition, promising to stall the parliamentary proceedings. Nepali Congress lives on with BP Koirala and his ideals. Koirala did not write great theoretical works; instead, he chose to write great literary works. He saw immense power in the inner dynamics of his characters' psyche; he decided to keep that separate from his politics. Koirala had a clear conscience about political matters. He made a famous declaration that he was an anarchist in literature and a socialist in politics. Other parties come with similar packages of dreams, ideologies, and disillusionments.I was asked to comment on the book launch of Prachanda: The Unknown Revolutionary (2008), written about Dahal by Anirban Roy, a Hindustan Times journalist and published by Mandala Book Point. The event was held at the Himalaya Hotel. The people invited to the dais were the then Chairman of the Constituent Assembly, Subas Chandra Nembang, Dahal’s father, Muktinath Dahal, and me. That was Dahal’s first stint as prime minister, yet he could not attend the programme. Dahal’s father signed a book for me and said, among other things, “Honesty is the greatest strength of a political leader.” Whenever I see the wavy signature of this simple and inspiring farmer, I feel that political leaders are slowly abandoning the path of honesty. \nThis article is based on the conversations I have had with students, alums, employers, HR trainers, consultants and educators about the current job market landscape and the increasingly common trend of job hopping. As an educator who has led the placement cell of a business school for seven consecutive years, I have noticed shifts in the Nepali job market dynamics. Job-hopping behaviour of younger employees, especially Generation Z, born between 1997 and 2012, and millennials, born between 1981 and 1996, is a particular concern for employers. A Gallup study found that Millennials are most likely to switch jobs, with 6 millennials out of 10 open to new opportunities, reflecting their low engagement in the workforce. This is also evident in Nepal, especially in sectors like IT, startups, banking, corporate and development. In today's gig economy, career paths for younger generations significantly differ from those of earlier generations. However, due to the lack of official data and empirical research on job hopping in the country, this piece takes an exploratory approach to understanding the phenomenon.Why do people job-hop?There are various reasons why people change jobs, such as insufficient compensation, lack of career opportunities, limited growth potential, low job satisfaction and dissatisfaction with workplace culture and toxic environment. Common complaints include issues with supervisors' communication styles, lack of mentorship and development, boredom, uninspiring work environment, misalignment with company values, rigid dress codes and ineffective communication channels like social media. Younger generations prefer their supervisors and seniors to use communication channels and platforms that align with their preferences, such as voice messages and images, to convey messages instead of lengthy written content. The younger generation values appealing modern job titles like \"lead\" and avoids workplace cultures that use traditional hierarchical titles such as \"officer\" or \"assistant,\" even for entry-level positions.These generations believe that job-hopping can accelerate career growth. They prioritise work-life balance, favouring flexible hours and remote work opportunities over higher pay. Non-financial benefits, such as two-day weekends and a relaxed office culture, are also attractive to them. Platforms like LinkedIn allow them to share career expectations, which enhances their negotiating power easily. Additionally, headhunting is prevalent, and being approached by recruiters often encourages employees to switch jobs, as it makes them feel valued and offers opportunities for better compensation or promotions. In startups and smaller firms, job security and career stagnation further drive job hopping. Nepali youths may also switch jobs to fit in with social circles, as it is sometimes seen as a trend. Long-term jobs are less appealing to these gig workers, who prefer project-based assignments and dislike hierarchical structures. They seek recognition and value performance metrics over traditional benefits like pensions. As a result, their commitment to long-term employment is often limited. In Nepal, alongside the rise of employees switching jobs domestically, experienced workers in specific sectors prefer to move abroad for better opportunities. Consequences of job hoppingFrom my frequent interactions with younger professionals, it is clear that competitive salaries are a major factor driving job switches, often without considering long-term impact. This can hinder deep skill development, as constantly seeking diverse experiences may result in inconsistent expertise.Employers often perceive frequent job changes as signs of instability, which can harm an employee's reputation. While job hopping can lead to diverse skills, it may not always result in meaningful growth, and those switching for higher positions might experience only superficial progress. Job hopping is resulting in rising employee turnover, which is affecting productivity, increasing recruitment costs and leading to the loss of institutional knowledge.Is job hopping really bad?Many Nepali employers are making concerted efforts to retain top talent by engaging employees through innovative programmes like employee development initiatives. The Employee First, Customer Second (EFCS) approach prioritises employee well-being over customer satisfaction, believing that their happiness can result in better customer service. Organisations offer study opportunities and programmes like in-house Toastmasters, which are fully funded for employees.Although job hopping may seem negative, it does not necessarily harm the economy. Recent research shows that the relationship between how long someone has worked (tenure) and their productivity forms a curve. Analysis of the workforce's tenure suggested that the positive impact of tenure on productivity becomes smaller over time. Hence, longer tenure does not always result in performance enhancement.The concept of Pareto optimality, or Pareto efficiency, is relevant in the labour market, particularly regarding job hopping, where both employees and employers can benefit. When a situation is Pareto optimal, one party cannot improve their situation without negatively impacting someone else. This principle applies to the relationship between employers and employees, especially when job changes benefit both. For employees, job changes often lead to better opportunities, such as improved pay, work-life balance, career growth, or job satisfaction. An employee may find a new position that aligns closely with their values, skills, or career goals, enhancing their situation without harming their previous employer.Employers also gain from job hopping. When an employee leaves, it allows the employer to seek candidates who may be a better fit for the role. For example, if a former employee is disengaged, their departure can lead to hiring someone more aligned with the company's objectives, resulting in a more productive and engaged workforce. This can enhance the labour market's efficiency by matching individuals to roles that suit their skills and motivations. As both parties find better alignments—employers with more capable workers and employees with more fitting roles—the dynamic can lead to a Pareto optimal outcome, optimising human resources without disadvantage. However, not every job change achieves Pareto efficiency. Even in cases where a job move proves advantageous for the employee, employers may bear expenses associated with the recruitment, employment and training of new staff members. This could result in a short-term disadvantage for the company. An employee may occasionally depart with important institutional knowledge that the employer finds difficult to replace, which could put the employer in a worse situation. Nepali employers need to carefully assess the advantages and disadvantages of this growing trend and be better prepared to manage it effectively. \nFrom 1977 to 2007, in the process of expanding the Shuklaphanta Wildlife Reserve, now a national park in Sudurpaschim Province, thousands of families were displaced. The Ministry of Forest and Environment rehabilitated 5,200 families in camps inside the park, quite close to the wildlife. Citing safety concerns, over the past 22 years, hundreds of families have sought a way out of the national park. Yet they don’t know where to go or what to do next. Shuklaphanta is an example of a recurring national problem. Every year, disasters, both natural and manmade, leave thousands of Nepali families without proper shelters. Seldom has the state taken an initiative for their quick and proper rehabilitation. What’s at stake is the security and well-being of the displaced people. Temporary shelters and settlement areas are not as protective as permanent ones, leaving those displaced from Shuklaphanta vulnerable to the attacks of wild animals and other natural calamities. Dealing with wild animals in the national park has become a daily struggle. And their settlement in the conservation area has also proved detrimental to wildlife. Following last year’s Jajarkot earthquake, hundreds of families had to put up in temporary huts. Come monsoon, things only got worse, holed up as they were in their leaky tents. Lest we forget, during winter, many earthquake victims died due to cold. Pretty much the same could now be true in the case of those displaced by the wildlife reserve. Over the years, multiple judicial commissions—33 in total—have been formed in Sudurpaschim province to address the Shuklaphanta rehabilitation issue. Yet none has done anything substantive other than count the number of displaced families—1,480 of them. But a coordinator for the displaced families claims the number is 2,473, accusing the commission of deliberately downplaying the number of the displaced. Similar inefficiencies plague disaster rehabilitation efforts across the country. Discrepancies in government records and actual numbers often result in relief materials either failing to reach the needy or piling up unused. As concerning is the disappearance of funds meant for rehabilitation programmes. Even after the 2015 earthquake, many donor agencies were concerned that corruption would hamper rebuilding—and it did. The 30th commission in Shuklaphanta proposed to provide each displaced family with 0.338 hectares of land or Rs6 million in compensation. But that recommendation was never seriously considered. As a result, the victims have long lost faith in these commissions. It is thus vital that any new initiative be taken only after gaining the victims’ trust. Rehabilitation of course isn’t something that can be done in haste. It takes time and thought-out measures. Yet proper rehabilitation is seldom the state’s priority, as those in the government prefer to try out much easier temporary fixes rather than rigorously work on the same issue for months or even years on end. The displaced individuals, who are already mentally and physically traumatised, shouldn’t have to suffer more. Each and every Nepali has the constitutional right to live with dignity and it is the state’s responsibility to ensure the same. Really, a government that is incapable of looking after its weak and vulnerable people does not deserve to be called democratic.  \nEvery year, on the eve of Dashain, Tihar and Chhath, the triumvirate of Nepal’s biggest festivals, market prices shoot up, shadowing the festive mood. This year too, the prices of essential goods such as rice, edible oil, legumes and lentils are already soaring. To make matters worse, both long-range buses and airlines hike ticket prices, making the journey home a financial burden for many. Goods prices are really not consumer-friendly. Even the supposedly low-cost goods from China are now out of reach of many families. Let us not even get started on the price of gold, which only the super-rich can now afford. While it is natural for international trends to influence market prices, the bigger problem in Nepal are opportunistic traders and middlemen who are freely fleecing consumers in the absence of proper market supervision. Take the recent price hike in edible oil. When India, Nepal’s all-important trade partner, increased the basic import tax on crude and edible oils by 25 percent, Nepali importers seized on the opportunity to increase the price of edible oil, even when the government of Nepal had not increased its import taxes on oil. As a result, sunflower oil, which was Rs190 a litre last week, is now being sold at Rs210 a litre; mustard oil, which was going at Rs350 a litre, now costs Rs370 for the same amount. Rice prices have also increased by an average of Rs100kg (for a 25 kg bag). In the next few weeks, the prices could get steeper still. In response, the government has started operating fair-priced shops across the country to help people tide over festive times. However, such festival-time intervention will not be enough to stop unscrupulous businesses from arbitrarily setting prices. Only if there is periodic monitoring of the market will the effort seem credible and businesses take it seriously. Moreover, according to consumer rights activists, just inspecting retail markets is not enough. To prevent unscrupulous trade, the warehouses of larger importers and traders where goods are stocked for supply must also come under regular inspections.Then there is the matter of added travel costs. Domestic flight fares rise due to increased demand during festivals. For instance, the usual one-way airfare for Kathmandu-Dhangadhi is Rs7,900, but travellers will have to pay Rs13,300 between October 10-12 this year. Those who book tickets ahead of time get to travel on the standard fare, but those in emergencies are bound to suffer. Travel via the roads is another concern during festivals as the transport management department, which has issued directives for safe and comfortable travel, has refused to increase the number of passenger buses. This has allowed the current bus operators to overcharge passengers. Ease of travel is a basic right and it cannot be solely left to the logic of supply and demand, especially during the festive times when all people long to be with their loved ones. Several studies, including one by the National Consumer Forum, a consumer rights body, reckon Nepal’s market is comparably more expensive than markets of similar economies. Festive time or not, only year-round market monitoring, intervention and penalties for scrupulous operators can ease the growing financial burden on people.  \nOn Sunday, Nepal’s Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli met his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. Although there was little in terms of outcomes, it was nonetheless an important meeting. Top Indian leaders and bureaucrats have been reluctant to engage with Oli following his 2020 initiative to insert into the Nepali national charter a map of Nepal incorporating Kalapani. The Indians were also upset, unsurprisingly, when Oli, during his previous stint as prime minister, mocked the official Indian emblem, saying it represented the adage ‘Singhamev Jayate’ (power alone triumphs) rather than ‘Satyamev Jayate’ (truth alone triumphs). Separately, the CPN-UML chief riled the BJP establishment when he baselessly claimed that Lord Ram was born in Nepal’s Thori rather than India’s Ayodhya. So India has good reasons not to trust Oli. Yet the way it was consistently rebuffing Oli’s recent overtures for a bilateral meeting with Modi was unbecoming too. The Indians may not particularly like Oli, ‘China’s man’ in the reckoning of many Indian analysts. Yet they also cannot refuse to engage with the elected leader of a traditionally close partner country. Given the closeness of their relationship, Nepal and India have no option but to continue to engage at all levels, at all times. For instance, Sunday’s meeting may not have led to anything more substantive than Modi’s assurance that he will soon visit Nepal. But just the fact that the two leaders met is loaded with symbolism. India, which claims undisputed leadership of South Asia, cannot fulfil that role by sidelining the democratically elected leaders of its neighbouring countries. Such an approach will also be a mockery of Modi’s Neighbourhood First policy. It is vital for heads of government to talk as that sends a positive message down the official chain of command, opening up many new avenues of cooperation. For Oli, the meeting was also a matter of optics. Just like Modi likes to buttress his image at home by presenting himself as a rock star in his mass rallies abroad, Nepali leaders do so through their engagements with top world leaders, particularly those of India and China. Prime Minister Oli will now no doubt play up his meeting with Modi, while trying to rubbish the claim that India somehow wants to see him gone soon.Whatever the case, it is wonderful that the Nepali and Indian prime ministers are talking. This time, the Nepali side could not discuss its preferred issues like Kalapani and Eminent Persons' Group (EPG). But these issues can be brought up at different bilateral mechanisms between the two countries that the two prime ministers agreed to revive on Sunday. In the larger scheme of things, India’s leadership of the South Asian region has again come under scrutiny following the ignominious fall of one of its darlings, Sheikh Hasina of Bangladesh. The lesson for New Delhi is clear enough: Stop trying to pick favourites in the neighbourhood. That will only backfire in the long run. A better course of action for India would be to continue to engage all democratic constituencies in the region and let the democratic process take its own natural course—be it in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka or Nepal. On the part of Nepali leaders, they must forswear their dual nature whereby they become the most ardent anti-India critics, only to later try to cosy up to New Delhi when it is politically expedient for them to do so.  \nNepal’s economy that has been facing one after another setbacks since the 2015 earthquake has been struggling to bounce back. Last week, two international agencies—the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB)—announced that Nepal’s economy was poised to improve in the upcoming fiscal year. In this context, the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Nara Bahadur Thapa, former executive director of the research department of Nepal Rastra Bank, to discuss the current state of the national economy. The ADB, in its report last week, anticipated Nepal’s economy to grow by 4.9 percent this fiscal. A few days earlier, a visiting IMF team also painted an improving picture of Nepal’s economy. How do you see these projections?Nepal’s economic growth in the past 2-3 years has remained below 5 percent. But successive governments in their fiscal budgets have been setting the target of 6 to 7 percent growth. Also, the budget this year has aimed for 6 percent growth. In the meantime, two donor agencies have painted an improving picture of our economy. The ADB has anticipated 4.9 percent growth. Also, the IMF’s team that visited Nepal on a fact finding mission has projected better prospects. They expected better yield from the agriculture sector as Nepal is witnessing more rains. Last year, the growth of agriculture was 3 percent. Now they expect the sector may grow by 3.5 to 4 percent and that may lift overall growth. They have cited improvement in tourism and increased energy export as other bases. Based on these grounds, the ADB has projected 4.9 percent economic growth. But even the target of 5 percent growth looks ambitious if you analyse economic data available as of now and the steps taken by government agencies. We have witnessed more rain but that doesn’t always do us good. More rain in the late monsoon often damages paddy at the time of harvest. Second, the heavy monsoon has caused huge losses in our infrastructure such as roads and bridges that are vital to keep the daily lives and trade running. This may impact potential economic growth as some vital highways and roads have been badly damaged. These factors may pose a challenge in achieving the targets set by the government and donor agencies. Another important factor is that the ratio of capital formation to GDP [gross domestic product] is consistently decreasing. It was 33.8 in the fiscal year 2018-19, it decreased to 30.5 in 2019-20, to 29.3 in 2020-21, 29.0 in 2021-22, 25.1 in 2022-23 and 24.5 in 2023-24. How can we expect economic growth when capital formation keeps decreasing. We can’t achieve 6 percent growth without first improving the situation of capital formation. Capital formation in the private sector is on a decline and the government hasn’t been able to boost it. On the other hand, capital expenditure was lower in the past fiscal year in comparison to the previous fiscal. There is no strong sign of increasing capital formation even in the coming year. This is because the government has failed to collect revenue as per its own target. The revenue collection ratio is falling. It has come down to 18 percent of GDP, from 22 percent not so long ago. With this, the government’s funding capacity is continuously declining. It has failed even to fulfil its own duties. For instance, it hasn’t been able to pay health insurance bills and or the contractors. Similarly, credit offtake from private banks to the private sector has not increased from 6 percent. It used to be around 15-16 percent. Also, no substantive initiatives have been taken to improve productivity. For this, government agencies have to cut red tape. The private sector isn’t optimistic. We are talking a lot but not working seriously to lay a strong ground for growth.What are the signs that private investors are pessimistic?There is enough liquidity in the banks, and the interest rate is decreasing, but the private sector is not borrowing. Bankers say there is no demand from the sector. This indicates pessimism. None of the big business houses have launched any big projects in recent times. The government talks a lot about the energy sector but it is not doing power purchase agreements (PPAs) with hydropower project developers. We aren’t doing enough to realise the goal of exporting 10,000MW electricity to India. This shows no serious effort is being made to initiate reforms. The capital market has required some urgent reforms. But the government hasn’t appointed office bearers in the regulatory body for the past seven months. The government hasn’t given permission to issue IPOs and FPOs. Hence, the government is keeping two important sectors—energy and capital market—on hold. All these trends and activities suggest it will be a challenge to achieve even moderate economic growth.You pointed to the policy hurdles but the multilateral agencies have hailed the government for policy reforms. The IMF in its statement has welcomed recent amendments to various laws and the ADB has welcomed “the cautiously accommodative monetary policy”. Don’t these statements reflect reality?While making their positions public, the international agencies follow certain norms and criteria. First, they take macro pictures such as the government’s commitments. They take the pledges made by the government in the investment summit seriously. They think the commitments will be implemented. Second, they don’t want to irk the host country by presenting a bleak picture because they are diplomats. They point out possible pitfalls during bilateral and table talks but present themselves diplomatically while making their official statements public.Remittance, tourism and energy export are taken as major bases for economic growth but all three depend on external factors. How reliable can the projection be?Without trading and increasing exports, we can’t progress economically. We need to export to increase production and create jobs. Export is an engine of economic growth. Anyhow, we must increase exports. About your query, the government should tackle such things by strengthening relations with the countries concerned and devise policies and strategies accordingly.Our economy is increasingly dependent on remittance. How risky is it in the long run?Remittance has become a boon for our economy. It has played a tremendous role in poverty reduction. The first Nepal Living Standard Survey (NLSS) conducted by the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS)—now the National Statistics Office—in 1995-96 showed 42 percent Nepali population living below the poverty line. The latest [fourth] living standard survey has shown the poverty level at 20 percent. It wouldn’t be possible without remittance. Therefore, we can’t undermine the role of remittance in this social transformation. Were not the government’s plans and policies responsible for this achievement?The government role would not have been enough. What government policies have created jobs in Nepal? Are there any schemes worth mentioning? The industrialisation hasn’t increased. It is the industrial sector that creates jobs but the share of the manufacturing sector has come down to 4.87 percent in total GDP. Some years ago, it was nearly 9-10 percent. It shows our economy is being deindustrialised. How can we reduce poverty without providing jobs to the youths? Thus, foreign employment played a vital role in poverty reduction. Second is the role of remittance in maintaining foreign exchange reserves, which is essential to buy things from abroad. We have sufficient foreign exchange reserves because of remittance.Information Technology is now projected as a promising sector in creating jobs and transforming Nepal’s economy. How realistic is this expectation?Four fields can be taken as promising sectors in Nepal—agriculture, tourism, IT and hydropower. The IT sector certainly has a bright future. As our country is land-locked, we have additional challenges in merchandise exports and we can’t be competitive. The IT sector won’t have that barrier so it can be competitive in the international market. But for that the government has to formulate IT-friendly policies. For instance, if a Kathmandu-based Nepali firm wants to sell services in the US, Europe or any other international market, they need liaison offices in those countries. Otherwise, they can’t be competitive and grow. But the government doesn’t provide foreign exchange for them to expand their business abroad.Without this policy reform, Nepalis can’t compete with IT companies from other countries. Similarly, foreign companies need to come and work here so that Nepali youths can learn from them. Foreign banks came to Nepal and Nepali bankers learned. Now Nepali banks are doing good. But our policies aren’t favourable for foreigners interested in setting up IT firms. Also, well-trained IT workers are in shortage. We are progressing but we have to put in extra effort to make transformative changes in this sector.The cooperatives’ scam has emerged as a serious issue. What impact may it cause in the national economy if it’s not resolved soon?The cooperative sector played a vital role in creating financial inclusion in our economy by making 7.3 million people its members. Those who couldn’t do their regular transactions with banks were engaged with cooperatives. If that sector collapses, our state of financial inclusion will decline too. Second, they were major financiers for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME). Cooperatives are directly linked to entrepreneurship through MSMEs. They played a role in making interest rates of banks more competitive as well as banks and financial institutions were under pressure by the interest rates offered by cooperatives. Now they won’t feel the pressure.In this context, many people may resort to informal transactions. According to the 16th periodic plan, nearly 50 percent of Nepal’s economy is informal. We are under pressure to reduce the portion of the informal economy. But the crisis in the cooperative sector may increase the informal economy as those who were involved in cooperatives, which is a formal sector, are likely to do informal transactions with traders or other individuals.Cooperatives are not well regulated and there are anomalies but they are registered in a government agency, pay taxes, have offices and a record system. They brought people in far-flung villages under a formal channel. If the depositors resort to individual transactions, their money will be unsafe. The constitution accepted them as one of the three pillars—along with the government and the private sector—of the country’s economy. The sector expanded its network where there were no economic activities from the government and private sectors. For instance, the government was providing certain services such as distributing fertilisers, crop seeds, sugar through cooperatives. People will now be deprived of these services. Also, the commercial banks might face complications due to the domino effect of the cooperative scam. For instance, if the government seizes the land put up by a cooperative as a collateral in a bank and sells it to return the deposits, the bank might be in trouble.It is also said that cooperatives were becoming platforms for money laundering. How serious was the problem?Cooperatives didn’t seek a source of money from the depositors while accepting big deposits. They weren’t affiliated to the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of the central bank and the Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT). Therefore, there is a problem of money laundering. It can be resolved when they get affiliated with the FIU.What initiatives should be taken to address the problems seen in the cooperative sector?A powerful regulatory authority should be established without delay. The authority should work as a dedicated agency to clear the mess. Then, AML/CFT provisions should be implemented, a credit information centre should be set up and a debt recovery tribunal formed, and deposits guaranteed. The concept of self-regulation isn’t enough. These financial infrastructures are essential. \nThe parliamentary special probe committee formed to investigate cooperatives scam submitted its report last week. The government has already started implementing the report. In this context, Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with the committee chair Surya Thapa for more insights on the probe’s findings and the anomalies in the cooperative sector they saw during the investigation.After your committee submitted the report on cooperatives scam, people have interpreted its findings in different ways. Why the confusion?Our committee prepared, finalised and endorsed the report unanimously. No member registered any dissent. This is an important point. However, people have interpreted its findings a bit differently. The supporters of [Rastriya Swatantra Party chair] Rabi Lamichhane have tried to make it appear like the report has given him a clean chit. They have selectively taken a certain portion of the report which states that Lamichhane’s involvement couldn’t be formally established in the process of transferring funds from cooperatives to the Gorkha Media Network. But a huge amount of money has been provided to the Gorkha Media Network from various cooperatives against the Cooperative Act 2017, which prohibits investment of cooperative deposits to any company. It is seen that Lamichhane is directly involved in spending the funds collected from the cooperatives. Based on that, we have found chair of the media company Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai, the then managing director Rabi Lamichhane, directors Chhabilal Joshi and Kumar Ramtel directly responsible in the misuse of cooperative funds and have asked the government to take action against them as per the existing laws. The aforementioned two aspects are inextricably linked. We didn’t find any evidence of transfer of cooperative funds to Lamichhane’s personal bank account. It is sent to the bank account of the Gorkha Media Network. The KYC form of the Global IME Bank shows that Lamichhane is one of the three holders of the joint account. Any one of the three can issue cheques from the account. The funds invested as loan in the Gorkha Media Network have been transferred to the joint bank account, from where Lamichhane has released money by signing cheques. This is how Lamichhane is directly involved in embezzlement of the cooperative funds. Many argue that as per the cooperative law only those who release money from the cooperatives are held responsible but not those who spend it after it is received at the company. Is that the case?The Cooperative Act 2017 prohibits releasing any loan to a company. But it is sent to the company, where Lamichhane is an owner with 15 percent share and a managing director. And, the money is misused there. An informal statement of GB Rai shows Rs1.20 billion of cooperative deposits has been invested in the media company while our financial analysis shows the amount is Rs654 million. Evidence shows Rs220 million has been directly sent to the media company’s bank account. Depositors have been deprived of their money. Other staff working at the company aren’t responsible but the owners are. They could be charged with cooperative fraud under the Cooperative Act, fraud and duping under the National Penal Code, organised crime cases under the Organised Crime Prevention Act, and money laundering cases under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. Some individuals involved with various cooperatives including Roshni Gurung of a Butwal-based cooperative told the committee that they deposited millions of rupees in the bank account of a person named Rabi Lamichhane. Kumar Ramtel said the person named Rabi Lamichhane is none other than the Rastriya Swatantra Party chair. Still, the committee couldn’t establish the link. What is the complication?The flow of the money shows the connection but documents to link the transactions are not available. We didn’t find documents with Lamichhane’s signatures and fingerprints that needed to be submitted to get a loan. All the seven cooperatives run by GB Rai were releasing loans without following due procedure. But we have successfully traced the flow of the money. The loan amount created in the name of Rabi Lamichhane in Butwal and deposited by Roshni Gurung had reached the Gorkha Media Network’s bank account which was jointly operated by GB Rai, Rabi Lamichhane and Chhabilal Joshi. This is an established fact. The committee didn’t find any document showing the flow of cooperative money to his personal account. But that alone is insufficient to give him a clean chit as a huge sum has been sent to the media company’s bank account jointly run by three people including Lamichhane. Another sum from the Supreme Cooperative has been deposited to the bank account of Gorkha Media Network. The bank voucher shows Roshni Gurung/Rabi Lamichhane as depositors. The amount also goes to the same joint account.Now the government has forwarded the report to the investigation agencies. Do you think the agencies can unearth the missing documents?Our committee worked in a different way to regular House committees. We followed methods of investigation just like the police investigation agencies and government’s prosecution agencies do. We recorded the suspects’ statements, took their fingerprints, and got the signatures to authenticate their statements. I believe this is a new practice by a Nepali parliamentary committee. Sufficient evidence has already been gathered in the past as well. While carrying out this task and preparing the 1,124-page document, we have followed the norms and procedures of an investigation body.During the interrogation, many suspects told the committee that they knew nothing and shifted the responsibility to GB Rai, who is on the run. Those from seven cooperatives–Hamro Nayakrishi Multipurpose Cooperatives; Swarnalaxmi; Supreme; Suryadarshan; Sahara; Samanata and Sano Paila and the officials from Gorkha Media Network gave such answers. Their common answer is, “I don’t know about this, GB Rai does.” Many of them might have been trying to evade their responsibility by blaming Rai. The government has failed to produce Rai. Won’t this investigation be incomplete in his absence?Based on its facts and evidence, the investigation report is complete. Yes, 29 suspects including GB Rai are at large. They are believed to be staying abroad. Their statements have not been recorded. But that doesn’t make the investigation incomplete. We have accessed the database of Gorkha Media Network and other cooperative organisations, collected important documents and analysed them. There is no confusion about the money embezzled in the scam. We have determined a total of Rs2.58 billion from various cooperatives has been misused by investing in several organisations including the Gorkha Media Network, Nature Nest, Nature Herbs, Gorkha Group of Investment, Gorkha Ayurved Company—49 people were responsible for these investments, including GB Rai. Of that, Rs654 million has been invested in Gorkha Media Network. A total of Rs8 billion has been embezzled in the seven cooperatives where Rai is involved. So the investigation is complete. During the interrogation, some office bearers of cooperatives claimed they had no role in the transactions as they were dummy officials and GB Rai and some individuals Rai trusted did everything. How convincing is that?The practice of creating dummy officials, fake documents, false marriages and divorces etcetera is rampant in the cooperative sector. In the seven cooperatives GB Rai is at the centre. He has at least one key person in each of these seven cooperatives as chair or manager and carries out everything through them. In some of them, the chairpersons know nothing. The cooperatives don’t follow any norms, rules and regulations of cooperatives. They work just on the basis of orders they get from Rai or his trusted individuals over the phone. Rai gets advice from a California-based individual named Gyan Bahadur Bamjan. The Cooperative Act prohibits an individual from being a member of more than one cooperative but Rai is involved in at least seven cooperatives as a chair, secretary, vice-chair or patron.The government has decided to implement the report. How should the state agencies work to bring good results?The government should immediately initiate action against four persons—Rabi Lamichhane, GB Rai, Chhabilal Joshi and Kumar Ramtel—as the report has found them responsible for misusing cooperative funds. We have also determined the roles and responsibilities of around 1,000 individuals who were chair, vice-chairs, secretaries, treasurers, account chiefs or others who in decision making roles in 40 cooperatives we were tasked to investigate. They should be brought under investigation and their properties should be seized so as to create an environment to return the depositors’ money.Different arrangements need to be made about those who are in judicial custody. They should be released, their all documents including passports seized and they should be kept under surveillance and allowed to take initiatives to return the depositors’ money. The government, while unveiling the fiscal budget, had announced to take initiatives to return deposits upto Rs500,000 by keeping cooperatives’ assets as collateral. This process should be expedited. Likewise, the government should set up an all-powerful regulatory authority. At present, all the 753 local governments, seven provincial governments and the federal government have the regulatory role. That is pointless. Now a strong dedicated regulatory authority should be formed. The Crisis-ridden Cooperatives Management Committee is there but it should be made more effective by giving it greater executive powers. When a cooperative is in crisis, the regulatory body should take over its management and fix the crisis just like Nepal Rastra Bank does in the banking sector.What patterns of anomalies did you find in the cooperatives?The fundamental idea of a cooperative is to run by its own members based on self-regulation. But a few board members were found to be using all the authority and misusing the funds while members were unaware about the affairs in the organisations. The board members use most of the resources for their relatives and other closed ones. Annual meetings are organised as picnics and wedding parties. In some cases, annual meetings are fake, audit reports, auditors and signatures, all are fake.In the course of preparing the committee report, I have coined terms like ‘cooperative divorce’ and ‘cooperative marriage’. Divorce and marriage documents are prepared based on the fortune of the cooperatives. There was misappropriation of Rs120 million in a cooperative, where Jyoti Gurung was manager, in 2075 BS. Dhan Raj Gurung, who is Nepali Congress Vice-president, divorced his wife Jyoti in 2076 BS. But, in 2077, Dhan Raj presented himself as a guarantor of a loan to Jyoti. Again in 2080, both of them jointly paid back a loan of Rs9.1 million. This is a bit of a trend in the cooperative sector.Do you think we need to reconsider the basic idea of cooperatives as self-regulated organisations?In the report, we haven’t questioned its principle, need and importance. Cooperative sector is vital for our economy. But the concept of self-regulation as stated in the Cooperative Act 2017 has failed. Now, this sector should be overseen by a strong regulatory body. Still, the idea of self-regulation can be given continuity as the members should be allowed to run the cooperatives on their own but their activities should be strictly regulated by a powerful authority. Moreover, the cooperatives that do big transactions should be regulated by the central bank.Why did the present regulatory bodies fail?There were over 50 lawmakers who proudly identified themselves as office bearers of certain cooperatives. They over-emphasised self-regulation and undermined the role of regulatory bodies. Individuals like GB Rai and other fraudsters benefited from that. Therefore, we recommended stringent laws and a stronger regulatory authority. \nNepal is marking its ninth Constitution Day on Thursday. The country’s two largest parties—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—formed a coalition government a month ago with a commitment to reviewing and amending the constitution. In this context, Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal and Binod Ghimire sat down with constitutional expert Purna Man Shakya to discuss the good and bad aspects of the constitution amendment process.The Congress and the UML have floated a proposal to amend the constitution. Is the time ripe to make changes in our statute?Generally, constitutions are reviewed after around a decade of their implementation. So, we have come to the stage of reviewing whether our constitution has functioned properly. However, the sudden announcement of the amendment is premature, as this is a serious business. In our case, the constitution can’t be amended just based on the interest of one or two parties. It requires a national consensus. There should be an understanding among the political parties represented in Parliament. And, a sort of consensus even among the people’s level is important as there was huge public involvement in making this constitution. Sentiment of various communities must be respected while making any changes in the national charter. What can be the modality of seeking consensus at the people’s level? Should a draft be prepared and opened up for debate?While making changes in the constitution, some issues might be technical and not of interest to common people. But if any changes are made in policy issues that can alter our country’s structural dynamics, the concerned communities must be consulted. Just the present strength of the political parties represented in Parliament is no guarantee that they truly represent people. For instance, the Maoists emerged as the largest party through the election in 2008. But it has been shrunk to a distant third in the House. However, we can’t conclude from this that the people have discarded the party’s agenda. The Maoists might have been discredited due to their activities and failure in delivery but people might still favour the agenda they once championed. Similar is the case with other parties. Therefore, we have to consider broader consensus both in Parliament as well as the people’s level.How challenging is it to enter the constitution amendment process?Any amendment calls for a two-thirds majority in the House of Representatives as well as the National Assembly in the federal parliament. If an issue is linked to provincial authority, it should be endorsed by the majority [four] of seven provinces. So, this is not easy. Therefore, the parties should tread carefully.You mentioned earlier that constitution amendments without a review process is not a right step. Could you elaborate?The right way is to first have broad understanding among the top leaders of political forces on the issues and then constitute a panel of experts to conduct a comprehensive study on that. Such studies are conducted through two methods—doctrinal and non-doctrinal. The doctrinal method analyses related literature and principles on theoretical approach while the non-doctrinal method studies the public sentiments and opinions through surveys and interactions, and comes up with certain methodologies with the help of subject experts. Through such study, the experts identify the issues and recommend the ways to the politicians. This is the right process.There are also arguments that reviewing the constitution without even bringing it into full-fledged implementation is wrong. Based on the practice during these years, we have concluded that certain provisions didn’t work properly. It is true that we are talking about making changes in the constitution without even implementing certain provisions. First we have to give the system an opportunity to work in a full-fledged way. Then, we can evaluate whether it worked. Any move to dissolve the system without properly implementing it will create divisions and invite another conflict. A question that is often asked: Is there a problem with our constitution or with our politicians? People can change the constitution but the constitution can’t change the people. Therefore, a constitution should be developed also on the basis of the nature of people in the country who use it. If our political parties and the politicians had reformed themselves, we might not have had to discuss constitutional changes time and again. We should have made the system strong for more effective checks and balances and made leaders and officials more accountable. The ruling parties reason that the constitution amendment became necessary to ensure political stability.When a federal government is changed, its aftershocks are immediately seen in all seven provincial governments. It directly impacts development and other activities across the country. It’s a flaw in our party system but we have to find a solution in the system. We see people raising voices for two things—stability and retirement of old politicians. As Nepali politicians never retire voluntarily, we have to address it through the system. Direct election of executive head can be one way to address this problem. People have found local governments more effective than federal and provincial governments. It is because chiefs and representatives of local governments are directly elected and they can serve the full five-year term.Once people are given the right to elect heads of government, they won’t elect old faces such as KP Oli, Sher Bahadur Deuba and Prachanda [Pushpa Kamal Dahal], who have been tested multiple times. It will serve two purposes—first, it gives stability and second, it allows popular leaders to emerge in place of the old ones. The old leaders have maintained control over national politics through their huge party organisations. But when people directly elect presidents and chief ministers their grip over party organisations can’t be decisive in national politics. For that we have to amend the constitution.However, again, an expert team needs to thoroughly study the pros and cons of such changes. But what I can say based on the general study of public perception is that we can first go for direct election of executive heads at the provincial level. In the next phase we can go for direct presidential election at the federal level.What went wrong in the practice of the three-tier federal system?While adopting federalism, the basic idea was to allow the local governments to oversee local matters while the provincial governments would handle wide ranges of issues related to agriculture, industry, forest, education and health, etcetera. If the two sub-national governments handle these things, people don’t need to come to the centre seeking solutions to their problems. In such a scenario, the federal government can focus on important affairs such as foreign relations, defence, telecommunication, currency, national infrastructure projects and inter-provincial affairs. Such division of powers would automatically create specialisation in the respective governments.But the federal system is not implemented as per that spirit. Provinces aren’t allowed to exercise their rights. People are still travelling to Kathmandu all the way from remote districts even for basic things. The constitution has mandated the provinces to maintain law and order in their respective provinces but the federal government hasn’t allowed them to have their own police forces. Provinces without police have become like administrative units. The centre has a huge bureaucracy in Kathmandu. It is high time that the centre delegates authority to provinces as per the constitutional spirit. Federal lawmakers have huge interest in local development activities because it is directly related to their election. They don’t want to lose this influence. The interest of federal lawmakers however contradicts with the constitution.There is also a belief that the local level has authority in areas where they can’t work effectively, for instance they are mandated to oversee the education system up to grade 12 while provinces don’t have much role. Do you think such jurisdictional matters need to be reviewed and provinces should be given more authority?That’s right. First of all, we should be clear that there is no point in adopting a federal system if we don’t want provinces because we had central and local levels even in the past. Provincial layer is an integral part of federalism. So, we have to think about transferring certain rights from local to provincial level because the local units don’t have expertise to oversee education up to grade 12 on their own. Our local units are traditionally trained in local development activities. But now they are entrusted with the responsibility of not only overseeing education and health issues but also with legislative and judicial functions. They haven’t been able to play that role. We should think about transferring some roles from local to provincial levels. Likewise, the centre should be ready to allow the provinces to exercise their rights bestowed by the constitution. It is time to strengthen the provinces.You said direct election of executive heads in provinces could end instability at the provincial level. But what if a popular leader got elected chief minister but other political parties won majority seats in the provincial assemblies? In such a situation, the rival parties may not help the chief minister pass a budget or policies from the assembly.Yes, there are strengths and weaknesses of all systems. Such problems can be resolved because we see similar situations in other countries as well. Parties can’t prolong the deadlock in the House because they will be blamed for the impasse. One basis is that our local units are doing well under executive heads. So, we can practise it for a decade in the provinces and then apply it to the federal level based on that experience.Many forces and groups that aren’t happy with the present constitution, which was basically a compromise document. Once the constitution amendment process is open, they are certain to revive their demands. Will the situation be manageable?If the rights of historically marginalised communities are curtailed, they will certainly retaliate. If you try to go against the federal republic system and policy of inclusion, it may invite new conflicts. The proportional representation system is not a problem. Leaders made it unpopular by misusing it. We should find solutions to stop its misuse. We shouldn’t forget that this constitution is not only a constitution but also a key document of our peace process. This is not perfect but it was essential to end the conflict. Many say that while making a document of compromise, our constitution hasn’t followed the principles of constitutionalism. For instance, the hearing system is something unusual in a parliamentary system. As a constitutional expert, do you think we should also think about fixing such deviations?You are right. When we couldn’t change the people, we tried to add additional features as a measure to check the wrongdoings. Our leaders make appointments in key constitutional bodies guided by their personal and partisan interests. We copied the hearing practice from the presidential system with a view to check the leaders’ arbitrary appointments. It hasn’t been that effective. Therefore, we have proposed to give continuity to the hearing for political appointments but not in the appointments of judges because lawmakers don’t have the expertise to examine judges’ competence. Since lawmakers are mainly guided by the party’s whip and top leaders’ instructions, it rather increases political interference even in the judiciary. We have thus proposed to stop the hearing process for judges’ appointments.Many say that the judiciary hasn’t been federalized even though all other sectors have been restructured as per the three-tier federal system. Why this exception for the judiciary?Oh, you dragged me to a sensitive topic. One thing we shouldn’t forget is that we adopted a federal system not to unify small countries. We were already a united country. We adopted it to better manage our social diversity by involving all the communities in the governing system. We at the same time have to safeguard the country from disintegration. Judiciary, the national army and Nepali language are our institutional arrangements that can play a unifying role. Therefore, we didn’t make much changes in these three aspects.Some instances show that Nepal’s federalism might have been a bit more effective had the judiciary worked proactively. For instance, the court hasn’t decided even the cases filed by provinces years ago. What do you think about the judiciary’s role in this connection?Yes, those cases are still undecided. In the Constituent Assembly, the Maoist party had registered a proposal to form a separate constitutional court. The justices who were leading the judiciary at the time opposed the idea. It was later rejected. Then the idea to have a separate constitutional bench was included as a compromise deal. But it has failed to work effectively. It failed to decide election-related disputes. We have to review its jurisdiction. They have decided certain cases when there is public pressure. For instance they decided cases like House dissolution because there was constant public scrutiny. But they haven’t shown any interest in other important cases where constitutional interpretation is needed. Of late, a strong opinion is being built in favour of forming a separate constitutional court. These issues are being discussed seriously. This issue may emerge if the constitution amendment process begins.What we can infer from your analysis is that the constitution amendment process is not that easy. What are the basic things that should be and can be done in the constitution amendment at this stage?First, we should change the form of governance at the provincial level and go for a directly elected executive head. With this there will be no change in government in provinces after changes at the centre. The governments in provinces can work for five years with certainty. Second, we can transfer the powers that the local units have failed to exercise to provinces. And, the centre should allow the provinces to exercise the concurrent rights. By doing this the centre can reduce the overwhelming burden on it. While the provinces can play an implementing role, the federation can play a supervisory role. These things need to be fixed. We need some amendments to the constitution and some new laws for this. \nNepal has often earned global recognition for its progressive policies and inclusive stance on LGBTQIA+ rights. But do the global accolades Nepal has earned in terms of its progressiveness reflect the actual experiences of queer people here? The Post’s Aarati Ray sat down with Manisha Dhakal, executive director of the Blue Diamond Society and a leading advocate for LGBTQIA+ rights in South Asia for over 23 years.Nepal is often hailed for its progressive stance on queer rights, both in South Asia and globally. With over two decades of queer rights advocacy, how accurate do you find this portrayal?Many activists and commentators do describe Nepal as being progressive on queer rights. While this is partly true, especially when we consider the legal frameworks, the reality at the grassroots is quite different. On the one hand, Nepal’s constitution recognises LGBTQIA+ identities. Articles 12 and 18 mandate that “gender identity” be acknowledged on citizenship certificates, while Article 42 promises affirmative action and participation in government for sexual and gender minorities. Court decisions in Nepal, too, have been favourable for LGBTQIA+ rights, and unlike many former British colonies with Section 377-type laws that criminalise queer communities, Nepal has no such legal barriers. So, indeed, there are opportunities for activism, and progress has been made, particularly in terms of legal recognition. But, again, the rights enshrined in the constitution and affirmed by the courts have not been realised at the grassroots level. We are stuck with a limited focus, primarily on citizenship. The state claims that we’ve been given the right to identity and legal recognition, but even this is not fully realised. For example, the process of obtaining citizenship based on self-identification remains difficult, with government officials still unclear on how to implement these provisions. The broader narrative of Nepal being progressive is built on a superficial understanding of the situation.In August, Nepal’s Supreme Court ruled that Rukshana Kapali, a transgender woman, should be legally recognised as a woman on all documents without medical verification. How does this decision impact the future of LGBTQIA+ rights in Nepal?Rukshana’s case is a prominent victory, highlighting the judiciary’s support for LGBTQIA+ rights, especially compared to those of the executive and legislative branches. This ruling lays a strong foundation for similar future cases and will undoubtedly help in future activism. However, it’s important to note that the decision applies only to Kapali, meaning others will still need to go through the courts to have their gender identity legally recognised. How long must transgender individuals continue to endure lengthy court processes just to obtain citizenship?Even outside the courts, the bureaucratic hurdles—from medical reassignment surgeries to invasive checkups and long delays from the CDO (District Administration Office) to the Ministry of Home Affairs—can take years, with no guarantee of getting preferred names on legal documents. In many cases, even after completing the process, the names are inaccurately changed, such as altering Ram to Rama instead of the preferred name, like Manisha.We [Blue Diamond Society] get 15-20 complaints each year, primarily from transgender women, regarding difficulties in obtaining citizenship.The Supreme Court’s recent decision on same-sex marriage in Nepal has attracted global attention and gotten a positive response. Are there any limits to the court’s decision?After a long and arduous process, we secured temporary registration for same-sex marriages. On June 28, 2023, the Supreme Court, in the Pinky Gurung vs. Government of Nepal case, issued an interim order instructing the government to temporarily register same-sex marriages, including for those with “other” gender markers. That said, the Civil Code adopted in 2017 still defines marriage as a union between a ‘man’ and a ‘woman’.We, as a community, are pleased with the government’s temporary registration process. Yet it falls short of offering full marriage rights, including those related to property, adoption, and tax exemptions. While the court’s decision sets a supportive precedent, lack of clarity about the rights associated with the temporary certificate leaves many in limbo. So far, only around five couples have registered, and many in the community are hesitant to do so.The question remains: Can this temporary registration truly grant us the same recognition as heterosexual marriages? While the decision has garnered global praise, the LGBTQIA+ community on the ground continues to feel cheated of true equality. Our ultimate goal is to amend the Civil Code so that marriage is defined as a union between two individuals, rather than being restricted to one between male and female.Why do many court decisions on queer rights in Nepal, like of same-sex marriages, remain in limbo? Is this due to the government and courts trying to appease both conservative and progressive groups, or is it just a performative gesture of inclusivity?There are multiple factors at play. I think some responsibility also falls on activists. For example, when fighting for legal recognition since 2008, we should have advocated not only for the “third gender” or “other” but also for individuals who have transitioned from male to female or female to male. What’s more, policymakers and bureaucrats still lack awareness about human rights principles related to minority groups like the LGBTQIA+ community. Even though Nepal has ratified international conventions on human rights, these commitments have not been prioritised by lawmakers, which leads to this state of limbo and half-hearted inclusivity.As for the internal thought processes of bureaucrats and lawmakers, it’s hard to say. Many of them might still believe that the LGBTQIA+ community shouldn’t be granted full rights, so they engage in performative actions—appearing supportive on the surface to attract global attention but hesitating to fully advance our rights. This could explain why progress seems to stall midway.Queer rights have received some legal recognition. But how are they reflected in terms of social and cultural acceptance in Nepal?Legal changes and social acceptance need to go hand in hand. If we only focus on legal reforms without addressing societal attitudes, there will be no real change. We’ve seen this play out—there is legal recognition of gender identity, and temporary registration for same-sex marriage is available. Yet people struggle to fully realise these rights because of deep-rooted discrimination within families and society.In Nepal, a socially and culturally driven society, where family, relatives, and festivals play a major role, social acceptance is often more important than legal acceptance. When it comes to cultural acceptance, biases still persist. For example, it feels like we’re allowed to express ourselves openly only during the Pride Month in June. When we try to participate in other celebrations like Teej or Gaijatra, society often reacts negatively, asking why we need to “spoil” their festivals. This shows that social change is still lagging, despite the progress in legal rights.You mentioned that the queer community is often given the surface level of legal recognition. How is the state of the exercise of fundamental rights for LGBTQIA+ people in Nepal?Labelled as ‘gender and sexual minorities’, our broader struggles are ignored. When we raise concerns about poverty, food insecurity, or unemployment, the response we often get from government institutions and stakeholders is, “This isn’t our issue; it’s a gender problem.”We are just as much a part of society as anyone else. Issues like climate change, housing, and poverty affect us too. We want to be included in solutions, whether it’s participating in climate programs or being involved in community initiatives. Unfortunately, lawmakers and stakeholders often overlook that we are just as human as heterosexuals, with needs that go beyond legal recognition on paper.What are some aspects of the queer community that have not received enough attention in media narratives, and what tends to be unnecessarily highlighted?As I’ve mentioned before, the narrative surrounding our community often focuses heavily on issues like citizenship, while overlooking other important aspects of our lives. What’s missing is the correct representation of our contributions in various fields. Many LGBTQIA+ individuals are doctors, and experts in different professions, yet their accomplishments are only rarely acknowledged or represented. Instead, the focus often falls on the unfortunate image of some members of the community begging on the streets, which goes viral on social media.Another issue is the way we are predominantly associated with sex and sexuality. While these are important aspects of human identity, we are much more than that. We have other needs and rights that deserve attention. Unfortunately, the media tends to fixate on sexual aspects of the LGBTQIA+ community, reinforcing stereotypes. It’s time for the media to move beyond this narrow portrayal and include us in broader discussions that reflect the full scope of our lives.How has the current narrative of progressiveness in Nepal impacted real change for the LGBTQIA+ community?It’s time to move beyond this narrative of progressiveness. True progress should lead to further development, not be a barrier to it. Unfortunately, the current narrative seems to be stagnating.For instance, when we raise issues with the government, the response often is, “We’ve already given you the right to citizenship. You’re getting citizenship now.” Even when I travel people sometimes ask, “You’ve got citizenship, right? Things are becoming progressive.” This narrative of progressiveness has become an excuse for the government to claim they’ve done enough and to avoid further action.This surface-level progressiveness is used to showcase Nepal as forward-thinking internationally, but it hasn’t translated into real change for people at the grassroots. It also impedes activists’ efforts by providing the government with a shield against criticism. Until this narrative of progressiveness evolves into genuine, accountable action that goes beyond court decisions and performative gestures, it will continue to be a barrier to actual progress. \nThe weather will be partly to generally cloudy throughout the country on Monday.According to the Meteorological Forecasting Division, light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is likely to occur at a few places of the hilly regions and at one or two places of rest of the country.Tonight, it is forecast to be partly to generally cloudy in Koshi Province along with the hilly regions of rest of the country.

Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nAmid widespread deaths and devastation caused by monsoon across various districts, Nepal is at a heightened risk for water-borne, vector-borne, and air-borne disease outbreaks.With most water sources contaminated by rain and floodwater, and thousands of displaced people living in makeshift shelters, experts have warned of a potential surge in infections in the coming days.“People are already getting infected with water-borne, vector-borne and air-borne diseases,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “These problems could worsen in the coming days.” At least 209 people have been confirmed dead, while 29 others are still missing due to the floods and landslides triggered by record-breaking torrential rainfall that started Thursday evening. Additionally, 142 people have sustained various degrees of injury, and more than 4,222 others have been taken to safe places, the Home Ministry said on Monday evening. Doctors warn that the risk of water-borne, vector-borne and air-borne disease outbreaks increases in the aftermath of disasters. Nepal’s past experiences suggest the same.“People are already contracting cholera and other water-borne diseases,” said Dr Pun. “As displaced people mostly live in temporary shelters, the chances of spread of air-borne and vector-borne diseases remain high.”At least 95 people from various districts, including from Kathmandu and Lalitpur, have tested positive for cholera since the start of the monsoon in June. The Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool samples of the infected patients. Thousands of others were also infected with diarrheal infections after the start of the monsoon season. Diarrhoeal disease is a common and seasonal public health issue, usually triggered by unsafe food and water or hygiene issues. Likewise, six people died, and 12,644 others were hospitalised this year due to dengue, which has spread to 76 out of 77 districts across the country. Hundreds of people are contracting seasonal flu, but health authorities have no records of these cases.Officials at the Ministry of Health and Population said that they are bracing for tough days ahead, as the floodwaters not only contaminate drinking water sources but also create breeding grounds for various disease-spreading vectors.“We expect a surge in water-borne, vector-borne and air-borne diseases in the coming days, as it takes a few days for these illnesses to incubate,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “We have alerted all agencies concerned to step up vigilance and prepare to deal with any adverse situations.”Public health experts have warned that healthcare facilities in the disaster-hit districts could witness an uptick in cases of viral fever cases and waterborne diseases—diarrhoea, dysentery, food poisoning—and snakebites.Health Ministry officials say that they are aware of the risks and have directed agencies concerned to prepare accordingly.“We have stockpiled essential medicines in districts, provinces and at the central level,” said Dr Roshan Pokhrel, the secretary at the ministry. “Responding to the looming outbreaks is not only the responsibility of the Health Ministry, but also of other ministries and agencies, and we have been coordinating with them as well.”In addition to stepping up surveillance measures, stockpiling medicines, and deploying medics at the health facilities in disaster-hit areas, public health experts emphasise the importance of health awareness in reducing infections.They say a combination of careful surveys, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining hygiene and sanitation, social mobilisation and treatment are required to contain the possible outbreaks of various ailments.The monsoon in Nepal is itself a season of epidemics with thousands of people across the country getting infected with water-borne and vector-borne diseases.The country is one of the world’s most vulnerable to the climate crisis and has witnessed extreme weather events over the past decade and a half.Evidence suggests that the maximum temperature in Nepal is rising at a greater rate (0.056 degrees Celsius per year) than the global average of 0.03 degrees Celsius per year.Experts say extreme weather events—excess rainfall in a short period, continuous rains for several days after the monsoon, dry spells, droughts, below-average precipitation, and above-normal winter temperatures—have become more frequent in Nepal.In recent years, scientists have gathered credible evidence linking the climate crisis to adverse health effects that impact the quality of life and kill people. \nNearly 900 people, including foreign trekkers, have been rescued by helicopters from different flood-hit areas in the last two days after severe flooding and landslides disrupted vehicular movement across Nepal.Rishiram Tiwari, spokesperson of the Home Ministry, said Nepal Army choppers rescued 683 people—425 people on Sunday and 258 on Monday. “The rescue is ongoing,” he said. “Apart from disaster response conducted by the Nepal Army, private choppers have also been rescuing stranded foreigners, particularly in the mountain region.”The exact number of rescues conducted by private choppers is unknown, but operators said roughly 200 foreign trekkers and a few Nepalis have been evacuated in the last two days. Most highways across Nepal have been blocked by landslides and fallen trees, leaving thousands of travellers stranded. As a precaution, the government has banned nighttime bus service on some highways. According to the Home Ministry statement, the death toll from the landslides and flooding has risen to 209. Twenty-nine others are missing.The Nepal Army conducted emergency rescue operations in Kavrepalanchok and Sindhuli after the BP Highway was cut off, leaving hundreds of people stranded.The Airlines Operators Association of Nepal, the apex body of private operators, said they have been conducting rescues from the Everest region, Simikot, Manaslu, Langtang, Manthali, and other areas. Murali Dhar Joshi, the association's spokesperson, said an estimated 150 trekkers were stranded in Lukla, the gateway to the Everest region, after flights were affected since Thursday after heavy rains. “Flights have now resumed in Lukla, and we are evacuating trekkers,” he said. “We have also rescued trekkers from Khare and Lobuchee in the Everest region, who were stranded by the snowfall,” said Joshi of Simrik Air.He said that since it is trekking season, the movement of trekkers from Kathmandu to Lukla may rise in the coming days. Anil Manandhar, Corporate Manager at Shree Airlines, said they have been conducting rescues of both foreigners and Nepali citizens from different mountain areas, including Nepalthok in Kavrepalanchok.“On Monday, we rescued 25 people from different places.”According to him, nine Nepalis were rescued from Nepalthok, four (three foreigners and a Nepali) from Manang, three foreign trekkers from Langtang, and five foreign trekkers from Namchhe in the Everest region on Monday.Ramechhap Airport at Manthali, used for flights ferrying trekkers to Lukla during the peak season, has also been flooded. “The airport has since reopened, and foreigners were flown to Kathmandu,” said Joshi.Meanwhile, choppers have started airlifting hundreds of foreign mountaineers and trekkers stranded in Samagoan of Gorkha, to Kathmandu after protesting locals of Tsum Nubri Rural Municipality, in the Nepal-China border, were invited by the Home Minister to resolve the issue through talks.The locals of northern Gorkha have been protesting against the government for the last two weeks, demanding that Tsum Nubri rural municipality be removed from the list of restricted areas and chopper rescue operations be made easier. Nima Lama, chairman of Tsum Nubri Rural Municipality, said they are holding a discussion with the Home Ministry officials on Tuesday in Kathmandu. “The government has established a security camp at the border, and hence, there is no need to keep Tsum Nubri rural municipality in the restricted list,” he said. “Why do foreigners get a flying permit instantly, but locals have to wait for weeks for a rescue or medical evacuation flight? People are dying here due to slow emergency response.”Locals have also called for emergency rescue operations based on police recommendations, bypassing the existing lengthy approval process.Nearly 600 foreigners were stranded after the locals barred choppers from landing in the area.According to Lama, 40 evacuation flights were conducted on Monday after the protest was suspended on Sunday.Upper Mustang, upper Dolpo, Manaslu, lower Dolpo, upper Gorkha, Rasuwa, Manang, Humla, Mugu, Makalu, Kanchenjunga, Gunsha in Taplejung, and a few areas in Dolakha are among the restricted areas in Nepal where even helicopters cannot enter without a special permit.The process of obtaining a permit is so long that patients requiring urgent medical care risk dying before help arrives. The restricted areas lie along the northern border with China. In these places, lengthy official procedures must be completed to fly sick or injured persons to hospitals.According to a representative of a helicopter company, to get a permit, they have to make the rounds of the Home and Tourism ministries and the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal. There are many cases of sick or injured people dying by the time the permit is finally granted, the representative said.According to helicopter operators, there are typically six steps involved in obtaining a permit for medical evacuation flight. First, the family chartering the flight has to submit a request in writing to the chief district officer of the district concerned, and also provide a copy of the application to the helicopter company.Second, the helicopter company must write separately to the chief district officer. Third, after the application is verified, the chief district officer writes to the Home Ministry recommending that a permit be issued.Fourth, the Home Ministry issues a permit based on the identity of the sick or injured person.Fifth, the Home Ministry writes to the Tourism Ministry stating that security issues have been cleared and the helicopter may be granted a permit. Finally, the Tourism Ministry writes to the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal to issue a permit.On different occasions, the former parliamentary International Relations Committee directed the government to make arrangements for issuing helicopter rescue permits in restricted areas through local administrations. However, the directive has not been heeded.The House panel issued the directive following complaints about an increase in the number of deaths caused by delays in medical evacuation flights due to complex paperwork.  \nAs the rain-induced landslides have damaged the major roads connecting Kathmandu Valley with the rest of the country, the Prithvi Highway is likely to witness more traffic during the upcoming Dashain festival.Officials at the Department of Roads said that as other roads are unlikely to be ready for use, the only option for those travelling to and from the Valley will be the Kathmandu-Mugling highway, even as the highway itself is in a shoddy condition following heavy rainfall.Bus operators point to the need for government agencies to work on a war-footing to ease festive travel.“When major highways connecting Kathmandu Valley are disrupted, the only functional one, the Prithvi Highway, will be in high use during Dashain,” Amit Kumar Sharma, information officer at the Department of Roads, told the Post. “But the highway itself is disrupted at different places.”Thanks to efforts of the Nepal Army, the Armed Police Force, the Nepal Police and other agencies, the Prithvi Highway, which was disrupted since Saturday, has now become functional.However, according to the officer of the department, under Nagdhunga-Mugling section, two-way roads have been opened in Mauwa Khola, Hukdikhola, Fishling, Kalikhola, Simaltal, Jalbire, and Ghoptebhir sections. However, as of this writing, vehicular movement was open only one-way along the Jhyaple Khola and Jawang Khola sections, both of which are key routes into the capital city.“Even though there are some disturbances, the Prithvi Highway has now become functional,” acting spokesperson of traffic police Rabin Karki told the Post. “If there is no disruption by further rainfall, the highway will be fully functional before Dashain.”Dashain, a major Hindu festival, starts on October 3 and will be celebrated until October 14. Last year, almost 1.5 million people left Kathmandu Valley for their home districts during Dashain, according to the Nepal Transport Entrepreneurs Association. Bus operators, however, expect the number to decline this year due to the hassles in travel owing to poor roads.According to the department of roads, the BP Highway, which connects most of the eastern parts of the country with the Kathmandu Valley, is disrupted at Nepalthok, Kavre. The vehicles that come through Bardibas will be stopped in Nepalthok, says the officer of the road department.“Due to the difficult topography of the road section, this highway will take a few more days to be fully functional,” Sharma, the information officer of the road department, said. “A team from our department is in the field to collect detailed information.”Likewise, Kanti Rajpath, the other highway connecting Kathmandu to Tarai districts through Makawanpur, is also not in good condition due to damages caused by incessant rains.In this section of the highway, the damage caused by heavy rainfall on the bridges pose a big challenge for the resumption of vehicular movement. “Although we repaired the highway, the road might not be usable for vehicular movement during Dashain,” Sharma said.The heavy rains also disrupted the Araniko Highway. The road department office says even though people can travel up to Barhabise and Jiri via this highway, the connection to China has been disrupted. The condition of the Mid-hill Highway that connects several hill districts is not good either.Sharma says the road department plans to create diversion roads on various highways targeting Dashain. “Considering the movement of hundreds of thousands of people during Dashain, the department will soon make diversion roads on BP Highway, Mid-hill Highway and Mechi Highway, all of which were badly hit by recent rainfalls,” Sharma added.Bijay Swar, chair of the National Transport Entrepreneurs’ Association, says that despite their preparations, persistent rain, floods, and landslides could still have a big impact on people’s travel plans this Dashain. After the disruption of the BP Highway, Kanti Rajpath could have been used as an alternative but the highway is also in poor condition. “Now we only have the option of Prithvi Highway,” Swar told the Post.If the government does not declare an emergency in public transport and work on a fast-track basis to make the roads functional, the Dashain trips could be full of hassles, officials say.Apart from the poor road condition, another major challenge during Dashain would be old vehicles, which often break down in the middle of the road, causing traffic jams. But traffic police say they have a plan to manage such vehicles.“We will coordinate with various state agencies, especially at the district level, to ensure that people will have no difficulty travelling during Dashain,” acting spokesperson of traffic Karki said. \nNepal, India and Bangladesh are scheduled to sign a landmark agreement on Thursday to export 40 megawatts of electricity generated in Nepal to Bangladesh.The tripartite agreement will involve the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA), NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Limited of India, and the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB). Under the terms of the agreement, the NEA will receive 6.40 US cents per unit of electricity. The Indian side is involved in the deal as Nepal and Bangladesh are using the transmission line of India to transmit the energy through the territory of the southern neighbour.Originally scheduled for July 28, the signing was postponed due to political tension and change of government in Bangladesh.Chiranjeevi Chataut, spokesperson for the Ministry of Energy, Water Resources, and Irrigation, said meetings at the energy secretary and joint-secretary levels will be held in Kathmandu on Tuesday and Wednesday to complete all the preparations for the agreement.The NEA plans to sell electricity to Bangladesh annually during the rainy season, from June 15 to November 15. The expected export is 144,000 megawatt-hours, and the NEA estimates earnings of USD 9.216 million over these five months.Electricity will be exported to Bangladesh via the Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur 400 kV transmission line, with the metering point in Muzaffarpur. The NEA will bear any technical losses incurred in the transmission line from Dhalkebar to Muzaffarpur.Electricity will reach Bangladesh through the 400 kV transmission line from Beharampur (India) to Bhedamara (Bangladesh). The NEA intends to export electricity generated from its 25-megawatt Trishuli project and 22-megawatt Chilime project, both of which have received approval for electricity exports to India.On December 6, 2023, Bangladesh’s Cabinet Economic Affairs Committee granted in-principle approval for importing 40 megawatts of electricity from Nepal. Subsequently, BPDB issued a tender for the purchase of electricity for five years, in line with the tripartite agreement among Nepal, Bangladesh, and India, on January 1.A team from the NEA held discussions with the BPDB’s tender evaluation committee on February 22 in Dhaka. Nepal initially proposed a price of 6.70 US cents per unit; however, an agreement could not be reached as Nepal insisted on not offering a lower price than that charged to India. After bilateral discussions at the SAARC Energy Secretary-level meeting hosted by the World Bank in Singapore, Bangladesh agreed to a reduced price of 6.40 US cents.Although an agreement on the price was reached, the Bangladesh Cabinet’s Public Procurement Committee only approved the import price on June 11. After evaluating the submitted tender documents, BPDB informed the NEA on July 7 of its intent to accept the tender.The NEA confirmed its acceptance of the tender and promptly received a draft of the electricity sales agreement from BPDB. The NEA then scheduled the agreement date and invited BPDB on July 10.However, the deal became uncertain following widespread protests against the government in Bangladesh, which led to the resignation of then-prime minister Sheikh Hasina. Despite this, the interim government’s Chief Adviser Mohammad Yunus assured that importing electricity from Nepal would continue, paving the way for the forthcoming agreement.___ \nNepal and the United States have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to establish a bilateral consultation mechanism. The agreement was signed by the US Under Secretary for Political Affairs John Bass and Minister for Foreign Affairs Arzu Rana Deuba.“This agreement will deepen cooperation in areas such as trade, investment, tourism, and infrastructure, strengthening the foundation for meaningful and mutually beneficial collaboration between Nepal and the United States,” Foreign Minister Rana said in a post on X. Typically, such bilateral consultation mechanisms are led by the foreign secretaries of the respective countries. These meetings take place alternately and discuss the full scope of bilateral relations. Nepal has arrangements similar to those of several other nations.Following the MoU signing, Foreign Minister Rana and Under Secretary Bass exchanged views on key issues of mutual interest.According to Nepal’s Embassy in Washington, D.C., the MoU will enable senior officials from Nepal’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the US State Department to hold periodic consultations, alternating between Kathmandu and Washington, D.C., to discuss the entirety of Nepal-US relations.Foreign Minister Rana will depart for Doha, leading Nepal’s delegation at the Asia Cooperation Dialogue (ACD) Summit, before returning to Kathmandu. Prior to this, she attended the 79th United Nations General Assembly in New York. \nOn April 26, 2024, sidhakura.com, an online portal, disseminated a series of malicious audio-video content involving the chairs of two media houses. The fake content even dragged the Supreme Court, citing that the two chairs had met incumbent and former SC justices and senior advocates to dismiss over 400 corruption court cases. When the misleading content spread, the judicial body immediately responded, launching a suo moto contempt of court case against the portal’s publisher and editor. After months of investigation, the court on Sunday issued a final verdict and showed the prison’s door to the guilty. In addition to the portal’s publisher and editor, who got a prison sentence of three months each, another person, who supposedly conducted the infamous ‘sting operation’ on the portal’s behalf got six months in jail. Such harsh sentencing was due, and it gives a clear message that anyone who peddles false news in the name of journalism will be severely punished. The timely verdict also draws a clear line between free speech and disinformation and misinformation. The online portal’s claims were based on false premises and ambiguities. First, without any regard for media ethics, the editor and the publisher sensationalised the content, relying on an unverified audio clip provided by a third party. Second, when the Supreme Court and Press Council Nepal summoned them to be present at the court with evidence to substantiate their reports, they failed to do so. The sidhakura content unfortunately represents one of many cases of fake news that have surfaced in Nepal with the advent of new forms of technology, which in turn undermines democracy and the rule of law. Whether on social media platforms or traditional media outlets, disinformation intended to mislead people and misinformation with outright lies have become all too common. The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) has escalated the problem with the help of deepfakes—audio recordings, video clips or images replicating someone else’s identity using AI tools to spread false information. Deepfakes have been used not only to damage reputations but also to ‘report’ on events that are impossible in real life. In the recent tragic flooding and other natural disasters, deepfake videos simulating various kinds of calamities have been circulated, either to get views and likes or to spread fear. Fake news and deepfakes have also affected elections in many countries this year.Nepal’s Electronic Transaction Act, the umbrella law covering such cases, is limited in scope, primarily focused on traditional forms of crimes like digital fraud and identity theft. It doesn’t address emerging threats brought about by artificial intelligence. A new law to incorporate these has thus become vital. As important is sensitising people about the consequences of defaming other people through news outlets or social media platforms. The precedent set by Sunday’s ruling will help. While the media must be free to investigate and report on sensitive issues, this freedom cannot be misused to spread baseless rumours. Sunday’s verdict can be a good place to start the much-needed conversation on the regulation of various kinds of media. This debate will have to be extensive and nuanced as it is so easy to err in this case, either on the side of too much caution or too much liberty. \nAccording to police reports, by Monday evening, the freak monsoon downpour and the resultant flooding and mudslides over the weekend have claimed over 200 lives. About 127 people have been injured, and 56 are still missing. The government claims that some 4,022 stranded people on the damaged highways and flooded zones across Nepal have been successfully rescued. There are no official figures on the loss of lives and properties in the Kathmandu Valley and beyond.Yet, every patch of dark cloud in the sky seems ominous. Weather experts have warned of more heavy rains in the coming days. However, what is most worrying is the government's lack of preparedness. Returning from the UN General Assembly Meeting in the United States on Monday, Prime Minister Khadka Prasad Sharma Oli said that he hadn’t even imagined this level of flooding in Kathmandu.A national disaster People call this a natural disaster; I’d rather call it a national disaster of epic proportions. The government, led by a coalition of the two largest parties—the Nepali Congress and the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist Leninist)—miserably failed to not only protect people’s lives but also, according to its admission, to coordinate the resources and manpower to save them. Even Balen Shah, the Mayor of Kathmandu Metropolitan City, who has made quite a name for himself by doing some remarkable works in the capital city, failed to mobilise his offices. He announced the dispatch of 300 city police personnel only after the river systems here had flooded tremendously and claimed some lives. How pathetic!True, he may not be able to do much in such an unplanned and unmanaged capital town. He has done his best to destroy some illegal constructions and somehow restore the old glory. Shah has also displayed his zeal for discovering and reviving, albeit with limited success, some traditional river systems that have been legally or illegally buried under the concrete for centuries. In this effort, the mayor has fought with many parties and the traditional court systems. Yet, this time, the charismatic mayor had no substantial disaster management plans. Some members of the political parties, including those from the opposition, the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre), volunteered to search and rescue people buried alive in the mud. I wish more people were deployed by parties and other organisations to serve the needy in the affected areas. But this is not enough. It’s time all parties, big and small, took the issue of natural disasters more seriously. It’s important to revitalise the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority, appoint exporters and allocate more resources instead of merely using them as a tool to appease party workers. To achieve this and other vital things, there must be a robust debate in the Parliament, including in state legislatures, about how best to tackle the recurring problem of landslides and flooding. They should get the help of experts in the area and international experts to design policies and programmes for preventing and swiftly dealing with natural catastrophes. What we’ve just witnessed has been a national disgrace. Even the vehicles and people buried in Jhyaple Khola—very close to Kathmandu and next to the starting point of the near-complete underground tunnel system built by Japan—were dug out of the mud after many hours. What took so long? Good use of helicopters?We may be too poor to own an airforce; defence-wise, it’s not essential either. However, the least the government could do is engage dedicated army helicopters in disaster management. Importantly, as some retired police officers have publicly stressed, it’s time the Nepal Police had its own helicopters suitable for swift action, at least for the aid of communities nestled in remote hills and mountains. If parties are serious about this problem, they should stop using government helicopters to carry leaders to every nook and corner of the country—especially for partisan events. If they want to use them, they should pay separately. There must be a strict check and balance on this matter. This way, much of the resources wasted in the service of big or influential leaders could be channelled to people badly hit by floods and landslides. The language of disasterOn Monday, in an article in Setopati, veteran journalist and writer Narayan Wagle claimed that we have never tried to understand the “language” of disasters. He says that every natural disaster, including the big 2015 Gorkha Earthquakes, makes a statement, but neither the government nor people understand its meaning. He blamed mainly the journalists for their persistent enthusiasm to report the quantities of deaths and injuries but little interest in debating possible ways to minimise the harm. I agree with Wagle: We all need to do some serious soul-searching about our attitude to natural calamities and their deadly impacts. Only when we, the members of civil society, are sensitive to the issue can we hold the government accountable. Needless to say, much of our civil society is linked to political parties and national and international non-government organisations. The ruling CPN (UML) boasts the largest number of members who either run or work for NGOs and INGOs. These bodies also have more resources and, in some cases, expertise. Working with the government at all levels through party channels, they could and should play a vital role in raising sensitivities towards the problem of disaster management.Disaster prevention and management is one of the few areas which is relatively non-political and uncontroversial. Parties on the left, right or centre wouldn’t object to the policies and programmes for disaster mitigation and management. And, of course, foreign government and non-government agencies would readily offer a hand with financial resources and expertise. I’m pretty certain that all donors would be willing to help the Nepal Police and Nepal Army with a few light helicopters useful for search and rescue after natural calamities.  \nIt has been over a month since the protests against Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli and the Nepali Congress Chairperson Sher Bahadur Deuba at Tundikhel, Kathmandu. Oli and Deuba were on a decorated stage to inaugurate the celebration of Gaura Parva and greet the assembled public. Gaura Parva is one of the biggest festivals in Western Nepal, celebrated annually to commemorate the marriage between Hindu goddess Gauri and lord Shiva. As Oli-Deuba lit candles to begin the programme, shouts of \"Oli Chor, Desh Chhod\" (Leave the country, Oli the thief) filled the air. The shouting continued when the duo, Oli first and then Deuba, delivered their greetings. A large group of young men in the audience led the protest. The protest leaders were arrested by the police the following day. Not long after, Man Bahadur Karki, a common citizen who sells mo:mo in Bouddha, was incarcerated for criticising the prime minister on his Facebook account. The slogans and shouting expressed outrage against politicians under whose watch Nepal's standing in the world has dropped to one of the poorest and most corrupt countries. Nepal's economy is in dire straits, public education is in shambles, and public institutions are dysfunctional. Thousands of despondent young men and women leave the country every year seeking work. The demonstration and the subsequent arrests sparked a heated debate in parliament. Many parliament members and media pundits saw in the protest the potential for a mass movement against the ruling politicians, akin to what transpired in Bangladesh. This possibility of a significant shift in Nepal's political landscape is both intriguing and engaging. What is the likelihood of a transformation in Nepal? Could removing the current brand of politicians pave the way for a new era of value-based governance and politics? Seeking answers, my mind wandered to my days in Iran in 1977-78 and Nepal just before the 1990 ‘jana andolan’. Iran 1977-79In late 1977, I worked on a vast pulp and paper factory construction project in Iran, a \"peaceful\" place. I enjoyed my work and the Iranians. But I wasn’t aware that the peace masked the undercurrent of simmering public anger against the Iranian King Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi's pro-American, \"anti-Islam\" policies and corruption in his government. The Shah's forces had, over the years, successfully crushed many sporadic anti-Shah protests led by the Imams and the banned pro-Soviet Tudeh party. Both Shah and the Americans saw these protests as minor irritants. There was a sense of entitlement and invincibility in Shah's government. In August 1978, a fire in a cinema hall in the province of Abadan killed nearly 400 people. Shah's opponents blamed the government for it. The government denied it, but no one believed them. People had lost trust in the state. A few months after the cinema fire, another anti-Shah protest erupted under the rallying cry of Ruhollah Khomeini, an Islamic cleric. Tudeh, a pro-Soviet party, joined forces with Khomeini. SAVAK, Shah's secret police, arrested and manhandled the protestors, further inflaming the conflict. Ordinary people started joining the protests. Mohammad Reza Shah fled the country in January 1979. ‘Jana andolan’ 1990For years, people's anger against the 30-year-old 'Partyless Panchayat System', a euphemism for King Mahendra's authoritarian rule, simmered under Kathmandu's peaceful veneer. The blatant abuse of power and corruption by those close to the palace alienated ordinary people from the royal regime. Sporadic protests against the government had happened before 1990, but the King's forces had crushed them. A sense of entitlement and invincibility prevailed among the Royals and their close associates.In early 1990, the Nepali Congress and Nepal's Communist parties joined forces and called for public protests, demanding the dismissal of the ban on political parties and the restoration of democracy. No one, including the leaders of the \"Movement for the Restoration of Democracy (MRD),\" seemed confident whether the movement would succeed.A couple of months before the MRD's scheduled start date, I asked Ganesh Man Singh, the movement's leader, to estimate the number of people who may join them. He said, \"Twenty thousand, thirty thousand.\" I asked if the movement would be successful. \"I do not know. We have to do what we have to do,\" he replied. Girija Prasad Koirala's answer was similar. Two days later, former Speaker of the House Daman Dhungana and I met Jaggananth Upadhya, Minister of Land Reform in BP Koirala's cabinet and a leader of the Nepali Congress, at his home in Thimi. His answer to my question was, \"I think in the beginning, about sixty thousand. But it will grow as the movement spreads.\"The MRD started on February 18, 1990. As the movement grew, the king's forces tried to crush the protestors violently. The state's violence gave unexpected momentum to the movement. People from all over the country started joining it. Finally, 49 days after the MRD began, the king buckled. On April 8, 1990, he lifted the ban on political parties. Will Nepal be a repeat of Bangladesh?Observations in Iran, Nepal and other countries, including countries impacted by the Arab Springs, point to a distinctive pattern that successful mass movements follow: Longest-serving politicians become numb to citizens' aspirations, develop a sense of entitlement and invincibility and lose people's trust; they successfully crush sporadic public uprisings against their abuses; suddenly, one day (no one knows when), the pent-up public discontent explodes; protests gain momentum; the government gets increasingly repressive; angered by the repression, the protesting mass grows beyond the government control, and the politicians give in or flee the country. In Nepal, hardly anyone trusts politicians; public anger against the leaders simmers. The supposedly democratic government is beginning to show signs of repression against the opposition, manifest in the arrest of Tundikhel protestors and those wearing tee shirts with the image of Balen Shah (Kathmandu's mayor, whom Oli dislikes) in Indra Jatra. Thus, the underlying conditions for an unexpected mass uprising are alive and present. Time will tell whether this will translate into a repeat of Bangladesh. The concern is that the \"repeat of Bangladesh\" may be a fitting punishment for politicians who have failed us, but it is unlikely to bring Nepal to the path of prosperity. Past uprisings, such as ‘jana andolan’, did not do it. In Iran, the Islamic government that followed the Shah has turned out to be worse than the Shah's. Arab Spring countries have similar experiences. The best alternative for Nepal is to replace the old politicians with competent people with a proven commitment to public service through the electoral process. \nOn Saturday, massive rains left at least 64 people dead and countless more injured. It uprooted people from their homes and left thousands without phone lines and electricity. Economic damages alone were estimated at between $95 billion and $100 billion. Local disaster responders said that given the scale of the event, some deaths and destruction were inevitable, even with the best of preparations. The trail of devastation that Hurricane Helene has left in its wake in the southeastern United States is the worst in decades. On the same day, halfway across the world in Nepal, incessant rains and floods and landslides killed at least 170, injured another 100, while 68 went missing. In Kathmandu Valley alone, 37 people perished in the heaviest rains the valley has seen in 54 years. Police personnel and rescue workers were digging up debris in multiple locations in the country, in the fear that more people might be buried. Both in the southeastern US seaboard and Nepal, Saturday’s water-induced disasters can be attributed to unpredictable weather. Yet, at least in Nepal’s case, climate change is only a part of a much larger story of neglect.Saturday’s tragedy in Nepal represents an egregious failure of the Nepali state to keep its citizens safe. Days in advance, the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology had been putting out reminders that the country was in for unprecedented rains. The message was endlessly broadcast through media platforms as well as each and every cell phone. Yet, when the tragedy struck, responsible government agencies seemed completely unprepared. Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak made a mockery of himself when he attributed the government’s failure to save four people who were stranded on their roof in Nakhu of Lalitpur to ‘poor visibility’ as a result of which choppers, supposedly, could not reach them. But then a good samaritan, Chaniklal Tamang, managed to rescue two of them by diving into the swollen Nakhu River. There could not be a better sign of the Nepali state’s incompetence. Not just incompetence though. The casual way high-ranking government officials like Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, Deputy Prime Minister Prakash Man Singh and Home Minister Lekhak have responded to queries over the government’s handling of the crisis shows an utter disregard for the lives of common folks. It was also galling that the police and army personnel deployed for rescue efforts, be it in Kathmandu or Dhading, reported having to work without basic equipment like raft jackets and rescue ropes. This suggests that even though water-induced disasters claim thousands of lives every year in Nepal, disaster preparedness and response have never been the state’s priority. It is easy to see why. Those in leadership positions in the government are too busy scheming to prolong their stay in power—when not working for various vested interests. Except during election time, seldom do they spend any time listening to people’s concerns. The country’s prime minister sending back from New York his smiling pictures with VVIPs while his country struggled with a national tragedy was not just a matter of poor optics and iffy judgment. In the eyes of the Nepali people, it was also an indication of his misplaced priorities. \nOne-way traffic resumed along the Daunne section of the East-West Highway at 8:30am on Tuesday after a landslide that obstructed the road on Monday night was cleared.Kamal Thapa, information officer at the Bardaghat Area Police Office, said small vehicles and motorcycles have begun using the route. However, authorities are facing difficulties in managing the long traffic congestion.The ongoing widening of the Narayanghat-Butwal road section continues to cause delays, with only 52.7 percent of work completed after six years and multiple deadline extensions. This has become a major concern during the Dashain travel rush. \n Mount Everest is Earth’s tallest mountain – towering 5.5 miles (8.85 km) above sea level – and is actually still growing.While it and the rest of the Himalayas are continuing an inexorable uplift that dates back to their birth roughly 50 million years ago when the Indian subcontinent collided with Eurasia, Everest is growing more than expected from this alone. Scientists now think they know the reason why, and it has to do with the monumental merger of two nearby river systems.Everest has gained roughly 49-164 feet (15-50 meters) in height due to this change in the regional river system, with the Kosi river merging with the Arun river approximately 89,000 years ago, the researchers estimated. That translates to an uplift rate of roughly 0.01-0.02 inches (0.2-0.5 millimeters) per year.The geological process at work, they said, is called isostatic rebound. It involves the rise of land masses on Earth’s crust when the weight of the surface diminishes. The crust, Earth’s outermost layer, essentially floats atop a mantle layer made of hot, semi-liquid rock.In this case, the merger of the rivers – more like a hostile takeover, with the Kosi subjugating the Arun as the rivers changed course over time – resulted in accelerated erosion that has carried off huge amounts of rock and soil, reducing the weight of the region near Everest.“Isostatic rebound can be likened to a floating object adjusting its position when weight is removed,” said geoscientist Jin-Gen Dai of China University of Geosciences in Beijing, one of the leaders of the study published on Monday in the journal *Nature Geoscience*.“When a heavy load, such as ice or eroded rock, is removed from the Earth’s crust, the land beneath slowly rises in response, much like a boat rising in water when cargo is unloaded,” Dai added.The main gorge of the merged river system is located approximately 28 miles (45 km) east of Everest.The researchers, who used numerical models to simulate the evolution of the river system, estimated that isostatic rebound accounts for about 10% of Everest’s annual uplift rate.This geological process is not unique to the Himalayas.“A classic example is in Scandinavia, where the land is still rising in response to the melting of thick ice sheets that covered the region during the last Ice Age. This process continues today, affecting coastlines and landscapes, thousands of years after the ice retreated,” Dai said.Study co-author Adam Smith, a University College London doctoral student in Earth sciences, said GPS measurements reveal the continued rising of Everest and the rest of the Himalayas.This uplift outpaces the continued surface erosion caused by factors such as wind, rain and river flow. As this erosion continues, Everest’s uplift rate from isostatic rebound may increase, Smith said.Neighbouring peaks including Lhotse, the world’s fourth highest, and Makalu, the fifth highest, also get a boost from the same process. Lhotse is experiencing an uplift rate similar to Everest. Makalu, situated closer to the Arun, has a slightly higher uplift rate.“This research underscores our planet’s dynamic nature. Even a seemingly immutable feature like Mount Everest is subject to ongoing geological processes, reminding us that Earth is constantly changing, often in ways imperceptible in our daily lives,” Dai said.Earth’s rigid outer part is divided into colossal plates that move gradually over time in a process called plate tectonics, with the Himalayas rising following a collision between two plates.Everest, also called Sagarmatha in Nepali and Chomolungma in Tibetan, is situated on the border between Nepal and the Tibet Autonomous Region of China. It was named for George Everest, a 19th century British surveyor in India.“Mount Everest occupies a unique place in human consciousness,” Dai said.“Physically, it represents Earth’s highest point, giving it immense significance simply by virtue of its stature,” Dai added. “Culturally, Everest is sacred to local Sherpa and Tibetan communities. Globally, it symbolizes the ultimate challenge, embodying human endurance and our drive to surpass perceived limits.” \n Israel’s widely expected ground invasion of Lebanon appeared to be getting underway early on Tuesday as its military said troops had begun “limited” raids against Hezbollah targets in the border area.The military said in a statement that it had begun “limited, localised, and targeted ground raids based on precise intelligence” against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon villages close to the border that posed “an immediate threat to Israeli communities in northern Israel”.It said the air force and artillery were supporting the ground forces with “precise strikes.”Local residents in the Lebanese border town of Aita al-Shaab reported heavy shelling and the sound of helicopters and drones overhead. Flares were repeatedly launched over the Lebanese border town of Rmeish, lighting up the night sky.On Monday, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant had told local council heads in northern Israel that the next phase of the war along Lebanon’s southern border would begin soon, and would support the aim of bringing home Israelis who have fled Hezbollah rockets during nearly a year of border warfare.The ground invasion represents an escalating conflict in the Middle East between Israel and Iran-backed militants, sparked by an assault on Israel by Palestinian militant group Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023, that now threatens to suck in the US and Iran.An Israeli strike in Lebanon early on Tuesday targeted Mounir Maqdah, commander of the Lebanese branch of the Palestinian Fatah movement’s military wing, the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, according to two Palestinian security officials.His fate was unknown.The strike hit a building in the crowded Ain al-Hilweh Palestinian refugee camp near the southern city of Sidon, the sources said. It marked the first strike on the camp, Lebanon’s largest Palestinian camp, since cross-border hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel broke out nearly a year ago.In Syria, three civilians were killed and nine others injured in an Israeli airstrike on the capital Damascus, Syrian state media said on Tuesday citing a military source. Israel’s military said it does not comment on foreign media reports.Israel has been carrying out strikes against Iran-linked targets in Syria for years but has ramped up raids since the Hamas attack on Israel’s southern territory on Oct. 7, 2023.Hamas killed 1,200 people and took about 250 hostage in its assault on Israel, according to Israeli tallies. Israel in response launched a massive assault on Hamas in Gaza, reducing most of the Palestinian territory to rubble, displacing most of its 2.3 million people and killing more than 41,300 Palestinians, according to the Gaza health ministry.STRIKES ON BEIRUTIsrael’s ground invasion into Lebanon follows its deadly detonation of booby-trapped Hezbollah pagers, two weeks of airstrikes, and its killing on Friday of Hezbollah head Hassan Nasrallah, which dealt the group one of the heaviest blows in decades.The intensive air strikes have eliminated several Hezbollah commanders but also killed about 1,000 civilians and forced one million to flee their homes, according to the Lebanese government.Overnight, strikes hit Beirut’s southern suburbs, a security source said. A Reuters reporter witnessed a flash of light and a series of loud blasts about an hour after the Israeli military warned residents to evacuate areas near buildings it said contained Hezbollah infrastructure south of the Lebanese capital.In the past 24 hours, at least 95 people had been killed and 172 wounded in Israeli strikes on Lebanon’s southern regions, the eastern Bekaa Valley, and Beirut, Lebanon’s health ministry said early on Tuesday.Hezbollah’s deputy leader Naim Qassem, in a first public speech on Monday since Nasrallah’s death, said that “the resistance forces are ready for a ground engagement.”He said Hezbollah had continued to fire rockets as deep as 150 km (93 miles) into Israeli territory.“We know that the battle may be long. We will win as we won in the liberation of 2006,” he said, referring to the last big conflict between the two foes.Late on Monday, Lebanese troops pulled back about five kilometres (3 miles) from positions along Lebanon’s southern border with Israel, a Lebanese security source told Reuters. A Lebanese army spokesperson did not confirm or deny the movement.Lebanon’s army has historically stayed on the sidelines of major conflicts with Israel, and in the last year of hostilities has not fired on the Israeli military.The White House and the US State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Israel’s ground operations in Lebanon.But on Monday, US President Joe Biden had called for a ceasefire.“I’m more worried than you might know and I’m comfortable with them stopping,” Biden told reporters when asked if he was comfortable with Israeli plans for a cross-border incursion. “We should have a ceasefire now.”Israel last week rejected a proposal by the US and France calling for a 21-day ceasefire on the Lebanon border to give time for a diplomatic settlement that would allow displaced civilians on both sides to return home. \nThere is a saying that social service professionals tackling family violence are familiar with: If you don’t break out of the cycle of violence, the cycle will break you.I learnt this from Ms Lorraine Lim, deputy chief executive of the Singapore Council of Women’s Organisations (SCWO), who explained that the cycle of violence describes the phases in an abusive relationship.For example, there is the honeymoon phase after the incidence of violence when the abusive husband may shower his wife with greater affection and promise never to use force again.Thinking the worst is over, the woman goes on with life – until the man flares up again, and the cycle repeats. Ms Lim said: “Studies have shown that if you don’t break this cycle of violence, it will escalate.”Helping victims of domestic abuse break out of the cycle of violence is a major challenge, and perhaps the biggest hurdle is getting them to report the abuse in the first place.Like other social workers interviewed, Ms Lim said family violence cases tend to be under-reported. The shame of being abused and the fear that reporting violence will sever the relationship or get a loved one in trouble with the law are among the reasons why victims stay silent.At the SCWO’s Star Shelter for women and children who are survivors of family violence, many women had endured the abuse for an average of between four and seven years before they sought help, she said.A parliamentary reply in 2023 laid bare just how hard it is for an abused child, or the child’s family members, to report a loved one who hurt the child to the authorities.Of the cases that the Ministry of Social and Family Development’s (MSF) Child Protective Service (CPS) investigates, abused children who directly reported the matter to the CPS form less than 0.5 per cent, while those reported by family members of the abused child make up less than 1.5 per cent of the cases probed.Instead, over 95 per cent of reports were made by community groups such as pre-schools, schools, healthcare facilities, the police and social service agencies.In another parliamentary reply in 2023, it was revealed that about 90 per cent of child abuse cases investigated by the CPS were committed by parents or caregivers.On Sept 26, MSF released the first Domestic Violence Trends report, which contains data on child, elder and spousal abuse.It showed that there were 2,008 new spousal violence cases in 2023, up by 15 per cent from 1,741 such cases in 2022. In 2021, the figure was 1,632.The number of new Tier 1 child abuse cases, defined as those with low to moderate safety and risk concerns, rose 17 per cent from 2,377 cases in 2021 to 2,787 cases in 2023. There were 2,760 such cases in 2022.Greater awareness and better detectionThis rise in lower-risk child abuse and spousal violence cases may actually be a positive development. Social service professionals who work with victims of family violence cite two factors that have contributed to the growing numbers.First, there is more awareness of family violence and a greater willingness to report the abuse.Not only are more victims and their loved ones seeking help to stop the violence, some abusers are also realising they need help, social workers say.Ms Joyz Tan, director of Fei Yue Family Service Centre, said it is seeing some individuals seek help to manage their anger issues after realising their behaviour is considered abusive.Beyond physical violence, the public is also now more aware about emotional and psychological abuse too, she said.This is a good sign. The violence that takes place behind closed doors cannot be addressed if no one speaks out or seeks help. Social workers note that if the abuse is not addressed, it tends to worsen over time.Second, more people have been trained to spot and report the abuse. More than 9,300 people in various sectors, such as childcare staff and school teachers, have so far been trained to spot and report signs of family violence, the MSF said. Certain groups, such as social service professionals, get more in-depth training in this area, social workers say.Training professionals and people in the community to spot and report the abuse is critical because many victims stay mum about the abuse, or may not know what to do or who to turn to for help. Ms Han Yah Yee, acting chief executive of Montfort Care, said: “The increase in Tier 1 (child abuse) cases may not be a bad thing as it’s better for cases to be reported early before it escalates to become Tier 2 cases.”Tier 2 abuse cases are high-risk cases that may warrant removing the child from the family to keep him safe. They are managed by the MSF’s Child Protective Service, while Tier 1 cases are managed by community agencies such as Child Protection Specialist Centres. The number of new Tier 2 child abuse cases fell slightly from 2,141 cases in 2021 to 2,011 cases in 2023. Early detection and intervention by community agencies would have prevented cases from escalating in risk, said the MSF spokeswoman.From what social workers say, the child protection ecosystem is now better organised and better equipped to detect and manage child abuse cases. Hence, it is perhaps not surprising that more cases are detected.More reported cases may not mean more people being abusedThe rise in the number of new Tier 1 child abuse cases may not mean there are actually many more children being abused. What it could mean is that cases which could have previously gone unreported are coming to light now.The Government’s focus on family violence and the resources pumped into tackling this scourge have made a significant difference, social workers say.They point to the work of the Task Force on Family Violence set up in 2020, which made 16 recommendations that are being progressively implemented.These recommendations are in four areas: increasing awareness of family violence, making it easier to report the violence and get immediate help, boosting protection and support for victims, and taking a stronger enforcement approach and beefing up rehabilitation for perpetrators.The task force is chaired by Minister of State for Social and Family Development Sun Xueling and Minister of State for Home Affairs Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim.For example, it is easy to report abuse by calling the National Anti-Violence and Sexual Harassment Helpline, launched in 2021. The public can also make an online report.In 2023, the Domestic Violence Emergency Response Team (Dvert) was launched. The team, comprising social service professionals, responds to high-risk domestic violence cases with the police 24/7.Mr Martin Chok, deputy director of family and community services at Care Corner Singapore, said Dvert officers are trained to assess the situation and refer victims to help services or a crisis shelter on the spot.He said: “Without Dvert, the police may refer the case to us, but it may take a few days.”Time is of the essence if it is a high-risk case to keep the victim safe, he said.He added that the victim may change his or her mind about seeking help after a few days, when the act of violence has passed and life goes back to normal. The Women’s Charter was also amended in 2023 to boost protection for victims of family violence and to boost rehabilitation and accountability for perpetrators.These measures have a cumulative impact, which will have a deterrent effect on abusers and also encourage more victims to speak out and seek help.The message is clear: Domestic violence will not be condoned.And there is help for both the abused and the abuser to stop the violence.It all starts by breaking the silence.The Straits Times/ANN \nNepali leaders have congratulated Chinese President Xi Jinping and the people of China on China’s 75th founding anniversary.Former Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba conveyed his best wishes, stating, “Warm congratulations to President Xi Jinping and the people of China on the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China.”“Wishing continued peace, prosperity, and success. Nepal cherishes its strong friendship and looks forward to deepening our cooperation.”Similarly, former Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal expressed his congratulations: “On the auspicious occasion of the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, I extend my heartfelt congratulations and best wishes to His Excellency President Xi Jinping, the Communist Party of China, the government, and the friendly people of China.”The 75th founding anniversary marks the establishment of the People’s Republic of China on October 1, 1949. On this historic day, Mao Zedong, then chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, proclaimed the PRC’s founding at Tiananmen Square in Beijing. \nThe weather will be partly to generally cloudy in Koshi Province and Madhesh Province along with the hilly regions of rest of the country and partly cloudy to mainly fair in rest of the country on Tuesday. According to the Metrological Forecasting Division, light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is likely to occur at a few places of Koshi Province and Gandaki Province and at one or two places of Madhesh Province and Bagmati Province.Tonight, it will be partly to generally cloudy in Koshi Province, Bagmati Province and Gandaki Province along with the hilly regions of rest of the country and Partly cloudy to mainly fair in rest of the country. Light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is likely to occur at some places of Koshi Province and at a few places of the hilly region of Bagmati Province and Gandaki Province and at one or two places of hilly region of rest of the country.There is an impact of monsoon winds across the country. Nepal is experiencing a partial effect of a low-pressure system situated around Madhya Pradesh, India.On Monday, the maximum temperature was recorded at 36.4°C in Janakpur, while the lowest minimum was 9.5°C in Jomsom, with Taplejung receiving the highest rainfall of 9.5 mm in the last 24 hours. \nThe government has declared a three-day mourning after floods and landslides killed at least 209 people across the country. A Cabinet meeting on Monday evening held after Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli returned from the United States of America decided to honour the victims.Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak informed the meeting that at least 209 people have died in recent disasters, while search, rescue, rehabilitation and treatment efforts for the injured were ongoing.According to one minister, the government has pledged Rs 1 billion to the Prime Minister Disaster Relief Fund.Prime Minister Oli has instructed ministers to submit a detailed report on the loss of lives and properties by Tuesday and cost estimates for rebuilding, said the minister.The national flag will be flown at half-mast during the three days of mourning, said Minister for Communication and Information Technology Prithvi Subba Gurung, who is also the government spokesperson.Also, the meeting has decided to hand over Rs200,000 to the families of those who died in the floods and landslides. If someone has gone missing and his/her body is not found within ten days, the person will be considered as dead and the family will receive the same compensation as other victims.The government has announced free treatment for all those injured in the disaster. As many as 92 people are currently receiving treatment in various hospitals, according to the home ministry.Similarly, all ministers will contribute one month’s salary to the Prime Minister Disaster Relief Fund. The meeting also discussed restoring double lane traffic in all major highways, and curbing black marketing during the festive season.  \nThe Nepal Oil Corporation (NOC) has reduced the prices of petrol, diesel, and kerosene, with effect from Monday midnight.Under Nepal's automatic fuel pricing mechanism, the corporation adjusts prices based on the tariff received from its sole supplier, Indian Oil Corporation.A NOC board meeting decided to lower the price of petrol by Re1 per litre and diesel and kerosene by Rs2 a litre. Additionally, the price of domestic aviation fuel has been reduced by Rs6 per litre, while international aviation fuel has been cut by 45 US dollars per kilolitre.Consumers will now pay Rs158 per litre for petrol and Rs147 per litre for diesel and kerosene in Kathmandu, Pokhara, and Dipayal.In Surkhet and Dang, petrol will cost Rs157 per litre, and diesel and kerosene will be priced at Rs146 per litre. In Charaali, Biratnagar, Janakpur, Amlekhgunj, Bhalwari, Nepalgunj, Dhangadhi, and Birgunj, petrol will be priced at Rs155.50 per litre, and diesel and kerosene at Rs144.50 per litre.The corporation has announced that the prices of cooking gas cylinders will remain unchanged, despite incurring a loss of Rs269.80 per cylinder due to the revised price from IOC. \nThe death toll from the rain-triggered floods and landslides has risen to 200. The disaster, since Thursday, has devastated various parts of the country, leading to widespread destruction.According to the latest update issued at 3:30 pm on Monday by Nepal Police, 26 people are still missing while rescue operations have saved 4,222 individuals. At least 127 people have been injured in the affected areas. Rescue and relief efforts by teams from the Nepal Police, Armed Police Force, and Nepali Army are ongoing, the police said.Infrastructure damage has been extensive, with many roads blocked by landslides and floods, severely hampering transportation and rescue efforts.In a public notice issued on Monday, the police advised the public to contact local police stations before embarking on long journeys to check for potential road closures.Urging people in high-risk areas to stay alert, the police requested the public to contact the Police Control Room at 100 or the Central Police Operations Desk at 9851285635 for updates. \nThe death toll from the rain-triggered floods and landslides mainly in the central and eastern parts of Nepal has now reached 209, according to the latest figures released by the Ministry of Home Affairs on Monday evening. The disaster, which began on Thursday, continued to cause widespread destruction in multiple provinces until Sunday, leaving thousands displaced.According to the ministry at least 29 people still remain missing, while rescue teams have managed to save 4,222 individuals from the disaster-hit areas. The number of injured has also risen to 142 as rescue and relief efforts continue.The Nepal Police, Armed Police Force, and Nepali Army are working together in the ongoing rescue operations. However, efforts have been significantly hampered by damaged infrastructure, with key roads blocked due to landslides and flooding, complicating the transportation of essential supplies and aid.In an advisory issued on Monday, Nepal Police urged the public to stay vigilant, especially those residing in high-risk areas. They recommended checking with local police stations for updates on road conditions before undertaking long journeys, as many routes remain dangerous or impassable. \nAs the festive season approaches, prices of daily essentials like rice, edible oil, legumes, and lentils have increased.Retailers say food prices are expected to stay high throughout Dashain and Tihar, Nepal’s biggest festivals.In Nepal, food prices are heavily influenced by the Indian market. Even though prices have not increased in India, some opportunist traders have been taking advantage of the poor market monitoring to increase prices under different pretexts. For example, on September 14, India raised the basic import tax on crude and refined edible oils by 20 percent. Nepali importers seized this opportunity to hike their prices even though Nepal had not raised the import tax.Dhurba Prasad Adhikari, joint treasurer of the Nepal Retailers Association, said Nepali wholesalers and retailers have already raised the prices. “It has been a week since edible oil price was increased by Rs20 per litre and the price is expected to increase further as the festive demand kicks in,” he said. But he admits that market rumours and weak inspections make prices more unstable, especially during the festive season when demand is at its peak.According to the association, sunflower oil prices have increased from Rs190 to Rs210 per litre. Likewise, the per litre price of mustard oil has gone up from Rs350 to Rs370.Adhikari, who operates Adhikari Khadya Store, said the price of edible oil is expected to increase in Tihar due to high demand.Retailers said strict inspections in large trading houses could help stabilise prices during the festive season. Consumer rights activists say the current government inspections of the market are just for show and will not address issues related to price, quality, and quantity.“The government’s market inspection body is looking only at retail markets. They, too, know this will not change prices unless they also inspect the warehouses of large importers and traders,” Adhikari said. He said that the government inspecting body needs to check on the stock of goods held by traders.According to retailers, even with the new rice harvesting beginning soon, prices of the staple have increased by Rs100 kg for a 25 kg bag.Even the price of sona mansuli, which normally remains at Rs60 per kg, has now inched up to Rs70 to Rs75 per kg.Rice prices, however, are expected to decline after the arrival of the new harvest.Sugar is now being sold at Rs120 per kg and expected to rise further, retailers said.As private sector traders say they are out of sugar stock and both state supply utilities—the Salt Trading Corporation and the Food Management and Trading Company—have delayed opening the tender to import the sweetener, according to market insiders, the price is expected to cross Rs160 per kg by Tihar.However, retailers said the jeera (cumin seed) price has declined. But the price could still go up in the next two weeks.Last year during Dashain, the price of jeera, an indispensable spice, spiked from Rs1,400 to Rs1,500 per kg. The price has declined, and it is being transacted around Rs950 per kg this year, Adhikari said. Prices of lentils and legumes tend to fluctuate based on international production, but have remained high in recent months.According to the association, pulses have reached Rs180 per kg from Rs175 per kg.Adhikari said food prices have been increasing every year. “The rice prices are so high that people are buying only what they need in smaller quantities,” said Adhikari.“The government needs to intervene in the market, particularly inspect the large traders engaged in unscrupulous market activities,” said Prem Lal Maharjan, president of the National Consumer Forum. “Proper inspection will help bring the prices down. It will also help the government bring in more revenues,” he said.As the government has started operating fair-price shops across the country, there might be some relief for consumers, Maharjan said. “But such subsidised shops should be operated year-round to control market prices.”    \nDean Richard Thompson recently completed his two years as the American ambassador to Nepal. Arriving here just before the 2022 elections, he has since closely observed Nepali politics and society. Umesh Chauhan and Biswas Baral recently sat down with Thompson to reflect on his time in Nepal, major US projects in the country including those under the MCC, geopolitical competition with China, trade, and a range of other issues.How have you seen Nepali politics evolve in the two years you have been in the country? What events stood out? I’ve seen a lot of Nepali politics. Obviously, there’s been a lot of changes. I got here right before the national elections in November 2022. It was really great to see the democratic process play out here, to see Nepalis turn out in such great numbers and make their choices known.Democracy is such a vibrant and colourful exercise anywhere in the world. Nepal did not disappoint on that front. It's been fascinating to watch it evolve, to watch the governments come in different formations.What’s been great is the commitment we’ve seen from successive groups in government to moving forward and carrying forward the [bilateral] partnership and building on projects. I’ve also been amazed at some of the innovative things happening in various sectors of the economy.There has been some very exciting work in the IT sector, for example, that runs the gamut from more traditional back-office type operations to cutting-edge AI research, to developing educational apps for school students, to things like what we have been sponsoring at our Content Creator’s Mela these past two years. It is great to see Nepalis show lots of creativity in expressing themselves and talking about their culture and their society in so many different ways. Across the board, I’d say the experience has been unique.How have the Nepal-US relations evolved over the past 77 years of diplomatic ties? What are the salient features of the relationship? What I would say is we’ve always tried to listen, to engage with the Nepali society. Based on that, I think one of the things that we’ve done is refine the range of products.The Peace Corps, the USAID, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, the Development Finance Corporation, or other elements of our assistance and development commitments—these are different tools that can be employed. And Nepal has continually expanded its capacity to take advantage of them. The US has been able to increase the number of tools and assets, if you will, that Nepal can use to build its economy.I’m very proud of the fact that we have done this primarily through grant-based assistance, so that there is little in terms of downsides. At the same time, we have focused on different segments of the economy or society, for example, through the Development Finance Corporation, we’re now able to target and work with the financial sector to create more opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises, particularly women-run enterprises. Through the USAID, we can use more of the traditional mechanisms of assistance.The Millennium Challenge Corporation kind of speaks for itself. It targets large-scale, massive infrastructure type projects that aim to be transformative in terms of Nepal’s economy. It has helped grow the road and infrastructure network and show new technology that can help expand that network and make roads safer, more reliable, and easier to maintain. It has helped build an electricity infrastructure that allows Nepal, first and foremost, to internally use the green hydropower that's at its disposal, but there will be excess capacity even to export it to the region to earn additional income. So I’m pretty excited about what I’ve seen happen over the past 77 years, and where we are today. I’m also extremely positive about building on where we are now. Can you give us a status of the implementation of projects under the Millennium Challenge Account Nepal? In the MCC, energy, obviously, is a high-priority area and so is transportation. Where we are with the projects themselves is we have let out the contracts for the sub-stations, for the 18-kilometre cross-border transmission line, and we have reissued the tender for the 297-kilometre broader transmission line package that had to be revised due to some cost changes over the time it took to implement that piece of the package.But we’re pretty positive about getting that back on track by the end of the year and putting the project firmly on the right footing for a five-year completion timeline. But there have also been hurdles, right? Do you still expect the transmission lines and road projects to be completed in five years?I expect there to be more hurdles. The biggest challenge was when the bids came back for the 297-kilometre transmission line. We had a number of delays there from Covid to worldwide inflation, to supply chain shifts that I don’t think people had foreseen completely. I’m not surprised. But the MCC has had a lot of experience around the world with these projects.It builds into this assumption that there will be challenges, there will be situations that need to be rethought and overcome. The real trick is making sure we move forward in a way that’s smart and focused on keeping things on time and on track. We're fortunate in the case of Nepal because we have a partner that has so heavily invested its own resources into the project.We have our $500 million grant and Nepal is putting in almost $200 million. It’s been made a national pride project. Look, other things will inevitably come up. But we believe that we have a good team that’s ready to tackle those types of challenges and press forward.At the end of the day, this can serve as a really positive model for how development assistance and how large-scale infrastructure projects can be implemented in a partnership that is largely the result of an internal domestic process. Don’t forget, Nepal requested the MCC project. The government of Nepal, through a consultative process, developed the idea, designed the project, and is now its lead implementer.We’re a financier and a partner but it is very much a Nepal-owned effort. Talking about challenges, there are many local governments and we have to deal with them every 10 to 15 kilometres in the project areas. Different communities have different concerns and priorities. This can add to some difficulty.What do you think will happen to the project if it cannot meet the five-year deadline?The fate of the project is to be completed in its entirety in five years. I can't speak to whether there’s going to be a particular challenge to delay it by six months or seven months or something like that. Right now, in our planning and projection, we hope that we can move it forward within the timeline.If it needs to go beyond that, we’ll work closely with our partner and figure it out. I’m confident that the $500 million that the US government is providing will be spent within the five years and it will lay a firm foundation for the completion of the project.But coming back to your scenario, indeed, you have different communities. A lot of people are affected by this. Now, on the one hand, that's why we encourage and insist on a consultative process, on everything being as transparent as possible so people know exactly what’s going to happen, that they know what the money is being spent on, what the effects will be in terms of how many trees will have to be cut down or what roads will be built where. That’s very important to us: no surprises for the communities that are out there.I think that we will rely on a lot of that effort to help us propel the project forward if things do get challenging on other fronts as well.Like you said, the project does need to be completed by a deadline of five years. Just in case it doesn’t, what happens?Look, it is an ambitious undertaking. There’s no question about it, right? And the Millennium Challenge Corporation is committed to making it happen within that five-year period. The MCA Nepal is committed to making it happen within that five-year period. But they’re also working closely together to make sure that it’s being done in a proper way, in a transparent way, and I’m confident that we will be able to complete what we need to complete. I’m also sure there’s a firm commitment from the government that if there’s a little piece left over here or there, to make sure it goes forward.I don’t worry about the ultimate completion of the project. I’m more focused on how we get it going as quickly as possible, because just the implementation of the project itself should employ close to 10,000 Nepalis, right? I really want communities to start to see the benefit of the project as soon as possible, because that’s where the transformative nature of it comes into play. Part of it is building it. Part of it is implementing it. Part of it is learning from that process. But then having this infrastructure in place, that’s what really changes the dynamic in Nepal and in the economic well-being of the country.Some fear that a failure to complete the project on time could even create rifts in our bilateral ties.I don’t think they should be fearful. We are partners in this, and if there’s any issue, if we're going to work through it together. What we should be doing is focusing entirely on implementing the project to its fullest potential as quickly as possible.Let’s move to geopolitics. What we see in the region is seemingly an exclusivist India-China geopolitical competition. Indians appear reluctant to work with the regimes that work closely with China. It's almost like they are saying, it's either the Chinese or us. How do you see this geopolitical dynamics playing out in Nepal? And where do the Americans fit in this picture?Yeah, it’s a good question in terms of the dynamic that’s in play today and where things are headed. We have of course been watching the India-China relationship and its development over the past few years with some degree of concern. Obviously, there was conflict there some years ago, and I think they’ve been trying to manage that since.And there’s no question that other countries in the region feel that very powerfully. From our standpoint, what we would like to see is the countries of the region—and particularly Nepal because that’s where I’m accredited and that’s where I have some level of knowledge—exercise their sovereignty and to have the space that they need to make decisions about they own future on behalf of their people in a positive way.We don’t believe countries should be asked to choose. We fully expect that Nepal is going to have good relations with India and China. They’re two neighbours. They’re large countries. They’re important countries in the region. It’s critically important for Nepal that it works with and benefits from both India and China.At the same time, we see no reason that should have any effect on our relationship with Nepal, and no reason Nepal should not be fully able to take full advantage of what the US has to offer. We will continue to watch and continue to work closely with Nepal as a partner and to encourage it to exercise its sovereignty and its decision-making in a way that benefits the Nepali people. The US-China relations are also very dicey at the moment. Surely this has some effect on how the US perceives the Chinese role around the world, including in Nepal.We had a recent high-level visit by our National Security Advisor [to China]. We’ve had recent visits by the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Treasury. I think there’s a real effort to try to manage what we all acknowledge is as a competition that’s underway, in a way that’s positive and can maybe move us more towards some type of cooperative element.That channel should continue to be pursued by the US and China, but it’s not reflective of our relationship with Nepal, or our relationship with India. This is about what we can do together [with Nepal]. I’m not going to comment on what other countries may be saying about us, how they may be trying to influence us.I would commit to us remaining as transparent as possible so Nepalis can make their own decisions about what's happening by our relationship.Recently, the Americans were blamed for ousting Sheikh Hasina from Bangladesh. The US is also often accused of meddling in the domestic affairs of other South Asian states, and in other parts of the world for that matter. How do you respond to this accusation?First off, I think you’ve got to take with a grain of salt anything that’s being said by someone who’s been forced to flee their country. The United States simply does not meddle in the internal politics of other countries. We work very hard to be as transparent as we possibly can about our relationships, about what we’re doing, about what we intend.That’s not to say that if we disagree vehemently with a country about a certain policy or a certain issue, we won’t raise it. But this idea that the US would find some benefit in enacting a change in government like that, it simply isn’t part of our repertoire of diplomacy. What we rather look to do is build the strongest relationships that we can.We love to do that primarily through people-to-people relationships and sponsoring as much development opportunity as we possibly can with our partner countries. So, I put no stock in these types of rumours and statements.There is also this sentiment that the Americans and the Indians are increasingly working together on strategic issues, and the same is seen even in South Asia.Certainly, there’s been a huge growth in the strategic partnership between the US and India. I think we want to see that continue to move forward in a positive way. At the same time, there have been disagreements between the US and India on various fronts, just as we have disagreements with many of our partners. And we try to deal with those in a proactive, professional and productive way.But, again, we see our relationship with each individual country through a bilateral lens. So if there are ways that the US and India working together can be beneficial, and another country agrees to such a cooperation, fine. But when it comes to Nepal, we’re going to base our relationship and our efforts first and foremost on our bilateral discussions and our bilateral relationship.Even as we speak, the US and Nepali armies are undertaking joint training in Nepal. How would you characterise the relations between the two armies?Yeah, the PAC ANGEL exercise is going on, focused on disaster relief, humanitarian assistance. The relationship between the two militaries has been strong, it remains strong, and I think it will continue to be strong primarily because we focus it on the areas Nepal wants to focus on—which is building a Nepal army that is capable of responding to disasters, providing humanitarian assistance, and then serving as part of the global peacekeeping network through the United Nations as the largest contributor force of peacekeepers. It’s in our interest to see Nepal continue to professionalise and develop its capacity on those fronts. That’s where our focus is, and that’s where we will continue to make efforts.There has also been a lot of debate in Nepal on the Indo-Pacific Strategy (IPS) and its applicability to South Asia. What is the current state of its application?The Indo-Pacific Strategy is a broad, big strategy by the United States government about how it looks at the entire region. And so it’s about how we create an open, independent, sovereign Indo-Pacific region for the benefit of all the people in the region.What we will continue to do is employ it to build relationships we have with each of the countries in the region. How can we continue to support democratic development? How can we continue to support economic development? Let’s not forget a huge portion, maybe 60 percent of the world’s commerce transits the Indo-Pacific corridor in some way, shape, or form every year.It’s in everyone’s interest for that to remain open and free. And for the countries of the region to be able to act in a sovereign way in their own interests.There is also a sizable section of Nepalis who believe that the IPS was brought with the intent of countering China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), and that Nepal is struggling to find a balance between the two. What is your reading?The USAID, the MCC, the Development Finance Corporation, all of our development programmes have a singular purpose, which is to work with our bilateral partners to grow their economies, to make them more able to meet the needs of their people. That’s the goal. That's how they were designed. And that’s how we will continue to treat them.The BRI is China's initiative. It’s pushing that forward. It’s up to each country to decide how it wants to engage with others. We believe the model of, say, a USAID or an MCC is proving itself to be beneficial to countries, as they are grant-based and economic growth oriented. We’ll continue to push them because we think the data and historical experience we’ve had support them.I think it’s incumbent on us to try to help all of our partners relate to us as equals in any realm that we’re working together. That’s critically important and something we have to acknowledge and something we have to make sure that they’re able to acknowledge.It's about building trust, about showing that our intent is correct, that we have the best interest of our partners in mind, and that we’re applying the same and transparent standards universally.For example, on the MCC, we’ve published everything on the internet. If anybody in Nepal has a question about any aspect of the project, they can go to the website, they can read about the project, they can see the blueprints, they can know exactly what it’s going to involve. That's how I think we build relationships.I think if I came to Nepal and said, hey, I want to do X project because I want to counter this country, I don’t think I would get very good reception. We just don’t look at the world that way. It’s not a healthy approach in the long run.But a bilateral focus that seeks to empower the people of a country—that’s where I think we have the best chance of moving forward. Nepal’s Parliament has finally passed an amendment to the transitional justice law. How does the US see this development? How do you see the transitional justice process progressing?I think this is a really important step in the process. I would say that we remain positive about the way it's going and we are looking to see how we can help. You noted, I’m sure, that we joined a number of other partner countries in issuing a statement of support after the Parliament passed it.We all know bringing a conflict of this scale to conclusion is always going to be a challenge. The TJ legislation has passed, which was a tough hurdle, but implementation will also be difficult.We’re looking forward to figuring out how we can be supportive, and how other partners can be supportive. Some of that may be through bilateral means. Some of it may be through multilateral means.But what I remain encouraged about, in particular, is, we’ve always said this needs to be a Nepali-run process. It has been. That it needs to be victim-centric. I believe that it is. And so we need to make sure the consultative piece of this remains alive as you move to implementation, so that the victims groups, so that the child soldier groups, so that other entities that have been involved continue to have a voice and continue to work together to figure out how to resolve this, to make reparations work, to bring justice in those cases. And so, we are positive.Thousands of Nepali youths are leaving the country every single day in search of better jobs. In this light, do you see the prospect of greater American FDI helping Nepal build a more robust economy that can create enough good jobs?I do. At the beginning of the interview, I talked about some sectors of the economy that are quite exciting right now. I think you’re seeing a lot of interest from the US in the IT sector, the tourism sector, in the health sector, and in the energy sector as it continues to develop.We’re very keen to look for ways to bring more US investment here, whether it’s through equity sort of vehicles, or direct bilateral investments. I think that can also be positive. I think Nepal did a good job in setting up that April Investment Summit. That sent a really positive signal. You’ll recall that we had a representative from the US Chamber of Commerce, Atul Keshap, come out for that. We’ve had a great run of senior US visitors out here over the last year and a half.I think the key right now is for Nepal, through its private sector, through its government, to figure out how to make the environment for investment in Nepal as attractive as it can possibly be. In this interview, we’ve talked about the idea of competition between countries. One place where I will absolutely acknowledge there’s competition is in trying to attract investment.And so Nepal needs to figure out how to make itself as attractive as possible, and how to make it as easy as possible to do business. That helps not only investments that come from other countries, but makes it easier for Nepalis to start businesses, right? It makes it easier for Nepalis to operate and do what they want. And so, in addition to welcoming, say, US companies or British companies or Canadian companies, we would also love to see Nepalis who have gone abroad come back and start to help in building the economy here.We’ve seen how capable and how dynamic they are in building other people’s economies. Let’s do the same here at home.I mentioned that the trade and investment framework talks that we have with Nepal are in their seventh round. I look forward to, in the rest of my tenure here, to continue to build the momentum that will allow investment to take shape and the economy here to thrive. \nHere’s what Prime Minister KP Oli told the parliament on Monday, saying he was giving the address for a “special” reason: “Nepal wants to maintain neighbourly relations as a good neighbour, not a petty, scheming neighbour…Nepal wants a similar behaviour on the part of its neighbours.”He pursued this line of argument, implying that India is wishing ill on Nepal, imposing on Nepal’s sovereignty and interfering in its independent status and policy. He then told the parliament that he would present the issue at the United Nations General Assembly.It basically amounts to saying he will complain to the UN about India’s behaviour. What a petty idea.Given his inherent character trait, PM Oli will find it difficult to develop trusted relations with India in the short term. His only option is to be diplomatic, predictable and consistent. So far, he’s not been able to do that. It does not bode well for Nepal’s foreign policy, which is the most important means of pursuing Nepal’s current priorities, including jobs, growth and climate change.Calculated relations Oli’s statement in the parliament indicates at least three things. First, his expectations from India have not been fulfilled. Second, his communications with the country have broken down. And third, he thinks India may be working to undermine his political authority.Let’s look at his expectations from the southern neighbour. Oli wants to hold high-level talks with PM Modi of India and build trusted relations.In the past two weeks, media reports and opinion pieces have discussed whether Oli would be invited to India or not. It has almost become customary in Nepal for a new prime minister to visit India first before embarking on other high-level visits. Such a custom indicates the value politicians accord to India, especially if they want their government to be stable.The second indication is that Oli is finding it difficult to communicate with people who matter in India. When you begin to communicate your feelings about India through the media, it indicates that your direct communications have either broken down or are ineffective.Behind Oli’s statement is an obvious intention to play the blame game or rally the public. India may be at fault for many things, but blaming India does not absolve him of inconsistencies on his part or the sheer inability to conduct diplomacy in a dignified manner.The third indication is even more significant. Oli has consistently promoted anti-Indian nationalism, and India finds it difficult to trust him. But would that alone be enough to undermine his government?Throughout history, India has had a significant influence on Nepal’s political process and decision-making. Through its influence on individuals who’ve received gifts, benefits, and resources, some at the highest levels, India holds significant leverage over political decision-making and, by extension, over policies and processes.An old playbookIndia’s calculated relations with the Nepali state came to the fore in August this year when Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba visited India. New Delhi turned her visit into a high-profile affair even though she was unprepared to represent Nepal’s interests. Her visit, rather than building political trust, ended up creating more mistrust between Oli and New Delhi as well as between the Foreign Ministry and the Prime Minister’s Office.Although it is a matter of speculation, there are strong grounds to argue that such a courtesy would not have been extended to someone from the CPN (UML). It generates the question, at least in the public’s mind, whether India accorded special treatment to FM Rana as a “special” individual who happened to be the foreign minister and not as a representative of Nepal.Whether real or not, the perception that India is unhappy with Oli has fuelled the notion that the current government coalition is unstable.Throughout Nepal’s modern history, whenever top leaders are forced out, they tend to seek India’s support to regain power. I have heard firsthand from top political leaders that India used to put a pre-condition: First, demonstrate that you have people's support, then we will use our leverage to help you. Thus, the political leaders would launch a political campaign and hold mass meetings throughout the country. If the broader political environment favoured a political change, then India made the additional push.Now, as Pushpa Kamal Dahal tours the country, blaming a corrupt network of power brokers, we are reminded of this old playbook. During mass meetings, an embittered Dahal frequently alleges that “middlemen, brokers, and big cronies have gotten together, and with the strength of so-called numbers, have tried to strangle truth, justice…and good governance.” He also tells the public that his government was ousted because the investigations on corruption were leading to Budhanilkantha (Deuba’s residence) and Balkot (Oli’s residence).Oli’s inherent anti-Indian streakFor Oli, an inherent anti-Indian streak in his psychological make-up and an affinity with the Communist Party of China makes rapprochement with India difficult.In the last 10 years, Oli has made countless petty statements intended to rile and irritate India. He has also accorded China greater space in Nepal.In his book, former deputy PM Kamal Thapa expresses distaste at the way Oli made an unscheduled visit to China Gezhouba Group Corporation and disappeared for one and a half hours for a private meeting with Chinese Communist Party officials during his visit to China in 2016.Another issue is the Eminent Persons’ Group report, which Oli raised during the launch of Thapa’s book. “It would be good to receive the report,” he said during the programme. He made more anti-Indian remarks at another similar event.At present, any talk of the EPG report is viewed as an irritant by India, because it has consistently sent a clear diplomatic message that the report is dead. The unwillingness of a section of the Nepali populace to accept the message, including the CPN-UML, has not gone well in India.In a recent discussion programme, a former ambassador of India to Nepal indicated that the EPG report had become a new irritant in Nepal-India relations. He said that instead of insisting on the acceptance of the report, Nepal could pursue the individual issues identified. Trends in the last two decades indicate that instead of really trying to address the outstanding issues in Nepal-India relations, Nepali leaders are just interested in politicising them and gaining personal mileage.Nepal’s relationship with India has become more and more of a paradox. Nepal’s dominant ethno-nationalism is anti-Indian. Indeed, Nepal has many unresolved issues with India, but it’s economic development hinges on closer connectivity with India, which in turn hinges on trusted political relationships and ability to untangle complex issues.Snubbed by India, Oli is now headed to the US, where he could still get to meet a lukewarm Modi. He hopes to gain stature and make an impression at several forums including the UNGA, where he is scheduled to deliver speeches. We can only wish our PM well. \nFive years ago, on September 30, 2019, when KP Sharma Oli was prime minister for the second time, the government declared the entire country open-defecation free amid much fanfare. However, years later, thousands of people from across the country are getting infected with diarrheal diseases, including scores from cholera.Rautahat is among the nine districts reporting cholera outbreaks this year. Ward 4 of Rajpur Municipality has reported over 100 cases of diarrheal infection and hospitalisation. However, the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division said only 12 people from the municipality had so far contracted cholera.“Over 100 diarrheal patients from the municipality’s ward 4 have been hospitalised,” Khusid Ahmad, a health worker at the municipality, told the Post over the phone from Rautahat. “Contaminated drinking water could be the culprit for the cholera outbreak there. Samples of drinking water collected from affected areas have been sent for lab tests.”Apart from Rautahat, eight other districts—Lalitpur, Kathmandu, Kailali, Pyuthan, Makawanpur, Rolpa, Sindhupalchok, and Achham—have also reported cholera outbreaks this year. So far, the number of diarrheal patients who have contracted cholera is 95. Interestingly, most of the districts that have witnessed outbreaks of deadly cholera this year had years ago been declared open defecation-free.The Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool samples of the infected patients. Doctors say that detected cases of cholera infection could be just the tip of the iceberg, as most positive cases are being reported from the districts with active surveillance.Public health experts say outbreaks of cholera in multiple districts, even five years after the country was declared open defecation-free, show a huge gap between official declarations and progress on the ground.They say outbreaks of diarrheal diseases, including cholera, are directly linked to drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene conditions, and the country was declared open defecation-free without improving water and sanitation conditions.“Without ensuring the quality of drinking water and sanitation, among other things, authorities rushed to declare the entire country free from open defecation,” said Dr Mingmar Gyelgen Sherpa, former director general at the Department of Health Services. “Instead of improving basic water and sanitation infrastructure, we’ve focussed too much on outbreak management, and this is the wrong approach.”Even though toilets have been built in most households, open defecation is still widespread in many places. Drinking water samples collected from various parts of the country, including from the districts of the Kathmandu Valley, have been found contaminated with faecal coliform, which means the water the public uses for drinking is unsafe. The presence of faecal coliform, a microscopic organism that thrives in the intestines of warm-blooded animals or their faeces, indicates sewage contamination in the drinking water, according to doctors.A previous study had shown that 81 percent of water samples collected in the Kathmandu Valley were contaminated with deadly microbes.“We only focussed on expanding coverage of drinking water but did not pay attention to ensuring its safety,” said Dr Meghnath Dhimal, chief researcher at the Nepal Health Research Council. “Authorities concerned must also focus on improving the quality.”Experts say improving public hygiene is essential to ensuring water quality and avoiding diarrheal ailments. Awareness drives and health education play a crucial role in changing behaviours, which requires years of investment and continuous efforts.Along with investment in health education, attention should go to building climate-resilient infrastructures for drinking water and sanitation, as water resources have been contaminated by floodwaters in many districts. The effects of climate change have increased adverse events, including floods, which in turn have contaminated the source of drinking water, making people vulnerable to infection with diarrheal ailments.“Multiple agencies of the three tiers of government and non-governmental sectors have to make more effort to prevent diarrhoea outbreaks,” said Sherpa. “But there seems to be a lack of coordination among government agencies.” The World Health Organisation also stresses on a multifaceted approach as a key to controlling cholera and reducing deaths. \nRae was the envoy to Kathmandu during the promulgation of the 2015 constitution and the subsequent blockade. In this conversation, Rae talks about the evolution of Nepal-India ties since the blockade, regional geopolitics, what the two countries get wrong about each other, how New Delhi views Nepali communist parties and the governments they lead, and the change (if any) in India’s neighbourhood policy since the start of Narendra Modi’s third term in office. \nKunwar has been the MD for just under three years. Before coming back to her homeland to join Daraz Nepal, she worked at different American companies, including Amazon, the world’s biggest e-commerce platform. In this conversation, Kunwar talks about the opportunities and challenges of running an e-commerce enterprise in Nepal, as well as the country’s overall business environment.  \nWhen the Ranjitkar group was established, they discovered this forgotten dance and devoted two years to researching it.Now, they are reintroducing it during Indra Jatra by training the new generation in this traditional art form. \nHe is known for his nationalist legacy, marked by the amendment of Nepal's map to include territories like Kalapani, Lipulekh, and Limpiyadhura, and his strong stance against India, especially during and after the 2015 Nepal blockade.But how did he rise to become the country's powerful man? \nThe Nepali Congress is holding a ‘100-day campaign’ to rejuvenate party committees, strengthen the bond between the party's local representatives and central leaders, and pacify the party's dissenters.The party’s central committee meeting, which concluded on September 1, decided to run the 100-day campaign from September 23 to December 31. Krishna Prasad Paudel, chief secretary at the party office, says many central leaders have already reached the districts they are assigned to run campaign activities.According to Paudel, the party’s seven joint general secretaries lead the campaign in the seven provinces. Senior leaders Krishna Sitaula, Shashank Koirala, Bimalendra Nidhi, and Bijaya Kumar Gachhadar, along with some central committee leaders, have either reached the assigned districts or are on the way, Paudel said.“When the party’s senior leaders and central committee members are in their districts, vice presidents and general secretaries of the party will monitor the campaign activities,” Paudel told the Post. “If necessary, the vice presidents, the general secretaries, and the party president will go to some districts.”One of the main objectives of the campaign is to renew party membership. “We claim our party has 0.9 million members,” Paudel said. “During the campaign, leaders will check the trend of party members renewing their membership.”The campaign has been launched at a time when leaders have already started to devise their plans for the next general convention. As per the Congress statute, the party must hold its general convention every four years. The party’s 14th general convention was held in December 2021. If the statute is followed, the party’s next convention should be convened by the end of 2025.Some Congress leaders have floated the proposal of contesting the next general election on its own, without forging electoral alliance with other parties. General Secretary Gagan Thapa floated a proposal to this effect at the Mahasamiti meeting in February that forwarded the proposal to the central committee to take a decision on the issue.“If we are to fight elections on our own [without an alliance], we need a strong organisation, therefore the party is emphasising strengthening the party by conducting campaigns,” Paudel told the Post.But, for the party leaders, success of the campaign will largely depend on the way it will be run.“Will the party leaders try to connect the party organisation to the public or will they conduct it in just a traditional manner? This will determine the success of the campaign,” Guru Ghimire, a Congress leader, told the Post.Ghimire suggested that the party leaders should also gauge the strengths and weaknesses of other parties in the districts.Ghimire also advised the leaders not to use the campaign as an opportunity to promote factional activities.When public disenchantment towards the major parties is growing fast, the campaign the Congress has decided to carry forward could be a means to connect the leaders with the public, says a Congress leader.“This campaign will re-energise the relations between the party and the public, and the party should work hard to make this event fruitful without baggage of internal factions,” Sanjay Kumar Gautam, a Congress lawmaker, told the Post.Reconnecting with the public is a compulsion for the political parties, say political experts. Soon after the November 2022 election, major political parties including the Congress held several campaigns to reconnect with the people but the masses may not be quite impressed by the leaders’ announcements they make during the rallies unless they deliver when in power. Earlier, the CPN-UML carried out various drives such as ‘mission grassroots’, a march along Mid-Hill Highway. “Political parties’ efforts to get connected with the people is something commendable in itself,” Geja Sharma Wagle, a political analyst close to the Congress, told the Post. “But, if the political parties don’t deliver while they are in government, people might not be convinced by their pledges.”Wagle adds that as the Congress is in government, people take the leaders’ speeches seriously only if they work for them sincerely.During the 100-day campaign, the party has decided to inform the party members and local leaders regarding the seven-point agreement reached between the Congress and the CPN-UML on July 1. Based on the same agreement, the two parties formed the coalition government led by UML chair KP Sharma Oli on July 15. As per the deal, Oli will hand over the government leadership to Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba after two years.Besides their power-sharing in the federal government, the Congress and the UML have shared powers in provincial governments as well. While Koshi, Lumbini and Karnali provincial governments are led by the UML, Congress provincial lawmakers head Bagmati, Gandaki, and Sudurpaschim governments. The two big parties have backed Janamat Party to head the provincial government in Madhesh.During a meeting of the coalition partners held in Singha Durbar on September 9, Prime Minister Oli had reportedly complained that the coalition partners did not work enough to counter the ‘disinformation campaign of the opposition parties’ against the Oli government. “The opposition has spread confusion about the government, but the parties in government have not shown any interest in countering the disinformation,” the prime minister had reportedly said at the meeting. “All the ruling partners should defend the government.”Congress leaders will inform the party’s district representatives about the spirit of collaboration with the UML, constitutional amendments, and other issues. They are also responsible for informing the party members at the grassroots about policies such as the common minimum programme.Earlier this month, the Congress-UML coalition brought the programme that has, among other things, reiterated its commitment to reviewing the achievements made and weaknesses observed in the course of implementing the constitution in the past nine years. \nAfter being ousted from government for the first time in nine years, the CPN (Maoist Centre) appears to be at a turning point as it seeks to redefine its vision of socialism. In the wake of consultative meetings in seven provinces and its foreign units, party leaders have stressed the need for fresh ideas based on the party’s historic Chunwang meeting of 2005 that adopted ‘democratic republicanism’.Until this July, the party has continuously been in power since the promulgation of the constitution in 2015. Back during the insurgency days, the meeting held at Chunwang in Rukum district had endorsed the party’s political line advocating for promulgating a constitution through a constituent assembly. On this basis, the party in 2006 signed the Comprehensive Peace Accord with the then seven-party alliance and laid down arms to enter mainstream politics.The 2015 constitution envisions Nepal as a socialism-oriented country, with the Maoist Centre playing a key role in shaping that direction. But why, after all these years, is the party revisiting the question of socialism?Maoist Centre spokesman, Agni Sapkota, argues that the party has been discussing socialism in various forums. “But this time, we want a more intense and focussed discussion.” Tensions within the party also came to light during the party’s standing committee meeting in August where office bearers openly questioned the leadership of Pushpa Kamal Dahal. In response, the party decided to hold consultative meetings in all provinces to discuss the matter. Besides the provincial meetings, the party also consulted its foreign branches known as ‘pradesh committees’ in India, West Asia, and Eurasia.According to Sapkota, the Maoist Centre leadership got three mandates at the consultative meetings that concluded on September 20.“Besides the need for discussion on party ideology, the consultative meetings’ mandates include improving organisational management and updating party statute, changing leaders’ behaviour, and improving their secretariat work,” Sapkota told the Post. Likewise, another party leader, Dor Prasad Upadhyaya, says democratic socialism naturally aligns with the ideology of the Nepali Congress, whereas ‘people’s multiparty democracy’ is the ideology of the CPN-UML. “As for the Maoist Center, we lack a distinct political ideology clearly reflecting the party’s vision.”Although the party claims its ideology is ‘people’s democracy of the 21st century’, party leaders admit that its impact is diluted by lack of commitment. Party leaders said that there was no call for a leadership change during the consultative meetings. However, at the standing committee meeting in August, a deputy general secretary of the party, Janardan Sharma, submitted a 14-page document calling for a change in party leadership.Sharma and Barsha Man Pun—another deputy general secretary of the Maoist party—urged Dahal to pass over party reins to new generation leaders. According to leaders, some within the party feel that Dahal should not leave a leadership vacuum until a clear plan for leadership transition is in place.Likewise, Ram Karki, the party’s secretary, says the consultative meetings were focussed at preparing a political document that would be presented at the central committee meeting in November. “The consultative meetings were focused on the party’s diminishing influence in national politics,” Karki told the Post. “Despite our party leaders who were in government claiming that they did an excellent job, why hasn’t that reflected in the party’s life? This was a major concern expressed during the meetings.”Karki said the meeting also directed the party to remain open for cooperation with other parties with socialist inclinations. When asked about possible cooperation with the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), Karki dismissed the idea. “Lately, there have been some points of agreement between the two parties. But, I don’t see any prospect of the two parties getting into a working partnership,” Karki said. “The consultative meetings have said the party leadership is open to cooperation with socialist parties except the RSP.”The RSP—which was one of the junior partners in the immediate past government led by Maoist Centre chief Dahal before the government was toppled on July 12—appears to be on the same page with the Maoist Centre on many issues lately. But the two parties rule out cooperation on the political front.Party spokesperson Sapkota also says that his party can cooperate with the RSP in parliament on issues of public interest, but there is no possibility of forging a working alliance with the party. RSP chair Rabi Lamichhane, who presented his political document at the party's first national conference held for two days in Kathmandu earlier this month, also hinted at potential cooperation with like-minded parties. Despite this, RSP leaders declined cooperation with the Maoist Centre. The Maoist Centre’s consultative meetings have suggested that the party consider unification with other parties in order to revitalise the communist movement, Sapkota added.  \nThe Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), the fourth largest in Parliament, is fiercely resisting what it claims are government moves to arrest its chair, Rabi Lamichhane, over allegations of his involvement in cooperatives fraud. But all the other national parties seem to be in favour of his prosecution. Among the seven national parties in Parliament, there is a growing consensus for holding Lamichhane accountable. A party needs to win at least one FPTP seat and get three percent proportional representation votes to get national party status.Ruling coalition partners such as the Nepali Congress, the CPN-UML, Ashok Rai’s Janata Samajbadi Party, and the Janamat Party believe that RSP chair Lamichhane should face the law. Additionally, the CPN (Maoist Centre), the main opposition in Parliament, along with the Rastriya Prajantra Party and Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal (JSP-Nepal), both of which are outside the coalition, also support the parliamentary probe’s findings and advocate action against Lamichhane. The CPN (Unified Socialist), which is not a national party but has 10 seats in the lower house, has also joined the ranks of parties that want Lamichhane prosecuted. “Our party believes that, as a matter of principle, no innocent should be punished, and no guilty evade the law,” says the Maoist Centre Secretary Devendra Paudel.On the probe panel’s findings, Paudel said, “Evidence suggests that Lamichhane misused cooperative funds,” Paudel told the Post. “He should be held accountable for his actions as per the law.” A source close to Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak while talking to the Post said, “If everything goes as planned, the police will arrest Lamichhane soon.”However, during a recent interview with Kantipur Television’s Fireside program, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the chairman of the Maoist Centre, was noncommittal on whether Lamichhane should be prosecuted for misusing cooperative funds.But party secretary Paudel said his party would take a stand against Lamichhane’s misuse of cooperative funds.Unified Socialist spokesperson Jagannath Khatiwada says that the probe panel’s recommendations should be implemented. “Although our party has yet to take an official position on it, I can say that our leaders are discussing the parliamentary probe report and there is a general consensus that the report’s recommendations should be implemented.”“The report suggests that the government should further investigate and prosecute four key people [Rabi Lamichhane, GB Rai, Chhabi Joshi, and Kumar Ramtel] involved in the misuse of multiple cooperative funds, and our party supports the report,” Khatiwada told the Post. “Those proven guilty should be booked under the prevailing laws.” While Rai is on the run, Ramtel is in judicial custody of Kaski police. After arresting Joshi, Police are now waiting for the government’s green light to arrest Lamichhane, who has twice served as deputy prime minister and home minister.The Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal (JSP-Nepal), led by Upendra Yadav, also views Lamichhane as culpable in the misuse of the cooperative funds and disputes the RSP’s claim that he got a clean chit from the parliamentary special probe. “Our party does not want to disrespect any political leaders as such, but that does not mean a guilty individual should escape legal repercussions,” Manish Kumar Suman, the party central spokesperson, told the Post. “The report clearly indicates Lamichhane’s involvement in misusing cooperative funds, so there is no question of him getting a clear chit, unlike what the RSP leaders claim.” Rastriya Prajatantra Party Vice President Dhruba Bahadur Pradhan says the parliamentary probe panel, which investigated crisis-ridden cooperatives, has done its job and submitted a report and now it is the government’s responsibility to act on the recommendations.“As for our party’s position, Lamichhane should be prosecuted under the prevailing laws, as per the special committee’s report,” Pradhan told the Post. Lamichhane is accused of siphoning funds from multiple cooperatives to run the Gorkha Media Network, which operated the Galaxy 4k Television channel. The channel shut down last year. Chairman GB (Gitendra Babu) Rai and managing director Lamichhane jointly ran the media company before Lamichhane quit it to join politics in June 2022. On September 16, the parliamentary special committee submitted its report to Speaker Ghimire, who forwarded it to the government on the same day. On September 19, the Cabinet owned the report and ordered responsible ministries to act based on its findings. The probe panel’s report does not directly implicate Lamichhane in rerouting cooperative funds into the media, but it does label him guilty of using cooperative funds for Gorkha Media Network. The panel has recommended that the government prosecute Lamichhane; his business partner Rai; one of the founders of Gorkha Media Company, Chhabi Joshi; and board member Kumar Ramtel. As the panel report could not establish a direct link between Lamichhane and the rerouting of cooperative funds, RSP leaders interpret it as a ‘clean chit’ for their party chief. But leaders from other parties reject this claim.“The way RSP leaders are trying to interpret the probe panel’s report is distortion,” Pradhan said.Based on the report, the crime division of Nepal Police arrested Joshi, former deputy inspector general of Nepal Police and one of the founders of Gorkha Media Network, on the orders of Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak on Sunday. Following this, RSP chair Lamichhane organised a gathering of party sympathisers at his office to condemn the government amid rumours of his impending arrest. While addressing supporters at the RSP headquarters in Balaju, Kathmandu on Sunday evening, he urged them to be prepared to defend their new political force, claiming that a plan was afoot to ‘finish Rabi Lamichhane and the Rastriya Swatantra Party.’The erstwhile main opposition party, Nepali Congress, had continuously disrupted the parliamentary proceedings for over two months demanding a probe into the cooperatives scam, especially its connections to the Gorkha Media Network. In response, the immediate past government led by Maoist Centre chair Dahal had formed the parliamentary special probe panel.  \nRepresentatives at the first national conference of the Rastriya Swatantra Party saw factionalism within the party.Some of the representatives who arrived in Kathmandu three days ago for the two-day gathering starting on Tuesday said that growing factionalism is not healthy for the new political outfit promising to challenge traditional forces like the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML.“We were told that factionalism existed in our party in various forms, but we denied such claims. However, during our three days in Kathmandu, we witnessed it,” a group of party members told the Post. It seems that President Rabi Lamichhane and Vice-president Swarnim Wagle are not in the same boat on how the party should function, they added.RSP acting spokesperson Manish Jha explains that it is the lack of synchronisation—rather than differences—between the leaders. “People from various schools of thought came together to form the RSP. It is true that we lack synchronisation, but it would be wrong to portray it as differences.”Another leader of the party said on condition of anonymity that the party has two schools of thought—one based on democratic principles and the other opposed to it.RSP acting general secretary Kabindra Burlakoti claims that the party is united.In conversations with the Post, representatives from Kathmandu Valley, Pokhara and Chitwan sounded more optimistic with the central leadership while those from remote areas were confused over their take on the party’s central leadership.The representatives from Madhesh were mild in their opinion about the leadership.Moreover, representatives were also not very positive about the way the central leadership is investing their energy to claim that Lamichhane had got a clean chit from the parliamentary special committee formed to investigate crisis-ridden cooperatives.The probe panel, which submitted its report to the House of Representatives, has recommended the government prosecute Lamichhane, along with his former business partner GB (Gitendra Babu) Rai, board member of the media Kumar Ramtel and initial founder Chhabi Lal Joshi as per the prevailing laws. The inquiry committee, however, has said it couldn’t establish Lamichhane’s role in rerouting the cooperatives fund to Gorkha Media Network.“It would have been better had the central leadership waited to see how the government would take action,” the group of representatives from western Nepal told the Post. “In case Lamichhane is booked under the law, it could be counterproductive for the party in the long run.”The political campaign started by the RSP won’t get stalled even without Lamichhane, the representatives said, expressing their confidence in the party’s longevity.Lamichhane also presented a political report incorporating proposed statutory changes, the party’s commitments to voters, policy agenda presented by Swarnim Wagle at the Jaleshwar meeting and the conclusion drawn from the closed session of the national conference.Lamichhane’s report states that the policy paper presented in Jaleshwar defined ‘constitutional socialism’ as the party’s political ideology. Lamichhane also accuses the ruling Nepali Congress and CPN-UML of trying to lead the country to a two-party system by polarising smaller parties. “On the pretext of administrative reform, they are planning to wipe out the existence of small parties,” the report reads. “Potentially, this step can bring together new parties that want to be an alternative political force sooner or later.”Asked about RSP’s possible alliance with other parties, Burlakoti said though they are not in talks with the main opposition CPN (Maoist Centre), they are in regular contact with several independent candidates of last election.Asked if they are in discussion with Kathmandu Metropolitan City Mayor Balendra Shah, who won the 2022 local election independently, Burlakoti said: “Strategic moves are not to be disclosed.”However, when the national conference concluded after Lamichhane presented his report, representatives arriving from around the country were displeased.“This is not the way a party functions,” a representative told the Post, asking not to be named for fears of reprisal.When leaders put themselves at the centre and cadres in the periphery, the party’s downfall begins, another representative said. Acting General Secretary Burlakoti, however, defended the party leadership. “Our national conference was designed this way,” Burlakoti said. The report presented by the chair will be discussed in the party’s Mahakali-Mechi campaign that will start soon, he added.“At the national conference, we gave 5 percent of the total representatives (1500) time to speak, but those who spoke exceeded that number,” Burlakoti said.The conference, however, passed Lamichhane’s report. On Wednesday, Lamichhane announced the date of the party’s first general convention. It will be held on May 8-10 at a yet-undecided venue.“I would like to inform you that the Central Committee has become the general convention organising committee,” Burlakoti said. Lamichhane also announced the ‘Mahakali-Mechi Campaign’ to interact with the general public.In his report, Lamichhane has proposed a person not affiliated to any party to be elected the country’s president, directly elected executive head, or the prime minister. He also proposes giving the nation’s vice president the responsibility to chair the National Assembly.While the paper bats for a fully proportional electoral system, it says provincial assemblies cannot be accepted in the current shape.However, this does not mean the RSP is against the federal structure gained through the sacrifice of thousands of people, another representative said. “Our party has no strength to amend the constitution and scrap the federal structure. Therefore, for the time being, voices are growing among the party members about accepting the present political structure,” Khemraj Koirala, a conference representative from Kailali told the Post.Party members also suggested downsizing the number of ministers to make the provincial system functional, Koirala said.The report also stands for reducing the number of municipalities to less than 500, from the current 753. \nCPN-UML and Nepali Congress pledge constitutional amendments based on review of past performance, prioritizing political stability and protection of constitutional pillars, with commitments in various sectors including economic development, social justice, transitional justice, and cooperative regulation.\nTicket bookings for Dashain public transport, expected to serve 2 million travellers leaving Kathmandu, open this Saturday with online and counter options amid safety measures.\nA pressure cooker suspected as a bomb was found in front of Balambu Secondary School in Chandragiri Municipality, Kathmandu, causing panic and prompting a bomb disposal team from the Nepal Army to safely dispose of the object.\nKathmandu Metropolitan City has prohibited construction within 40 meters of both sides of rivers, based on a Supreme Court verdict, also banning sewage disposal and mandating groundwater recharge measures.\nAfter a century-long hiatus due to the 1934 earthquake, the Ranjitkar Group has revived the Ranjitkar Lakhe dance in Bhaktapur, engaging youth in the preservation of their cultural heritage.\nThe Lions Club of Kathmandu Corporate, Nepal MD325-D has felicitated various personalities as part of its endeavour to recognise the contribution of the individuals and business entities for the society.As part of its campaign, the Lions Club of Kathmandu honoured Prateek Pradhan with Social Journalism Award, Sylapa T Rimponche with Social Spiritual Award, Erika Gurung with Social Player Award, Ramesh Corporation with Social Corporate House Award, Rajendra Malla with Social Corporate Leader Award and Rajesh Hamal with Social Celebrity Award.Likewise, Chandra Ghimire is honoured with Social Bureaucratic Award, Binod Das with Sports Management Award, Anil Kedia with Social Academic Award, Mohan Ojha with Social Management Award and Surya Nepal with Corporate Social Responsibility Award.The Lionism embarked in Nepal in 1971 as the Lions Club of Biratnagar under the stewardship of former Prime Minister Matrika Prasad Koirala.The Lions Clubs International says it has over 2,000 clubs operating across the nation. \nPeter England, a leading international menswear brand from the house of Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail Ltd., has opened its new flagship store in Kathmandu. With this new launch, the brand aims to enhance its presence further and cater to the growing demand for lifestyle products by offering premium-quality choices to men across the country, the company said in a statement.Founded in 1889 in Ireland, Peter England is India’s largest menswear brand. Spanning 750 sq ft, the new store offers a comprehensive selection of shirts, T-shirts, trousers, denim, occasion wear like suits, blazers, and loungewear, along with accessories like belts, ties, and handkerchiefs designed to meet the diverse needs of modern consumers. Commenting on the launch, Anil S Kumar, chief operating officer of Peter England, said, “We are happy to expand our presence in Nepal by launching our third store in Kathmandu, the nation's capital and the largest city. Peter England has always been synonymous with trust, quality, and affordability, and we are excited to offer our customers an elevated shopping experience.” \nBeanstalk Asia Nepal, Water Communication, and Nepal Traveller hosted a two-day Nepal Hospitality Conclave in Kathmandu.The event brought together key stakeholders to discuss challenges, opportunities, and strategies in the tourism industry. Supported by Hotel Association Nepal, this Hospitality Conclave was hosted in line with Nepal’s declaration of 2025 as a ‘Special Tourism Year’ and the ‘Nepal Tourism Decade.’ To capture and embrace the spirit of this tourism decade, the Conclave featured over 20 national and international panellists speaking on important tourism topics to maximise Nepal’s tourism potential, including marketing and promotion, destination development, investment, and policy reforms needed for tourism prosperity. This event was supported by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Trade and Competitiveness and over a dozen national and multinational private firms. In her remarks, USAID Nepal’s Deputy Mission Director, Karen Welch, said, “USAID remains deeply committed to strengthening Nepal’s tourism sector through collaboration with the government of Nepal, local communities, and businesses like yours.” \nThe International Balloon Festival will be held in Pokhara, with 30 countries participating. Nepal Balloon Pvt Ltd will organise the festival from December 24 to January 1, coinciding with Christmas and the New Year.The festival will cover a stretch of three kilometres, from Lauruk in Pokhara to Chankhapur in Pame.Bikram Bade, president of Nepal Balloon, said that preparations are underway for the first-ever festival of its kind in Nepal.According to Bade, the festival will feature 30 commercial balloon companies from around the world, including Nepal. \"The festival aims to promote tourism in Pokhara and Nepal at the international level, while also advancing adventure tourism,\" said Bade. He added that the festival is expected to attract more domestic and foreign tourists, helping to revitalise Nepal’s tourism sector post-Covid.Bade expressed optimism that the festival would add a new dimension to Pokhara's tourism and boost tourism activities in the region. He emphasised that the event will be instrumental in reactivating the tourism sector, which has slowed down due to the pandemic, and in attracting a new wave of domestic and foreign visitors.Dhanraj Acharya, mayor of Pokhara Metropolitan City, expressed his enthusiasm for the festival, stating that it is a welcome addition to Pokhara’s tourism calendar. He pledged his support as a protector and promoter of similar events in the city.BB Dhakal, director of Nepal Balloon, said Pokhara, rich in natural resources, has been evolving into an adventure tourism destination. \"In this context, the balloon festival will help solidify Pokhara's reputation as an adventure tourism hub.”The concept of international balloon festivals isn't new. The Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta, first held in the US in 1972, sees about 500 hot air balloons flying annually in New Mexico, attracting over a million tourists. Other notable festivals include the Bristol International Balloon Fiesta in England, the Saga International Balloon Fiesta in Japan, the Mondial Air Balloons Event in France, and the Cappadocia International Balloon Festival in Turkey.During the Pokhara festival, professional pilots representing different countries will fly hot air balloons daily—in the morning, afternoon, and the evening. The festival will see around 500 commercial flights and is expected to host around 3,000 passengers, along with 300 non-commercial flights.The organiser said a mini balloon show will also be organised, with performances by renowned national and local artists. Traditional Nepali cultural exhibitions and displays from other countries will be featured. Attendees can also enjoy local food stalls and various entertainment activities.The organisers estimate that Rs68.3 million will be spent on the festival, which is expected to boost Pokhara's post-pandemic tourism recovery.Hot air balloon flights typically last around 40 minutes, offering a panoramic view of the Pokhara valley, including the majestic snow-capped ranges of Annapurna, Machhapuchhre, and Dhaulagiri. In addition to the stunning sunrise and sunset views, the festival will feature night balloon glows, daily 20-minute fireworks displays, balloon races, concerts, various games, food courts, cultural dances, DJ music, and night camps.Balloon Nepal, established in 2016, has been operating commercial hot air balloon flights in Pokhara since 2018. The company recently participated in the February International Balloon Fiesta, 2024, held in Thailand. \nThe severe flooding and landslides that Nepal has faced for the last few days have pushed food and vegetable prices up in Kathmandu, as roads connecting the Valley have been obstructed since Saturday.Traders say that delays in opening the highways could push the prices of foods and vegetables further.In the Capital, the record rainfall in 54 years inundated most of the warehouses of essential food items, traders said. The fruits and vegetable market in Balkhu has been flooded, while the Kalimati market was partially affected.Traders say that the supply of food and fresh vegetables dropped sharply, particularly from Dhading and Kavre, the key source districts to Kathmandu, as landslides have blocked highways.The lifeline for Kathmandu has been severed since Saturday with the Tribhuvan and Prithvi highways being blocked.The BP Highway linking Kathmandu with eastern Tarai has also been blocked. Kalimati, which houses the country’s largest fruits and vegetables market, received 156 tonnes of vegetables on Saturday, down nearly a fourth from 571 tonnes on Friday.“There is a supply constraint due to landslides in most of the highways connecting Kathmandu. As a result of low supply and high demand, prices of vegetables have increased,” said Binay Shrestha, information officer at the Kalimati Fruits and Vegetable Market Development Board.“Today [Sunday], we received only 38 tonnes of vegetables till 4:00 pm. These vegetables are from the Valley, produced on tunnel farms.”However, tunnel farming has also been largely affected by the floods. Shrestha said that as soon as the highways are cleared, supply will become normal.The wholesale price of most of the seasonal green vegetables has crossed the Rs100 per kg mark.According to the board's wholesale price index, the big price of tomatoes increased by 29.41 percent to Rs110 per kg, the price of cowpeas jumped by 46.67 percent to Rs110 per kg, the bitter gourd price increased by 69.23 percent to Rs110 per kg, and the smooth gourd price increased by 80 percent to Rs135 per kg.Potato price increased by 7.25 percent to Rs74 per kg. Other vegetables like tomato (local and tunnel), onion, carrot, cabbage, cauli local, French bean, bottle gourd, squash, green leafy vegetables, mushroom, cucumber, green chilli and coriander greens have gone up after the flood and landslide.The vegetable price was already high, and an additional jump amid the nearing festivals has worried consumers.According to a central bank report released last Thursday, the food and beverage inflation stood at 6.17 percent in mid-August compared to the same period last year.Under the food and beverage category, the year-on-year price index of the vegetable sub-category increased 19.07 percent, pulses and legumes 12.09 percent, cereal grains and their products 9.15 percent, and milk products and eggs 3.66 percent.A few wholesalers the Post talked to said that flood impacts on the warehouses have been big, which could increase the prices.Pabitra Bajracharya, president of Nepal Retailers Association, however, said that the retailers have been less affected.“As there is sufficient stock of food items like rice, edible oil, pulses and legumes, I do not think the prices of essential consumable goods will go up,” he said. “However, the opportunist wholesalers may hike the price on the pretext of floods and landslides.”Retailers said that the wholesalers have already hiked the price of edible oil.“I have been selling sunflower oil at Rs210 per litre. Today (Sunday), the distributor quoted Rs222 per litre wholesale. I have to sell the edible oil at Rs240 per litre to consumers,” said Bajracharya. That’s a hike of 15 percent overnight. “Even I am shocked at the new rate,” said Bajracharya.Retailers said there is no reason for the price of rice, pulses, and legumes to rise immediately as the traders have sufficient stock. However, as most of the traders' warehouses in the Kuleshower and Balkhu area were flooded on Saturday, damaging their goods, these traders may recover the losses by passing the burden on to consumers, Bajracharya said.Subodh Kumar Gupta, immediate past president of the Association of Nepalese Rice, Oil and Pulses Industries, said, “We have stocks of rice, edible oil, pulses and legumes for three months in different factories and warehouses outside the Kathmandu valley. In Kathmandu, the stocks may last a month. But the transportation problem is prolonged, and there could be a shortage of food items in Kathmandu Valley.”Consumer rights activists said traders may create artificial shortages to jack up prices in difficult times when the government’s monitoring of the market is poor.“The government’s supply utilities like the Food Management and Trading Company and the Salt Trading [Corporation Limited] have no sufficient stock of food. The government's preparedness to check the market price during a disaster like this has not been up to the mark,” said Madhav Timalsina, president of the Consumer Rights Investigation Forum.He said it is unjustifiable to raise the prices of food, vegetables, and fruits exorbitantly because of the partial flood in the Kuleshwar area and vegetable market.“If traders are seen hiking the prices, they need to be booked immediately.”Even in the past, such as during the border blockade and the Covid-19 period, the government mechanism utterly failed to control the prices. \nUS President Joe Biden will announce on Tuesday the donation of 1 million mpox vaccine doses and at least $500 million to African countries to support their response to the outbreak, according to a senior administration official.Biden will make the announcement in New York, where he is attending the United Nations General Assembly, and call on other countries to follow suit, the person told Reuters.In August, the World Health Organization declared mpox a global public health emergency for the second time in two years, following an outbreak of the viral infection in the Democratic Republic of Congo that has spread to neighbouring countries and beyond, including India, raising alarm.“It wouldn’t be a huge surprise if there were a case in the United States, either,” the official said, noting that recent cuts in pandemic support by Congress may hamper a domestic response.“We’re really squeezing right now to be able to respond effectively in this moment. And I think anticipating potentially additional cuts in the future will make it more and more difficult for us to have a robust response to these types of outbreaks.”Mpox can spread through close contact. Usually mild, it is fatal in rare cases. It causes flu-like symptoms and pus-filled lesions on the body.The outbreak in Congo began with the spread of an endemic strain, known as clade I. But a new variant, clade Ib, appears to spread more easily through routine close contact, including sexual contact.The expectation is that the US donated doses will be of the Bavarian Nordic vaccine known as Jynneos in the United States, and many will come from a stockpile in the United States. The 1 million doses is in addition to the 60,000 previously donated shots.The US official said the administration expects Gavi, a public-private alliance which co-funds vaccine purchases for low-income countries, to distribute the donated vaccines.“We feel really strongly that Gavi is the multilateral institution that is best positioned to procure and equitably distribute vaccines,” the official said.Last week, Gavi said it will buy 500,000 doses of Bavarian Nordic's vaccine, its first purchase to help battle the outbreak.The Biden administration is also pushing for more vaccines to be manufactured in low and middle-income countries, and is working with Brazil to identify how the Group of 20 club of nations can support the mpox response.There is not currently a manufacturer in Africa that is able to make the complex drug substance needed to make the vaccine, the US official said. \nAt least 190 women from 51 districts died of complications during childbirth in the fiscal year 2023-024, data provided by the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services show. The actual number of maternal deaths due to birth-related complications could be much higher, as maternal and perinatal death surveillance is being carried out in 51 districts only, officials say.“Maternal deaths from childbirth-related complications could be significantly underreported, as we are only tracking cases in 51 districts,” said Nisha Joshi, a public health official at the division. “We have no data on maternal and perinatal deaths in the rest of the districts.”In the fiscal year 2022-023, 191 maternal deaths were recorded across 49 districts. Nepal reduced the maternal mortality rate from 239 per 100,000 births in 2016 to 151 per 100,000 in 2021, according to the national census carried out by the National Statistics Office. Earlier, the country had reduced the maternal mortality rate from 539 per 100,000 births in 1996 to 239 per 100,000 births in 2016—for which the country even received a Millennium Development Goals award. The health target under the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals is to reduce the maternal mortality rate to 75 per 100,000 births by 2030.The latest census report has shown that 622 maternal deaths were recorded in a year. Officials at the Health Ministry concede that the number of deaths reported from 51 districts is only around 30 percent of the total maternal deaths occurring across the country.They complained that the lack of maternal and perinatal death surveillance programmes in all districts is the main reason for the underreporting of maternal deaths. “Due to budget constraints, we could not expand the maternal and perinatal death surveillance to other districts this year,” said Joshi. “We also have problems in the reporting system, and deaths that occur in villages of the districts without surveillance programmes go unreported.”Maternal health experts say that concerned authorities are keeping themselves in the dark by not conducting studies in all districts. “Without knowing the actual situation, effective planning is not possible, which means efforts to reduce ongoing deaths may not succeed,” said Dr Ganesh Dangal, a maternal health expert. A huge budget is not necessary to carry out death surveillance. So this programme should be enforced mandatorily in all districts immediately.”Maternal and perinatal death surveillance is a key intervention for improving maternal, perinatal, and neonatal survival rates. Experts say such surveillance provides an understanding of the number and causes of deaths, enabling more targeted and effective interventions.Nepal strives to reduce the deaths of mothers and babies. However, it lacks maternal and perinatal death surveillance in all districts.Perinatal death is the death of a baby between 22 weeks of gestation (or weighing 500g) and seven days after birth.The World Health Organisation said that maternal and perinatal death surveillance and response (MPDSR) is an essential quality improvement intervention, which permits the identification, notification, quantification and determination of causes and avoidability of maternal and neonatal deaths and stillbirth to orient the measures necessary for their prevention.According to the UN health body, systematic analyses of overall mortality trends and events and contributing factors leading to individual deaths can identify barriers in health systems and inspire local solutions to prevent such deaths in the future.Studies carried out in the past show that excessive bleeding after childbirth, pre-eclampsia and eclampsia (pregnancy-related high blood pressure disorders) are some of the reasons for maternal deaths.The World Health Organisation said postpartum haemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal mortality in low-income countries and the primary cause of nearly a quarter of all maternal deaths globally. Most deaths resulting from the said complication occur during the first 24 hours after birth.Gynaecologists say tears in the cervix or tissues of the vagina, tear in a blood vessel in the uterus, bleeding in hidden tissue area or space in the pelvis, blood clotting disorders, and placenta problems are among the causes of postpartum haemorrhage.Every year, over 600,000 women deliver babies in Nepal. \nAs many as 17 people, including children, have died, and 63 others have been infected with the Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus since the start of the monsoon in June this year.Twenty-nine districts, including those in the Kathmandu Valley, have reported infection from the deadly virus, while 12 districts—Kailali, Kapilvastu, Palpa, Chitwan, Parsa, Rautahat, Sarlahi, Siraha, Dhanusha, Sindhuli, Jhapa and Sunsari—have reported deaths from the infection.“We have alerted agencies concerned to conduct awareness drives and implement other prevention measures in the districts where Japanese encephalitis infections or deaths have been reported,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division. “We have also requested various aid agencies, including the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation, to supply JE vaccine.”Japanese encephalitis is a viral brain infection caused by the JE virus, which is endemic in Asia and parts of the Western Pacific. According to the World Health Organization, it is a mosquito-borne flavivirus, belonging to the same family as dengue, Zika, yellow fever, and West Nile viruses. The virus kills a third of those who fall ill and leaves up to half of those who survive with severe life-long disabilities, according to the UN health body.Officials say that September and October are the peak months for JE outbreaks.Health officials say this year’s death rate from the JE virus has exceeded 27 percent, and among the deceased, the number of children under 15 years of age is very high. Nepal has included the vaccine in its routine immunisation list, which the government provides free of cost to all children.The country started administering the vaccine doses in 2006, eight years before the World Health Organization officially issued prequalification certification, due to the high infection and deaths from the virus at the time. In 2005, JE killed nearly 2,000 people in Nepal—mostly children from the districts of Tarai region. In the first phase, all populations of the highly-affected four districts, Banke, Bardia, Dang, and Kailali, were inoculated with the JE vaccine. Later, the vaccination programme was expanded to 19 other affected districts, and children under 15 were inoculated.The government integrated the JE vaccine into the routine immunisation list in 2015. Even though the vaccine is included in the regular immunisation list, several people still die, and dozens get infected by the deadly virus every year.Data from the Health Ministry show that less than 50 percent of the infected patients were found inoculated with the vaccine.Doctors say the disease has no cure, so treatment focuses on managing symptoms. However, safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent infection. Health officials said they are aware of the deadly disease outbreak and have already started consulting aid agencies for help to finance the JE vaccination programme.However, officials at the Department of Health Services said that none of the donors have taken health officials' requests seriously or shown interest in supporting the immunisation drive.Public health experts say that this is the right time to vaccinate all those at risk. Even if the vaccine does not help in outbreak management, it provides immunity from future infections. The JE virus is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected Culex mosquitoes. Pigs and ducks are considered natural reservoirs of the virus.Doctors advise taking precautions to avoid mosquito bites, such as using mosquito repellents, wearing long-sleeved clothes, and getting vaccinated if one lives in or is travelling to disease-endemic areas. They also stress the importance of awareness and timely treatment to prevent infections and deaths.An estimated 12.5 million people are thought to be at high risk of JE infection in Nepal. \nDusit Princess Kathmandu is organising a five-day trout festival at its SOI restaurant. The dishes will be available for order from 12:30 pm to 10:00 pm every day till August 30. In celebration of Nepal’s rivers and lakes, which provide an ideal environment for high-quality trout, the Director of Culinary Food and Beverage Service, Chef Utpal Mondal, and his team at Dusit Princess Kathmandu have crafted a menu showcasing the flavours and versatility of locally sourced trout. “As the festive month of Shrawan ends, people focus on healthy and nutritious food. Trout, rich in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and essential minerals, offers a heart-friendly option that checks all the boxes from a nutritional and culinary standpoint,” says Mondal.He adds that the goal of the culinary event is to offer their guests a rare opportunity to experience a wide variety of trout dishes they wouldn’t typically find at home.The event menu features twelve unique dishes, six of which are drawn from diverse culinary traditions across continents. Three dishes are inspired by oriental cuisine, while the remaining three highlight flavours from Nepal and India. The menu has been designed to include various dishes, from soups and starters to main courses, including Mexican, Italian, Continental, and Thai flavours.While discussing the event’s highlights, Mondal said, “The celebration presents a unique opportunity for guests to indulge in a diverse range of trout-based dishes, something they wouldn’t typically have the chance to experience elsewhere.” \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder.

Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nNepal were finally able to register victory in Canada when they defeated Oman by 37 runs in their second match of the Canada T20I series in King City on Sunday.Nepal were winless in Canada, losing their three ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup League 2 matches before their last game of the series against Oman was washed out by rain. The Rhinos also lost the opening game of the T20I series against Canada by 14 runs.The victory finally ended Nepal's winless run of eight straight matches that stretched back to the T20 World Cup warm up against Canada in Dallas.However, their League 2 flop in King City will hurt more as they have managed to win only one in their eight matches. The Canada no show also extended their losing streak in the League 2 to five straight games. Nepal sit in the seventh position in the eight-team League 2 with just three points.Rohit Paudel’s team will now look to continue the momentum when they face the same sides (Canada and Oman) in the second round of the T20I series before heading to the United States to participate in the League 2 United States Tri-series that also involves Scotland.Gulsan Jha has been outstanding in Canada and finally succeeded to guide the Rhinos to victory after his half-century and a fifer could not stop Nepal from suffering a loss against Oman in the 50-over format League 2.On Sunday, Jha played an aggressive knock of 40 not out off 17 balls smashing three fours and three sixes helping his side post a decent total of 176-6 from their 20 overs.Anil Sah and Aasif Sheikh were also able to find their form finally after a poor show with the bat in their previous three outings in Canada. Sheikh’s top score was 11 in his three previous games, while Sah could not even touch the double digit figures.Sah scored 27 off 21 and Sheikh made 27 off 22 to give Nepal a good start.Dev Khanal played his second T20I after making debut against Canada on Saturday and failed to impress as he was dismissed for two runs.Captain Paudel also struggled to find consistency with the bat, falling cheaply for two.Kushal Malla returned to the squad after being dropped in the League 2 tri-series and contributed a significant 30 off 26.Bhurtel was also back in the playing XI but was demoted to number six after failing to make his mark in the opening order. He finally did some good work scoring 20 runs (17 balls) and supported Jha’s explosive innings.Dipendra Singh Airee also came out of the dug out after being benched in the League 2 and played a quick-fire 18 off just five balls.In reply, Karan KC took 3-36, Bhurtel picked 2-32 including the dangerman Shoaib Khan, and Jha returned the match figures of 2-14 to wrap up Oman for 139.Shoaib top-scored for Oman with 45 runs off 39 balls.Rafiullah made 33 runs facing 12 deliveries. \nThe 2025 FIFA Club World Cup final will be held at the New Jersey home of the NFL’s New York Giants and New York Jets, world soccer’s governing body announced on Saturday along with the venue lineup for the revamped tournament.The expanded 32-team tournament, which will feature leading clubs from around the world, will be held in 12 stadiums around the United States next year from June 15-July 13.The open-air stadium for the final, which opened in 2010 and has a capacity of 82,500, held the Copa America Centenario final in 2016 when Chile denied Lionel Messi’s Argentina for a second time in a penalty shootout.The venue was also announced earlier this year as the site of the 2026 World Cup final.The other venues, mostly a mix of NFL and Major League Soccer stadiums, are in Atlanta, Charlotte, Cincinnati, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville, Philadelphia, Seattle, Washington and two in Orlando.The Club World Cup will have eight groups of four with the top two teams from each group advancing to the single-match knockout stage from the round of 16 to the final.FIFPRO’s European member unions have started legal action against FIFA over the Club World Cup due to concerns over the impact of a crammed calendar on players’ health and performance. \nAll Nepal Football Association (ANFA) on Saturday postponed the ANFA Women’s League football match between Nepal Police Club and Sankata until further notice.“The match between Nepal Police Club and Sankata Club has been postponed until further notice due to adverse weather conditions,” ANFA said in a statement.Police, who have already qualified for the Super League, and the already-eliminated Sankata were scheduled to clash in the final game of the first round on Saturday.Police have already secured third position in the ten-team standing with a game in hand. They have 18 points.The top five teams progressed to the Super League, which will be played in a double round robin format.Defending champions Armed Police Force Club topped the table with 25 points, while Tribhuvan Army Club secured second position in the league with 22 points.Waling Municipality (15 points) and Koshi Province (14 points) are the other teams who advanced into the second round.Bagmati Youth Club, Chandrapur Municipality, Karnali Province and Sudurpaschim Province were also eliminated from the first round.ANFA is yet to announce the schedule for the Super League stage. \nRashmi Kumari Ghising scored five goals, including two penalties, as defending champions Armed Police Force Club destroyed Bagmati Youth Club 7-0 at the ANFA Complex in Lalitpur on Friday—ensuring that they advance into the Super League as table toppers.Anita Basnet and Sabita Rana Magar were also on target for APF, who extended their winning streak to eight matches after playing a 0-0 draw against Nepal Police Club in their opening match.APF, who have 25 points from nine matches, remain clear favourites to win the title as they look to win a fourth title in a row. They have now scored a total of 53 goals against the two conceded.Ghising has scored more than four goals in three straight games now. She also scored five against Koshi in APF’s 8-0 victory and four in APF’s 19-0 mauling of Sudurpaschim.Ghising also leads the goal-scoring tally with 17 goals—nine more than Waling Municipality’s Jackline Nassali who is second in the list.Ghising was unstoppable on a rainy afternoon against already eliminated Bagmati at Satdobato again, scoring twice in the space of five minutes towards the end of the first half that put APF in complete control of the game.Her first came in the 35th minute. Anita KC was the provider as she raced into the penalty box to find a through pass from Anita Basnet, used her intelligence to trick advancing Bagmati goalkeeper Sujata Tamang and laid it for Ghising to slam into the empty net.Ghising doubled APF’s lead in the 40th minute when her powerful header off a cross from Basnet deflected off Bagmati’s Sunita Bhulan before finding the bottom corner.Basnet then combined with Ghising again to further APF’s lead two minutes after the restart after good works from Preeti Rai and KC.Ghising completed her hat-trick in the 58th minute through a penalty that was awarded to APF after Bagmati captain Divya Yasmali Magar handled the ball inside the box.More misery was piled on Bagmati after their first choice goalie Tamang had to be stretchered off after suffering an injury.Ghising added more salt to Bagmati wounds, converting another penalty past substitute goalkeeper Karun Budhathoki in the 82nd minute after Bhulan handled the ball.Ghising then netted her fifth in the 88th minute poking home a powerful shot from close range after Saru Limbu set her up.Rana Magar rounded off a comprehensive victory for APF, tapping a cross from Rai. Army hit five past KarnaliTribhuvan Army Club finished the first round in the second position on 22 points with a 5-0 thrashing of Karnali Province later in the afternoon.Army, who are looking to win their maiden title, are the other high-scoring team in the league and showed their firepower going up 3-0 after 12 minutes, with Chandra Bhandari, Bimala Chaudhary and Amisha Karki finding the net.Dipa Shahi and Dipa Rai added Army’s fourth and fifth in the second half to complete a comfortable win.Army have scored a total of 51 goals from their nine games. They have conceded four.Nepal Police Club, who have also qualified for the second round, take on Sankata in the last fixture of the first round on Saturday.Waling Municipality and Koshi Province are the other teams to have progressed into the Super League, which will be played in a double round robin format.The top four teams in the Super League will play Qualifiers, Eliminator and Final. \nWaling Municipality and Koshi Province progressed to the Super League stage of the ANFA Women’s League on Thursday.Waling defeated Chandrapur Municipality 2-1 while Koshi thumped Sudurpaschim Province 4-0 at the ANFA Complex in Lalitpur that secured both a top-five finish after the first round.Defending champions Armed Police Force Club lead the standings with 22 points. Tribhuvan Army Club are second and Nepal Police Club occupy the third spot.The victories ensured Waling a fourth-placed finish and Koshi fifth position in the ten-team standings.Sudurpaschim, who were already eliminated before the Koshi clash, concluded their struggling season without a victory and at the bottom of the table.Chandrapur crashed out after loss to Waling, while the outcomes also eliminated unfortunate Bagmati Youth Club and Sankata from the race for top-five finish without playing their final league matches.Both Waling and Koshi needed a victory to book their tickets to the remaining two spots in the second round.Waling were the first to do so, courtesy of goals from Sukriya Miya and Jackline Nassali.Miya gave Waling the lead in the fifth minute with a beautiful volley after Chandrapur goalkeeper Usha Thapa’s failed attempt to grab a corner landed directly into the path of Maya.Uganda forward Nassali doubled Waling’s lead in the 37th minute, beautifully finishing off a counter attack after she was set up by Sushma Tamang.Sunita Sunar gave Chandrapur hopes of comeback, pulling their first goal of the game in the 50th minute with a cool finish.But Waling held on to the slim lead to qualify for the next round.Koshi had a relatively easier task against Sudurpaschim and romped to victory comfortably after Samikshya Magar hit a brace. Mamata Raut and Khusma Rai were also on target for Koshi.Magar was also involved in Koshi’s opening goal as she set up Raut whose lofted shot stung the palm of Sudurpaschim goalkeeper Tikesori Saud before finding the net in the 24th minute.Magar furthered Koshi’s lead in the 53rd minute. Raut was the provider. She intercepted a poor goal kick from Amita Bhul and quickly fed Sunita Sarkar on the right. Sarkar then launched a perfect cross for Magar to tap home.Magar then added Koshi’s third in the 65th minute thanks to Purnima Rai’s skilled footwork. Rai showed her control to receive a through pass from Neha Kumari Chaudhary inside the box and artfully put the ball through advancing goalie Saud and two other defenders. Magar was waiting in front of the empty net and tucked away a simple finish.Khusma wrapped up the victory in the 85th minute with a powerful long ranger.The Super League will be played in a double robin format. The top four finishers will compete in the Qualifiers, Eliminator and final. \nJapan’s incoming prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba, said on Monday he will call a general election for Oct. 27 following his victory in one of the closest ever leadership races for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party.The poll, which will come a year early and ahead of the US presidential election in November, will decide which party controls parliament’s lower house. Lawmakers there will meet tomorrow to confirm him as the country’s next prime minister.“It is important for the new administration to be judged by the people as soon as possible,” Ishiba said at a press conference at LDP headquarters in Tokyo.Japanese shares fell more than 4% in early trading on Monday as the yen strengthened and Japanese government bonds jumped in reaction to the leadership win by Ishiba, who is seen as a monetary policy hawk.Ishiba on Monday began picking government and party officials who will contest the upcoming general election with him.So far those include two rival candidates in the leadership race, Katsunobu Kato as finance minister and Yoshimasa Hayashi to stay on as chief cabinet secretary, a pivotal post that includes the role of top government spokesman, two sources familiar with the appointments earlier told Reuters.A close Ishiba ally, Takeshi Iwaya, a former defence chief, will take over as foreign minister, while Gen Nakatani will return to the defence ministry, a position he held in 2016, said the sources, who asked not to be identified because they are not authorized to speak to the media, confirming earlier media reports.Yoji Muto, a former junior minister, will take charge at the economy, trade and industry ministry, a separate source said.Not included in his picks, however, is Sanae Takaichi, the hardline conservative he beat by 215 votes to 194 on Friday in the closest leadership election in almost seven decades.Takaichi’s absence could make it difficult for Ishiba to manage a fractious ruling group roiled by scandals that have sapped its public support.Media reports that Takaichi has declined a post “could point to a weakness in Ishiba’s support base, which could cause him problems going forward,” said Hiroshi Shiratori, a political science professor at Hosei University in Tokyo.Ishiba picked another rival, Shinjiro Koizumi, as his election campaign chief, along with former Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, a Koizumi backer, who is the party’s new vice president. Both joined him at his press conference on Monday.Ishiba, 67, won the LDP leadership race on his fifth attempt with strong backing from rank-and-file members.He is however, considered something of troublemaker by many of his parliamentary colleagues for often defying party policy. On Friday before his run off election against Takaichi he apologised to LDP lawmakers for his “shortcomings”. \nA Palestinian militant group said on Monday that three of its leaders were killed in an Israeli strike on Beirut, the first attack within city limits as Israel escalated hostilities against Iran’s allies in the region.The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) said the three leaders were killed in a strike that targeted Beirut’s Kola district.The strike hit the upper floor of an apartment building in the Kola district of Lebanon’s capital, Reuters witnesses said.There was no immediate comment from Israel’s military.Israel’s increasing frequency of attacks against the Hezbollah militia in Lebanon and the Houthi militia in Yemen have prompted fears that Middle East fighting could spin out of control and draw in Iran and the United States, Israel’s main ally.The PFLP is another militant group taking part in the fight against Israel.Israel on Sunday launched airstrikes against the Houthi militia in Yemen and dozens of Hezbollah targets throughout Lebanon after earlier killing the Hezbollah leader.The Houthi-run health ministry said at least four people were killed and 29 wounded in airstrikes on Yemen’s port of Hodeidah, which Israel said were a response to Houthi missile attacks. In Lebanon, authorities said at least 105 people had been killed by Israeli air strikes on Sunday.Lebanon’s Health Ministry has said more than 1,000 Lebanese have been killed and 6,000 wounded in the past two weeks, without saying how many were civilians. The government said a million people - a fifth of the population - have fled their homes.The intensifying Israeli bombardment over two weeks has killed a string of top Hezbollah officials, including its leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah.Israel has vowed to keep up the assault and says it wants to make its northern areas secure again for residents who have been forced to flee Hezbollah rocket attacks.Israeli drones hovered over Beirut for much of Sunday, with the loud blasts of new airstrikes echoing around the Lebanese capital. Displaced families spent the night on benches at Zaitunay Bay, a string of restaurants and cafes on Beirut’s waterfront.Many of Israel’s attacks have been carried out in the south of Lebanon, where the Iran-backed Hezbollah has most of its operations, or Beirut’s southern suburbs.Monday’s attack in the Kola district appeared to be the first strike within Beirut’s city limits. Syrians living in southern Lebanon who had fled Israeli bombardment had been sleeping under a bridge in the neighborhood for days, residents of the area said.The United States has urged a diplomatic resolution to the conflict in Lebanon but has also authorised its military to reinforce in the region.U.S. President Joe Biden, asked if an all-out war in the Middle East could be avoided, said “It has to be.” He said he will be talking to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. \nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nWhat animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. \nNepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) \nFrom Nebraska to New York, the Americans serve a sorry version of tea labelled chai latte—basically spiced up milk and water with a hint of tea. They really don’t do chiya well. Perhaps because they grow so little of it, with only 40 hectares spared for it in the whole of mainland US. Contrast this puny acreage for tea with humongous areas set aside for corn and soybean.The US is the largest corn producer in the world, churning out nearly 400 million metric tons last year. It is also a soybean heavyweight, growing some 114 million tons of the stuff a year. The success of these two products is a testament to the American ingenuity in agricultural innovation and mechanisation. On a recent hot August day, I was on the soybean farm of Kyle Durham in the US state of Missouri. A sixth generation farmer, Durham lives on the farm with his wife Courney and their two sons. Founded by Durham’s grandfather after the Second World War, his farm, which at this time of year was covered in green Soybean plants, stretches over 1,000 hectares.I am curious. “How many people do you employ in the planting and harvesting of soybeans?” I ask the middle-aged soy farmer with a salt and pepper goatee. “I do it all myself,” he says. I can hardly believe my ears. Back in Nepal, I start thinking, it would take at least 20 farm hands to work a field of a similar size. Durham then takes us to his sizable shed to show some of his farm equipment. The soy harvester is as big as a mini-house, capable, we are told, of planting the whole farm in around 10-15 days.“How much does this thing cost?” I ask.“Around 600,000 dollars,” he replies. The planter is of a similar size. Everything here is on an industrial scale.The US is better known as a technological goliath, birthing such world-beating tech giants as Apple and Google. Lesser known are its agriculture exploits. Yet even in agriculture, it is a model of efficiency and endless experimentation.According to the US Department of Agriculture, the total farm output in the country tripled between 1948 and 2021, even as total input use declined. The American farmers and their representative bodies work closely with local research universities to boost yield and discover more weather and pest resistant crop varieties. Even at the risk of comparing chalk and cheese, it is worth nothing that Nepal’s productivity is dismal—even by regional standards. According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, between 1960 and 2017, the annual growth rate of rice yield in Nepal was 1.14 percent—substantially less than the corresponding figures for India (2.5 percent), Bangladesh (three percent) and China (4.2 percent). In this time, the global average was 4.5 percent.No wonder Nepal is these days importing even the cereals that it once exported in abundance. Nepal used to export more food than it imported until the early 1980s. But it became a net importer from the early 1980s, and such imports really took wings after 2008.The country is still an agriculture-based economy, the sector engaging over 60 percent of its people. Yet it is also clearly not a government priority. Forget fancy equipment. Our farmers don’t even get timely fertilisers, as a result of which they are having to cut down on paddy acreage. Nepal’s agricultural woes will only get worse with climate change. Indications are that changes in precipitation patterns will affect rainfed agriculture, resulting in annual yield variability and higher production risks.Yet our government continues in its own merry, do-little way, which is why, even as the risks multiply, the implementation of vital agriculture policies remains dismal. Take the National Agricultural Policy 2004, which came to support the Agricultural Perspective Plan, a cross-sectional strategy to make Nepal self-sufficient in food. The policy was brought to boost agriculture-led rural development. To take just one example of its poor implementation, the policy discourages transformation of fertile land for non-agricultural uses, and adoption of more scientific land use. Yet after all these years the conversion of agricultural into non-agricultural land continues unabated. Our politicians and lawmakers didn’t see any political benefit in the policy’s implementation, it seems. Even the champions of the proletariat in Nepal have turned into uber-bourgeois, and there is now no political party that understands farmers. This is self-defeating. As things stand, productive agriculture is Nepal’s best shot at prosperity. But without state support, little will come out of it. The US heavily subsidises its crops and dairy products, partly as a result of the outsized political clout of American farmers. Even in India, there are large subsidies for fertilisers, as well as generous irrigation and crop insurance—not to mention a legion of hidden subsidies. By comparison, in Nepal, things like minimum support prices and input subsidies are as good as non-existent. When other countries, big and small, are offering substantial subsidies to their farmers, why have we failed to protect and promote our own farmers? Why is there such a mismatch between our status as an agricultural country and the reality on the ground? This is no trivial issue. Food insecurity is emerging as a big global challenge. Even Nepal is often affected by India’s sudden bans on export of daily commodities like sugar and grains. Earlier this year, rice prices surged in Nepal after India banned the export of non-basmati white rice. Nepalis, as a result, are having to set aside larger and larger sums from their fixed incomes just to feed themselves. Pretty much the same thing happens with many of the fruits and vegetables. There is no reason Nepali agriculture should be struggling so badly despite the country’s obvious challenges: Besides the ones mentioned above, land fragmentation, difficult terrains, high exodus of youths, and the absence of the economies of scale available to the likes of the US and India. Back home in Nepal, as I finally get to sip on some locally-grown, delectably light white tea, I cannot help but think: In a country where under 2 percent of its people are into agriculture, the American farmers are rich and wield enormous political power. In sharp contrast, in Nepal, where a solid majority of people still rely directly or indirectly on agriculture for their livelihood, the Nepali farmers are poor, and they now have next to no political power that they can use to change their lot.   \nNepali politics has begun to take more emotional swings than the ideological and political projections that guided earlier discussions and actions. Judging from the performance of some of the major characters, if not all, we can see the following.The overplayed bravado seems to be the character of some political leaders of the major parties. Though the leaders sound emotional and superbly ideological in their party-related speeches, they are torn between dreams and realities as never before. The sense of futurity and the dream plans for the country of some intelligent political leaders are mired in their narratives of conduct and misguided ambitions. Their intellectual and policy documents are few and far between. Evoking fear, emotion and threat appears to be the common style. However, it would be wrong to conclude that the entire political system and the modus operandi of all the political leaders possess this character.I would like to mention some occasions to enter the subject, which is the changing character of Nepali politics on some important scores. Political scientists and historians have been writing on this. History says Nepali political parties came into existence by choosing certain political ideologies as the guiding principles. The broad division line was between the social democratic principles and communist ideology. The political parties did lay down their programmes and principles regarding the economy’s management, the structure of political organisations, and the nature of the constitution. I remember raising slogans as a school student supporting a political party and repeating its complex economic and political programmes. People from different walks of life repeated the slogans like a mantra. The parties drew from the ideologies propounded by scholars, philosophers and leaders like Karl Marx, Mahatma Gandhi, Mao Zedong and others. We grew with the ideological foregrounding dominating the organisations of the political parties. But later, such ideological foregrounding lost its earlier attraction. The party leaders travel to different parts of the country for what they call consciousness-raising. However, the basic mode of party propaganda and schooling is dominated by oral discourses, rhetorics and interactions, not the teaching of hard-core ideologies. I understand political parties do not prioritise elaborating or explaining the ideological part, since it has lost its original attraction. What we have now is a post-ideological situation, created by the Nepali political parties, especially the communists. This becomes important, if we consider the major transformations and experiments that Nepal’s communists have made in their ideological options.Maoist leader Lokendra Bista Magar ‘Abhyas’ met me at my working table at Himalayan Java Coffee House in Thamel over a decade ago. A huge tome running 800 pages titled Nepali Communist Andolan ra Janakrantika Aitihasik Dastabejharu (2070 BS) or \"The historical documents of the Nepali Communist Movements and People's Revolution\" accompanied him. He wanted me to review the book. I tried to convince him that I was not the right person. However, Bista said, \"We want a non-partisan literary person to review this.\" His remarks struck me, and I decided to write and publish the book review in Kantipur (May 19, 2014). The book begins with the first pamphlet published after the establishment of the Nepal Communist Party on September 15, 1945, and includes documents about the breaking and coming together of different communist groups. Overall, the tome is a vast single self-review of the Nepali communists. The swings in the communist parties are noteworthy. Take the Maoist movement, the party's armed insurgency and the grand peace agreement they signed with the other seven parliamentary parties on November 21, 2006, as examples. The latest big party, organised around the so-called ideology and the name of Mao, did not put a premium on the tremendous production of ideological propaganda. However, as the bibliographies show, there is a massive body of work written about the Maoist movement, and the Maoists separately and systematically elaborated the party's ideology as a project. This is an interesting subject of study. The Maoist armed movement naturally had an impact on Nepali politics. They shunned the path after the agreement. It is significant how the political leaders, especially the communists who have carved out the history of Nepal, find the Bangladesh uprising an eloquent example to evoke fear of disruption and uprising in the country. As a senior responsible leader, this is a natural warning from Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the erstwhile prime minister. However, his other remarks do not give credence to that. Similarly, the CPN-UML, instead of uniting parties on addressing the country’s important issues, has chosen to stoke the fire by rubbing the word himsa or violence that they see as the sole character of the Maoists. But this is a mere semantic luxury to rub on the word himsa and enjoy seeing the Maoist leaders shout in opposition, promising to stall the parliamentary proceedings. Nepali Congress lives on with BP Koirala and his ideals. Koirala did not write great theoretical works; instead, he chose to write great literary works. He saw immense power in the inner dynamics of his characters' psyche; he decided to keep that separate from his politics. Koirala had a clear conscience about political matters. He made a famous declaration that he was an anarchist in literature and a socialist in politics. Other parties come with similar packages of dreams, ideologies, and disillusionments.I was asked to comment on the book launch of Prachanda: The Unknown Revolutionary (2008), written about Dahal by Anirban Roy, a Hindustan Times journalist and published by Mandala Book Point. The event was held at the Himalaya Hotel. The people invited to the dais were the then Chairman of the Constituent Assembly, Subas Chandra Nembang, Dahal’s father, Muktinath Dahal, and me. That was Dahal’s first stint as prime minister, yet he could not attend the programme. Dahal’s father signed a book for me and said, among other things, “Honesty is the greatest strength of a political leader.” Whenever I see the wavy signature of this simple and inspiring farmer, I feel that political leaders are slowly abandoning the path of honesty. \nThis article is based on the conversations I have had with students, alums, employers, HR trainers, consultants and educators about the current job market landscape and the increasingly common trend of job hopping. As an educator who has led the placement cell of a business school for seven consecutive years, I have noticed shifts in the Nepali job market dynamics. Job-hopping behaviour of younger employees, especially Generation Z, born between 1997 and 2012, and millennials, born between 1981 and 1996, is a particular concern for employers. A Gallup study found that Millennials are most likely to switch jobs, with 6 millennials out of 10 open to new opportunities, reflecting their low engagement in the workforce. This is also evident in Nepal, especially in sectors like IT, startups, banking, corporate and development. In today's gig economy, career paths for younger generations significantly differ from those of earlier generations. However, due to the lack of official data and empirical research on job hopping in the country, this piece takes an exploratory approach to understanding the phenomenon.Why do people job-hop?There are various reasons why people change jobs, such as insufficient compensation, lack of career opportunities, limited growth potential, low job satisfaction and dissatisfaction with workplace culture and toxic environment. Common complaints include issues with supervisors' communication styles, lack of mentorship and development, boredom, uninspiring work environment, misalignment with company values, rigid dress codes and ineffective communication channels like social media. Younger generations prefer their supervisors and seniors to use communication channels and platforms that align with their preferences, such as voice messages and images, to convey messages instead of lengthy written content. The younger generation values appealing modern job titles like \"lead\" and avoids workplace cultures that use traditional hierarchical titles such as \"officer\" or \"assistant,\" even for entry-level positions.These generations believe that job-hopping can accelerate career growth. They prioritise work-life balance, favouring flexible hours and remote work opportunities over higher pay. Non-financial benefits, such as two-day weekends and a relaxed office culture, are also attractive to them. Platforms like LinkedIn allow them to share career expectations, which enhances their negotiating power easily. Additionally, headhunting is prevalent, and being approached by recruiters often encourages employees to switch jobs, as it makes them feel valued and offers opportunities for better compensation or promotions. In startups and smaller firms, job security and career stagnation further drive job hopping. Nepali youths may also switch jobs to fit in with social circles, as it is sometimes seen as a trend. Long-term jobs are less appealing to these gig workers, who prefer project-based assignments and dislike hierarchical structures. They seek recognition and value performance metrics over traditional benefits like pensions. As a result, their commitment to long-term employment is often limited. In Nepal, alongside the rise of employees switching jobs domestically, experienced workers in specific sectors prefer to move abroad for better opportunities. Consequences of job hoppingFrom my frequent interactions with younger professionals, it is clear that competitive salaries are a major factor driving job switches, often without considering long-term impact. This can hinder deep skill development, as constantly seeking diverse experiences may result in inconsistent expertise.Employers often perceive frequent job changes as signs of instability, which can harm an employee's reputation. While job hopping can lead to diverse skills, it may not always result in meaningful growth, and those switching for higher positions might experience only superficial progress. Job hopping is resulting in rising employee turnover, which is affecting productivity, increasing recruitment costs and leading to the loss of institutional knowledge.Is job hopping really bad?Many Nepali employers are making concerted efforts to retain top talent by engaging employees through innovative programmes like employee development initiatives. The Employee First, Customer Second (EFCS) approach prioritises employee well-being over customer satisfaction, believing that their happiness can result in better customer service. Organisations offer study opportunities and programmes like in-house Toastmasters, which are fully funded for employees.Although job hopping may seem negative, it does not necessarily harm the economy. Recent research shows that the relationship between how long someone has worked (tenure) and their productivity forms a curve. Analysis of the workforce's tenure suggested that the positive impact of tenure on productivity becomes smaller over time. Hence, longer tenure does not always result in performance enhancement.The concept of Pareto optimality, or Pareto efficiency, is relevant in the labour market, particularly regarding job hopping, where both employees and employers can benefit. When a situation is Pareto optimal, one party cannot improve their situation without negatively impacting someone else. This principle applies to the relationship between employers and employees, especially when job changes benefit both. For employees, job changes often lead to better opportunities, such as improved pay, work-life balance, career growth, or job satisfaction. An employee may find a new position that aligns closely with their values, skills, or career goals, enhancing their situation without harming their previous employer.Employers also gain from job hopping. When an employee leaves, it allows the employer to seek candidates who may be a better fit for the role. For example, if a former employee is disengaged, their departure can lead to hiring someone more aligned with the company's objectives, resulting in a more productive and engaged workforce. This can enhance the labour market's efficiency by matching individuals to roles that suit their skills and motivations. As both parties find better alignments—employers with more capable workers and employees with more fitting roles—the dynamic can lead to a Pareto optimal outcome, optimising human resources without disadvantage. However, not every job change achieves Pareto efficiency. Even in cases where a job move proves advantageous for the employee, employers may bear expenses associated with the recruitment, employment and training of new staff members. This could result in a short-term disadvantage for the company. An employee may occasionally depart with important institutional knowledge that the employer finds difficult to replace, which could put the employer in a worse situation. Nepali employers need to carefully assess the advantages and disadvantages of this growing trend and be better prepared to manage it effectively. \nFrom 1977 to 2007, in the process of expanding the Shuklaphanta Wildlife Reserve, now a national park in Sudurpaschim Province, thousands of families were displaced. The Ministry of Forest and Environment rehabilitated 5,200 families in camps inside the park, quite close to the wildlife. Citing safety concerns, over the past 22 years, hundreds of families have sought a way out of the national park. Yet they don’t know where to go or what to do next. Shuklaphanta is an example of a recurring national problem. Every year, disasters, both natural and manmade, leave thousands of Nepali families without proper shelters. Seldom has the state taken an initiative for their quick and proper rehabilitation. What’s at stake is the security and well-being of the displaced people. Temporary shelters and settlement areas are not as protective as permanent ones, leaving those displaced from Shuklaphanta vulnerable to the attacks of wild animals and other natural calamities. Dealing with wild animals in the national park has become a daily struggle. And their settlement in the conservation area has also proved detrimental to wildlife. Following last year’s Jajarkot earthquake, hundreds of families had to put up in temporary huts. Come monsoon, things only got worse, holed up as they were in their leaky tents. Lest we forget, during winter, many earthquake victims died due to cold. Pretty much the same could now be true in the case of those displaced by the wildlife reserve. Over the years, multiple judicial commissions—33 in total—have been formed in Sudurpaschim province to address the Shuklaphanta rehabilitation issue. Yet none has done anything substantive other than count the number of displaced families—1,480 of them. But a coordinator for the displaced families claims the number is 2,473, accusing the commission of deliberately downplaying the number of the displaced. Similar inefficiencies plague disaster rehabilitation efforts across the country. Discrepancies in government records and actual numbers often result in relief materials either failing to reach the needy or piling up unused. As concerning is the disappearance of funds meant for rehabilitation programmes. Even after the 2015 earthquake, many donor agencies were concerned that corruption would hamper rebuilding—and it did. The 30th commission in Shuklaphanta proposed to provide each displaced family with 0.338 hectares of land or Rs6 million in compensation. But that recommendation was never seriously considered. As a result, the victims have long lost faith in these commissions. It is thus vital that any new initiative be taken only after gaining the victims’ trust. Rehabilitation of course isn’t something that can be done in haste. It takes time and thought-out measures. Yet proper rehabilitation is seldom the state’s priority, as those in the government prefer to try out much easier temporary fixes rather than rigorously work on the same issue for months or even years on end. The displaced individuals, who are already mentally and physically traumatised, shouldn’t have to suffer more. Each and every Nepali has the constitutional right to live with dignity and it is the state’s responsibility to ensure the same. Really, a government that is incapable of looking after its weak and vulnerable people does not deserve to be called democratic.  \nEvery year, on the eve of Dashain, Tihar and Chhath, the triumvirate of Nepal’s biggest festivals, market prices shoot up, shadowing the festive mood. This year too, the prices of essential goods such as rice, edible oil, legumes and lentils are already soaring. To make matters worse, both long-range buses and airlines hike ticket prices, making the journey home a financial burden for many. Goods prices are really not consumer-friendly. Even the supposedly low-cost goods from China are now out of reach of many families. Let us not even get started on the price of gold, which only the super-rich can now afford. While it is natural for international trends to influence market prices, the bigger problem in Nepal are opportunistic traders and middlemen who are freely fleecing consumers in the absence of proper market supervision. Take the recent price hike in edible oil. When India, Nepal’s all-important trade partner, increased the basic import tax on crude and edible oils by 25 percent, Nepali importers seized on the opportunity to increase the price of edible oil, even when the government of Nepal had not increased its import taxes on oil. As a result, sunflower oil, which was Rs190 a litre last week, is now being sold at Rs210 a litre; mustard oil, which was going at Rs350 a litre, now costs Rs370 for the same amount. Rice prices have also increased by an average of Rs100kg (for a 25 kg bag). In the next few weeks, the prices could get steeper still. In response, the government has started operating fair-priced shops across the country to help people tide over festive times. However, such festival-time intervention will not be enough to stop unscrupulous businesses from arbitrarily setting prices. Only if there is periodic monitoring of the market will the effort seem credible and businesses take it seriously. Moreover, according to consumer rights activists, just inspecting retail markets is not enough. To prevent unscrupulous trade, the warehouses of larger importers and traders where goods are stocked for supply must also come under regular inspections.Then there is the matter of added travel costs. Domestic flight fares rise due to increased demand during festivals. For instance, the usual one-way airfare for Kathmandu-Dhangadhi is Rs7,900, but travellers will have to pay Rs13,300 between October 10-12 this year. Those who book tickets ahead of time get to travel on the standard fare, but those in emergencies are bound to suffer. Travel via the roads is another concern during festivals as the transport management department, which has issued directives for safe and comfortable travel, has refused to increase the number of passenger buses. This has allowed the current bus operators to overcharge passengers. Ease of travel is a basic right and it cannot be solely left to the logic of supply and demand, especially during the festive times when all people long to be with their loved ones. Several studies, including one by the National Consumer Forum, a consumer rights body, reckon Nepal’s market is comparably more expensive than markets of similar economies. Festive time or not, only year-round market monitoring, intervention and penalties for scrupulous operators can ease the growing financial burden on people.  \nOn Sunday, Nepal’s Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli met his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. Although there was little in terms of outcomes, it was nonetheless an important meeting. Top Indian leaders and bureaucrats have been reluctant to engage with Oli following his 2020 initiative to insert into the Nepali national charter a map of Nepal incorporating Kalapani. The Indians were also upset, unsurprisingly, when Oli, during his previous stint as prime minister, mocked the official Indian emblem, saying it represented the adage ‘Singhamev Jayate’ (power alone triumphs) rather than ‘Satyamev Jayate’ (truth alone triumphs). Separately, the CPN-UML chief riled the BJP establishment when he baselessly claimed that Lord Ram was born in Nepal’s Thori rather than India’s Ayodhya. So India has good reasons not to trust Oli. Yet the way it was consistently rebuffing Oli’s recent overtures for a bilateral meeting with Modi was unbecoming too. The Indians may not particularly like Oli, ‘China’s man’ in the reckoning of many Indian analysts. Yet they also cannot refuse to engage with the elected leader of a traditionally close partner country. Given the closeness of their relationship, Nepal and India have no option but to continue to engage at all levels, at all times. For instance, Sunday’s meeting may not have led to anything more substantive than Modi’s assurance that he will soon visit Nepal. But just the fact that the two leaders met is loaded with symbolism. India, which claims undisputed leadership of South Asia, cannot fulfil that role by sidelining the democratically elected leaders of its neighbouring countries. Such an approach will also be a mockery of Modi’s Neighbourhood First policy. It is vital for heads of government to talk as that sends a positive message down the official chain of command, opening up many new avenues of cooperation. For Oli, the meeting was also a matter of optics. Just like Modi likes to buttress his image at home by presenting himself as a rock star in his mass rallies abroad, Nepali leaders do so through their engagements with top world leaders, particularly those of India and China. Prime Minister Oli will now no doubt play up his meeting with Modi, while trying to rubbish the claim that India somehow wants to see him gone soon.Whatever the case, it is wonderful that the Nepali and Indian prime ministers are talking. This time, the Nepali side could not discuss its preferred issues like Kalapani and Eminent Persons' Group (EPG). But these issues can be brought up at different bilateral mechanisms between the two countries that the two prime ministers agreed to revive on Sunday. In the larger scheme of things, India’s leadership of the South Asian region has again come under scrutiny following the ignominious fall of one of its darlings, Sheikh Hasina of Bangladesh. The lesson for New Delhi is clear enough: Stop trying to pick favourites in the neighbourhood. That will only backfire in the long run. A better course of action for India would be to continue to engage all democratic constituencies in the region and let the democratic process take its own natural course—be it in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka or Nepal. On the part of Nepali leaders, they must forswear their dual nature whereby they become the most ardent anti-India critics, only to later try to cosy up to New Delhi when it is politically expedient for them to do so.  \nNepal’s economy that has been facing one after another setbacks since the 2015 earthquake has been struggling to bounce back. Last week, two international agencies—the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB)—announced that Nepal’s economy was poised to improve in the upcoming fiscal year. In this context, the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Nara Bahadur Thapa, former executive director of the research department of Nepal Rastra Bank, to discuss the current state of the national economy. The ADB, in its report last week, anticipated Nepal’s economy to grow by 4.9 percent this fiscal. A few days earlier, a visiting IMF team also painted an improving picture of Nepal’s economy. How do you see these projections?Nepal’s economic growth in the past 2-3 years has remained below 5 percent. But successive governments in their fiscal budgets have been setting the target of 6 to 7 percent growth. Also, the budget this year has aimed for 6 percent growth. In the meantime, two donor agencies have painted an improving picture of our economy. The ADB has anticipated 4.9 percent growth. Also, the IMF’s team that visited Nepal on a fact finding mission has projected better prospects. They expected better yield from the agriculture sector as Nepal is witnessing more rains. Last year, the growth of agriculture was 3 percent. Now they expect the sector may grow by 3.5 to 4 percent and that may lift overall growth. They have cited improvement in tourism and increased energy export as other bases. Based on these grounds, the ADB has projected 4.9 percent economic growth. But even the target of 5 percent growth looks ambitious if you analyse economic data available as of now and the steps taken by government agencies. We have witnessed more rain but that doesn’t always do us good. More rain in the late monsoon often damages paddy at the time of harvest. Second, the heavy monsoon has caused huge losses in our infrastructure such as roads and bridges that are vital to keep the daily lives and trade running. This may impact potential economic growth as some vital highways and roads have been badly damaged. These factors may pose a challenge in achieving the targets set by the government and donor agencies. Another important factor is that the ratio of capital formation to GDP [gross domestic product] is consistently decreasing. It was 33.8 in the fiscal year 2018-19, it decreased to 30.5 in 2019-20, to 29.3 in 2020-21, 29.0 in 2021-22, 25.1 in 2022-23 and 24.5 in 2023-24. How can we expect economic growth when capital formation keeps decreasing. We can’t achieve 6 percent growth without first improving the situation of capital formation. Capital formation in the private sector is on a decline and the government hasn’t been able to boost it. On the other hand, capital expenditure was lower in the past fiscal year in comparison to the previous fiscal. There is no strong sign of increasing capital formation even in the coming year. This is because the government has failed to collect revenue as per its own target. The revenue collection ratio is falling. It has come down to 18 percent of GDP, from 22 percent not so long ago. With this, the government’s funding capacity is continuously declining. It has failed even to fulfil its own duties. For instance, it hasn’t been able to pay health insurance bills and or the contractors. Similarly, credit offtake from private banks to the private sector has not increased from 6 percent. It used to be around 15-16 percent. Also, no substantive initiatives have been taken to improve productivity. For this, government agencies have to cut red tape. The private sector isn’t optimistic. We are talking a lot but not working seriously to lay a strong ground for growth.What are the signs that private investors are pessimistic?There is enough liquidity in the banks, and the interest rate is decreasing, but the private sector is not borrowing. Bankers say there is no demand from the sector. This indicates pessimism. None of the big business houses have launched any big projects in recent times. The government talks a lot about the energy sector but it is not doing power purchase agreements (PPAs) with hydropower project developers. We aren’t doing enough to realise the goal of exporting 10,000MW electricity to India. This shows no serious effort is being made to initiate reforms. The capital market has required some urgent reforms. But the government hasn’t appointed office bearers in the regulatory body for the past seven months. The government hasn’t given permission to issue IPOs and FPOs. Hence, the government is keeping two important sectors—energy and capital market—on hold. All these trends and activities suggest it will be a challenge to achieve even moderate economic growth.You pointed to the policy hurdles but the multilateral agencies have hailed the government for policy reforms. The IMF in its statement has welcomed recent amendments to various laws and the ADB has welcomed “the cautiously accommodative monetary policy”. Don’t these statements reflect reality?While making their positions public, the international agencies follow certain norms and criteria. First, they take macro pictures such as the government’s commitments. They take the pledges made by the government in the investment summit seriously. They think the commitments will be implemented. Second, they don’t want to irk the host country by presenting a bleak picture because they are diplomats. They point out possible pitfalls during bilateral and table talks but present themselves diplomatically while making their official statements public.Remittance, tourism and energy export are taken as major bases for economic growth but all three depend on external factors. How reliable can the projection be?Without trading and increasing exports, we can’t progress economically. We need to export to increase production and create jobs. Export is an engine of economic growth. Anyhow, we must increase exports. About your query, the government should tackle such things by strengthening relations with the countries concerned and devise policies and strategies accordingly.Our economy is increasingly dependent on remittance. How risky is it in the long run?Remittance has become a boon for our economy. It has played a tremendous role in poverty reduction. The first Nepal Living Standard Survey (NLSS) conducted by the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS)—now the National Statistics Office—in 1995-96 showed 42 percent Nepali population living below the poverty line. The latest [fourth] living standard survey has shown the poverty level at 20 percent. It wouldn’t be possible without remittance. Therefore, we can’t undermine the role of remittance in this social transformation. Were not the government’s plans and policies responsible for this achievement?The government role would not have been enough. What government policies have created jobs in Nepal? Are there any schemes worth mentioning? The industrialisation hasn’t increased. It is the industrial sector that creates jobs but the share of the manufacturing sector has come down to 4.87 percent in total GDP. Some years ago, it was nearly 9-10 percent. It shows our economy is being deindustrialised. How can we reduce poverty without providing jobs to the youths? Thus, foreign employment played a vital role in poverty reduction. Second is the role of remittance in maintaining foreign exchange reserves, which is essential to buy things from abroad. We have sufficient foreign exchange reserves because of remittance.Information Technology is now projected as a promising sector in creating jobs and transforming Nepal’s economy. How realistic is this expectation?Four fields can be taken as promising sectors in Nepal—agriculture, tourism, IT and hydropower. The IT sector certainly has a bright future. As our country is land-locked, we have additional challenges in merchandise exports and we can’t be competitive. The IT sector won’t have that barrier so it can be competitive in the international market. But for that the government has to formulate IT-friendly policies. For instance, if a Kathmandu-based Nepali firm wants to sell services in the US, Europe or any other international market, they need liaison offices in those countries. Otherwise, they can’t be competitive and grow. But the government doesn’t provide foreign exchange for them to expand their business abroad.Without this policy reform, Nepalis can’t compete with IT companies from other countries. Similarly, foreign companies need to come and work here so that Nepali youths can learn from them. Foreign banks came to Nepal and Nepali bankers learned. Now Nepali banks are doing good. But our policies aren’t favourable for foreigners interested in setting up IT firms. Also, well-trained IT workers are in shortage. We are progressing but we have to put in extra effort to make transformative changes in this sector.The cooperatives’ scam has emerged as a serious issue. What impact may it cause in the national economy if it’s not resolved soon?The cooperative sector played a vital role in creating financial inclusion in our economy by making 7.3 million people its members. Those who couldn’t do their regular transactions with banks were engaged with cooperatives. If that sector collapses, our state of financial inclusion will decline too. Second, they were major financiers for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME). Cooperatives are directly linked to entrepreneurship through MSMEs. They played a role in making interest rates of banks more competitive as well as banks and financial institutions were under pressure by the interest rates offered by cooperatives. Now they won’t feel the pressure.In this context, many people may resort to informal transactions. According to the 16th periodic plan, nearly 50 percent of Nepal’s economy is informal. We are under pressure to reduce the portion of the informal economy. But the crisis in the cooperative sector may increase the informal economy as those who were involved in cooperatives, which is a formal sector, are likely to do informal transactions with traders or other individuals.Cooperatives are not well regulated and there are anomalies but they are registered in a government agency, pay taxes, have offices and a record system. They brought people in far-flung villages under a formal channel. If the depositors resort to individual transactions, their money will be unsafe. The constitution accepted them as one of the three pillars—along with the government and the private sector—of the country’s economy. The sector expanded its network where there were no economic activities from the government and private sectors. For instance, the government was providing certain services such as distributing fertilisers, crop seeds, sugar through cooperatives. People will now be deprived of these services. Also, the commercial banks might face complications due to the domino effect of the cooperative scam. For instance, if the government seizes the land put up by a cooperative as a collateral in a bank and sells it to return the deposits, the bank might be in trouble.It is also said that cooperatives were becoming platforms for money laundering. How serious was the problem?Cooperatives didn’t seek a source of money from the depositors while accepting big deposits. They weren’t affiliated to the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of the central bank and the Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT). Therefore, there is a problem of money laundering. It can be resolved when they get affiliated with the FIU.What initiatives should be taken to address the problems seen in the cooperative sector?A powerful regulatory authority should be established without delay. The authority should work as a dedicated agency to clear the mess. Then, AML/CFT provisions should be implemented, a credit information centre should be set up and a debt recovery tribunal formed, and deposits guaranteed. The concept of self-regulation isn’t enough. These financial infrastructures are essential. \nThe parliamentary special probe committee formed to investigate cooperatives scam submitted its report last week. The government has already started implementing the report. In this context, Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with the committee chair Surya Thapa for more insights on the probe’s findings and the anomalies in the cooperative sector they saw during the investigation.After your committee submitted the report on cooperatives scam, people have interpreted its findings in different ways. Why the confusion?Our committee prepared, finalised and endorsed the report unanimously. No member registered any dissent. This is an important point. However, people have interpreted its findings a bit differently. The supporters of [Rastriya Swatantra Party chair] Rabi Lamichhane have tried to make it appear like the report has given him a clean chit. They have selectively taken a certain portion of the report which states that Lamichhane’s involvement couldn’t be formally established in the process of transferring funds from cooperatives to the Gorkha Media Network. But a huge amount of money has been provided to the Gorkha Media Network from various cooperatives against the Cooperative Act 2017, which prohibits investment of cooperative deposits to any company. It is seen that Lamichhane is directly involved in spending the funds collected from the cooperatives. Based on that, we have found chair of the media company Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai, the then managing director Rabi Lamichhane, directors Chhabilal Joshi and Kumar Ramtel directly responsible in the misuse of cooperative funds and have asked the government to take action against them as per the existing laws. The aforementioned two aspects are inextricably linked. We didn’t find any evidence of transfer of cooperative funds to Lamichhane’s personal bank account. It is sent to the bank account of the Gorkha Media Network. The KYC form of the Global IME Bank shows that Lamichhane is one of the three holders of the joint account. Any one of the three can issue cheques from the account. The funds invested as loan in the Gorkha Media Network have been transferred to the joint bank account, from where Lamichhane has released money by signing cheques. This is how Lamichhane is directly involved in embezzlement of the cooperative funds. Many argue that as per the cooperative law only those who release money from the cooperatives are held responsible but not those who spend it after it is received at the company. Is that the case?The Cooperative Act 2017 prohibits releasing any loan to a company. But it is sent to the company, where Lamichhane is an owner with 15 percent share and a managing director. And, the money is misused there. An informal statement of GB Rai shows Rs1.20 billion of cooperative deposits has been invested in the media company while our financial analysis shows the amount is Rs654 million. Evidence shows Rs220 million has been directly sent to the media company’s bank account. Depositors have been deprived of their money. Other staff working at the company aren’t responsible but the owners are. They could be charged with cooperative fraud under the Cooperative Act, fraud and duping under the National Penal Code, organised crime cases under the Organised Crime Prevention Act, and money laundering cases under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. Some individuals involved with various cooperatives including Roshni Gurung of a Butwal-based cooperative told the committee that they deposited millions of rupees in the bank account of a person named Rabi Lamichhane. Kumar Ramtel said the person named Rabi Lamichhane is none other than the Rastriya Swatantra Party chair. Still, the committee couldn’t establish the link. What is the complication?The flow of the money shows the connection but documents to link the transactions are not available. We didn’t find documents with Lamichhane’s signatures and fingerprints that needed to be submitted to get a loan. All the seven cooperatives run by GB Rai were releasing loans without following due procedure. But we have successfully traced the flow of the money. The loan amount created in the name of Rabi Lamichhane in Butwal and deposited by Roshni Gurung had reached the Gorkha Media Network’s bank account which was jointly operated by GB Rai, Rabi Lamichhane and Chhabilal Joshi. This is an established fact. The committee didn’t find any document showing the flow of cooperative money to his personal account. But that alone is insufficient to give him a clean chit as a huge sum has been sent to the media company’s bank account jointly run by three people including Lamichhane. Another sum from the Supreme Cooperative has been deposited to the bank account of Gorkha Media Network. The bank voucher shows Roshni Gurung/Rabi Lamichhane as depositors. The amount also goes to the same joint account.Now the government has forwarded the report to the investigation agencies. Do you think the agencies can unearth the missing documents?Our committee worked in a different way to regular House committees. We followed methods of investigation just like the police investigation agencies and government’s prosecution agencies do. We recorded the suspects’ statements, took their fingerprints, and got the signatures to authenticate their statements. I believe this is a new practice by a Nepali parliamentary committee. Sufficient evidence has already been gathered in the past as well. While carrying out this task and preparing the 1,124-page document, we have followed the norms and procedures of an investigation body.During the interrogation, many suspects told the committee that they knew nothing and shifted the responsibility to GB Rai, who is on the run. Those from seven cooperatives–Hamro Nayakrishi Multipurpose Cooperatives; Swarnalaxmi; Supreme; Suryadarshan; Sahara; Samanata and Sano Paila and the officials from Gorkha Media Network gave such answers. Their common answer is, “I don’t know about this, GB Rai does.” Many of them might have been trying to evade their responsibility by blaming Rai. The government has failed to produce Rai. Won’t this investigation be incomplete in his absence?Based on its facts and evidence, the investigation report is complete. Yes, 29 suspects including GB Rai are at large. They are believed to be staying abroad. Their statements have not been recorded. But that doesn’t make the investigation incomplete. We have accessed the database of Gorkha Media Network and other cooperative organisations, collected important documents and analysed them. There is no confusion about the money embezzled in the scam. We have determined a total of Rs2.58 billion from various cooperatives has been misused by investing in several organisations including the Gorkha Media Network, Nature Nest, Nature Herbs, Gorkha Group of Investment, Gorkha Ayurved Company—49 people were responsible for these investments, including GB Rai. Of that, Rs654 million has been invested in Gorkha Media Network. A total of Rs8 billion has been embezzled in the seven cooperatives where Rai is involved. So the investigation is complete. During the interrogation, some office bearers of cooperatives claimed they had no role in the transactions as they were dummy officials and GB Rai and some individuals Rai trusted did everything. How convincing is that?The practice of creating dummy officials, fake documents, false marriages and divorces etcetera is rampant in the cooperative sector. In the seven cooperatives GB Rai is at the centre. He has at least one key person in each of these seven cooperatives as chair or manager and carries out everything through them. In some of them, the chairpersons know nothing. The cooperatives don’t follow any norms, rules and regulations of cooperatives. They work just on the basis of orders they get from Rai or his trusted individuals over the phone. Rai gets advice from a California-based individual named Gyan Bahadur Bamjan. The Cooperative Act prohibits an individual from being a member of more than one cooperative but Rai is involved in at least seven cooperatives as a chair, secretary, vice-chair or patron.The government has decided to implement the report. How should the state agencies work to bring good results?The government should immediately initiate action against four persons—Rabi Lamichhane, GB Rai, Chhabilal Joshi and Kumar Ramtel—as the report has found them responsible for misusing cooperative funds. We have also determined the roles and responsibilities of around 1,000 individuals who were chair, vice-chairs, secretaries, treasurers, account chiefs or others who in decision making roles in 40 cooperatives we were tasked to investigate. They should be brought under investigation and their properties should be seized so as to create an environment to return the depositors’ money.Different arrangements need to be made about those who are in judicial custody. They should be released, their all documents including passports seized and they should be kept under surveillance and allowed to take initiatives to return the depositors’ money. The government, while unveiling the fiscal budget, had announced to take initiatives to return deposits upto Rs500,000 by keeping cooperatives’ assets as collateral. This process should be expedited. Likewise, the government should set up an all-powerful regulatory authority. At present, all the 753 local governments, seven provincial governments and the federal government have the regulatory role. That is pointless. Now a strong dedicated regulatory authority should be formed. The Crisis-ridden Cooperatives Management Committee is there but it should be made more effective by giving it greater executive powers. When a cooperative is in crisis, the regulatory body should take over its management and fix the crisis just like Nepal Rastra Bank does in the banking sector.What patterns of anomalies did you find in the cooperatives?The fundamental idea of a cooperative is to run by its own members based on self-regulation. But a few board members were found to be using all the authority and misusing the funds while members were unaware about the affairs in the organisations. The board members use most of the resources for their relatives and other closed ones. Annual meetings are organised as picnics and wedding parties. In some cases, annual meetings are fake, audit reports, auditors and signatures, all are fake.In the course of preparing the committee report, I have coined terms like ‘cooperative divorce’ and ‘cooperative marriage’. Divorce and marriage documents are prepared based on the fortune of the cooperatives. There was misappropriation of Rs120 million in a cooperative, where Jyoti Gurung was manager, in 2075 BS. Dhan Raj Gurung, who is Nepali Congress Vice-president, divorced his wife Jyoti in 2076 BS. But, in 2077, Dhan Raj presented himself as a guarantor of a loan to Jyoti. Again in 2080, both of them jointly paid back a loan of Rs9.1 million. This is a bit of a trend in the cooperative sector.Do you think we need to reconsider the basic idea of cooperatives as self-regulated organisations?In the report, we haven’t questioned its principle, need and importance. Cooperative sector is vital for our economy. But the concept of self-regulation as stated in the Cooperative Act 2017 has failed. Now, this sector should be overseen by a strong regulatory body. Still, the idea of self-regulation can be given continuity as the members should be allowed to run the cooperatives on their own but their activities should be strictly regulated by a powerful authority. Moreover, the cooperatives that do big transactions should be regulated by the central bank.Why did the present regulatory bodies fail?There were over 50 lawmakers who proudly identified themselves as office bearers of certain cooperatives. They over-emphasised self-regulation and undermined the role of regulatory bodies. Individuals like GB Rai and other fraudsters benefited from that. Therefore, we recommended stringent laws and a stronger regulatory authority. \nNepal is marking its ninth Constitution Day on Thursday. The country’s two largest parties—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—formed a coalition government a month ago with a commitment to reviewing and amending the constitution. In this context, Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal and Binod Ghimire sat down with constitutional expert Purna Man Shakya to discuss the good and bad aspects of the constitution amendment process.The Congress and the UML have floated a proposal to amend the constitution. Is the time ripe to make changes in our statute?Generally, constitutions are reviewed after around a decade of their implementation. So, we have come to the stage of reviewing whether our constitution has functioned properly. However, the sudden announcement of the amendment is premature, as this is a serious business. In our case, the constitution can’t be amended just based on the interest of one or two parties. It requires a national consensus. There should be an understanding among the political parties represented in Parliament. And, a sort of consensus even among the people’s level is important as there was huge public involvement in making this constitution. Sentiment of various communities must be respected while making any changes in the national charter. What can be the modality of seeking consensus at the people’s level? Should a draft be prepared and opened up for debate?While making changes in the constitution, some issues might be technical and not of interest to common people. But if any changes are made in policy issues that can alter our country’s structural dynamics, the concerned communities must be consulted. Just the present strength of the political parties represented in Parliament is no guarantee that they truly represent people. For instance, the Maoists emerged as the largest party through the election in 2008. But it has been shrunk to a distant third in the House. However, we can’t conclude from this that the people have discarded the party’s agenda. The Maoists might have been discredited due to their activities and failure in delivery but people might still favour the agenda they once championed. Similar is the case with other parties. Therefore, we have to consider broader consensus both in Parliament as well as the people’s level.How challenging is it to enter the constitution amendment process?Any amendment calls for a two-thirds majority in the House of Representatives as well as the National Assembly in the federal parliament. If an issue is linked to provincial authority, it should be endorsed by the majority [four] of seven provinces. So, this is not easy. Therefore, the parties should tread carefully.You mentioned earlier that constitution amendments without a review process is not a right step. Could you elaborate?The right way is to first have broad understanding among the top leaders of political forces on the issues and then constitute a panel of experts to conduct a comprehensive study on that. Such studies are conducted through two methods—doctrinal and non-doctrinal. The doctrinal method analyses related literature and principles on theoretical approach while the non-doctrinal method studies the public sentiments and opinions through surveys and interactions, and comes up with certain methodologies with the help of subject experts. Through such study, the experts identify the issues and recommend the ways to the politicians. This is the right process.There are also arguments that reviewing the constitution without even bringing it into full-fledged implementation is wrong. Based on the practice during these years, we have concluded that certain provisions didn’t work properly. It is true that we are talking about making changes in the constitution without even implementing certain provisions. First we have to give the system an opportunity to work in a full-fledged way. Then, we can evaluate whether it worked. Any move to dissolve the system without properly implementing it will create divisions and invite another conflict. A question that is often asked: Is there a problem with our constitution or with our politicians? People can change the constitution but the constitution can’t change the people. Therefore, a constitution should be developed also on the basis of the nature of people in the country who use it. If our political parties and the politicians had reformed themselves, we might not have had to discuss constitutional changes time and again. We should have made the system strong for more effective checks and balances and made leaders and officials more accountable. The ruling parties reason that the constitution amendment became necessary to ensure political stability.When a federal government is changed, its aftershocks are immediately seen in all seven provincial governments. It directly impacts development and other activities across the country. It’s a flaw in our party system but we have to find a solution in the system. We see people raising voices for two things—stability and retirement of old politicians. As Nepali politicians never retire voluntarily, we have to address it through the system. Direct election of executive head can be one way to address this problem. People have found local governments more effective than federal and provincial governments. It is because chiefs and representatives of local governments are directly elected and they can serve the full five-year term.Once people are given the right to elect heads of government, they won’t elect old faces such as KP Oli, Sher Bahadur Deuba and Prachanda [Pushpa Kamal Dahal], who have been tested multiple times. It will serve two purposes—first, it gives stability and second, it allows popular leaders to emerge in place of the old ones. The old leaders have maintained control over national politics through their huge party organisations. But when people directly elect presidents and chief ministers their grip over party organisations can’t be decisive in national politics. For that we have to amend the constitution.However, again, an expert team needs to thoroughly study the pros and cons of such changes. But what I can say based on the general study of public perception is that we can first go for direct election of executive heads at the provincial level. In the next phase we can go for direct presidential election at the federal level.What went wrong in the practice of the three-tier federal system?While adopting federalism, the basic idea was to allow the local governments to oversee local matters while the provincial governments would handle wide ranges of issues related to agriculture, industry, forest, education and health, etcetera. If the two sub-national governments handle these things, people don’t need to come to the centre seeking solutions to their problems. In such a scenario, the federal government can focus on important affairs such as foreign relations, defence, telecommunication, currency, national infrastructure projects and inter-provincial affairs. Such division of powers would automatically create specialisation in the respective governments.But the federal system is not implemented as per that spirit. Provinces aren’t allowed to exercise their rights. People are still travelling to Kathmandu all the way from remote districts even for basic things. The constitution has mandated the provinces to maintain law and order in their respective provinces but the federal government hasn’t allowed them to have their own police forces. Provinces without police have become like administrative units. The centre has a huge bureaucracy in Kathmandu. It is high time that the centre delegates authority to provinces as per the constitutional spirit. Federal lawmakers have huge interest in local development activities because it is directly related to their election. They don’t want to lose this influence. The interest of federal lawmakers however contradicts with the constitution.There is also a belief that the local level has authority in areas where they can’t work effectively, for instance they are mandated to oversee the education system up to grade 12 while provinces don’t have much role. Do you think such jurisdictional matters need to be reviewed and provinces should be given more authority?That’s right. First of all, we should be clear that there is no point in adopting a federal system if we don’t want provinces because we had central and local levels even in the past. Provincial layer is an integral part of federalism. So, we have to think about transferring certain rights from local to provincial level because the local units don’t have expertise to oversee education up to grade 12 on their own. Our local units are traditionally trained in local development activities. But now they are entrusted with the responsibility of not only overseeing education and health issues but also with legislative and judicial functions. They haven’t been able to play that role. We should think about transferring some roles from local to provincial levels. Likewise, the centre should be ready to allow the provinces to exercise their rights bestowed by the constitution. It is time to strengthen the provinces.You said direct election of executive heads in provinces could end instability at the provincial level. But what if a popular leader got elected chief minister but other political parties won majority seats in the provincial assemblies? In such a situation, the rival parties may not help the chief minister pass a budget or policies from the assembly.Yes, there are strengths and weaknesses of all systems. Such problems can be resolved because we see similar situations in other countries as well. Parties can’t prolong the deadlock in the House because they will be blamed for the impasse. One basis is that our local units are doing well under executive heads. So, we can practise it for a decade in the provinces and then apply it to the federal level based on that experience.Many forces and groups that aren’t happy with the present constitution, which was basically a compromise document. Once the constitution amendment process is open, they are certain to revive their demands. Will the situation be manageable?If the rights of historically marginalised communities are curtailed, they will certainly retaliate. If you try to go against the federal republic system and policy of inclusion, it may invite new conflicts. The proportional representation system is not a problem. Leaders made it unpopular by misusing it. We should find solutions to stop its misuse. We shouldn’t forget that this constitution is not only a constitution but also a key document of our peace process. This is not perfect but it was essential to end the conflict. Many say that while making a document of compromise, our constitution hasn’t followed the principles of constitutionalism. For instance, the hearing system is something unusual in a parliamentary system. As a constitutional expert, do you think we should also think about fixing such deviations?You are right. When we couldn’t change the people, we tried to add additional features as a measure to check the wrongdoings. Our leaders make appointments in key constitutional bodies guided by their personal and partisan interests. We copied the hearing practice from the presidential system with a view to check the leaders’ arbitrary appointments. It hasn’t been that effective. Therefore, we have proposed to give continuity to the hearing for political appointments but not in the appointments of judges because lawmakers don’t have the expertise to examine judges’ competence. Since lawmakers are mainly guided by the party’s whip and top leaders’ instructions, it rather increases political interference even in the judiciary. We have thus proposed to stop the hearing process for judges’ appointments.Many say that the judiciary hasn’t been federalized even though all other sectors have been restructured as per the three-tier federal system. Why this exception for the judiciary?Oh, you dragged me to a sensitive topic. One thing we shouldn’t forget is that we adopted a federal system not to unify small countries. We were already a united country. We adopted it to better manage our social diversity by involving all the communities in the governing system. We at the same time have to safeguard the country from disintegration. Judiciary, the national army and Nepali language are our institutional arrangements that can play a unifying role. Therefore, we didn’t make much changes in these three aspects.Some instances show that Nepal’s federalism might have been a bit more effective had the judiciary worked proactively. For instance, the court hasn’t decided even the cases filed by provinces years ago. What do you think about the judiciary’s role in this connection?Yes, those cases are still undecided. In the Constituent Assembly, the Maoist party had registered a proposal to form a separate constitutional court. The justices who were leading the judiciary at the time opposed the idea. It was later rejected. Then the idea to have a separate constitutional bench was included as a compromise deal. But it has failed to work effectively. It failed to decide election-related disputes. We have to review its jurisdiction. They have decided certain cases when there is public pressure. For instance they decided cases like House dissolution because there was constant public scrutiny. But they haven’t shown any interest in other important cases where constitutional interpretation is needed. Of late, a strong opinion is being built in favour of forming a separate constitutional court. These issues are being discussed seriously. This issue may emerge if the constitution amendment process begins.What we can infer from your analysis is that the constitution amendment process is not that easy. What are the basic things that should be and can be done in the constitution amendment at this stage?First, we should change the form of governance at the provincial level and go for a directly elected executive head. With this there will be no change in government in provinces after changes at the centre. The governments in provinces can work for five years with certainty. Second, we can transfer the powers that the local units have failed to exercise to provinces. And, the centre should allow the provinces to exercise the concurrent rights. By doing this the centre can reduce the overwhelming burden on it. While the provinces can play an implementing role, the federation can play a supervisory role. These things need to be fixed. We need some amendments to the constitution and some new laws for this. \nNepal has often earned global recognition for its progressive policies and inclusive stance on LGBTQIA+ rights. But do the global accolades Nepal has earned in terms of its progressiveness reflect the actual experiences of queer people here? The Post’s Aarati Ray sat down with Manisha Dhakal, executive director of the Blue Diamond Society and a leading advocate for LGBTQIA+ rights in South Asia for over 23 years.Nepal is often hailed for its progressive stance on queer rights, both in South Asia and globally. With over two decades of queer rights advocacy, how accurate do you find this portrayal?Many activists and commentators do describe Nepal as being progressive on queer rights. While this is partly true, especially when we consider the legal frameworks, the reality at the grassroots is quite different. On the one hand, Nepal’s constitution recognises LGBTQIA+ identities. Articles 12 and 18 mandate that “gender identity” be acknowledged on citizenship certificates, while Article 42 promises affirmative action and participation in government for sexual and gender minorities. Court decisions in Nepal, too, have been favourable for LGBTQIA+ rights, and unlike many former British colonies with Section 377-type laws that criminalise queer communities, Nepal has no such legal barriers. So, indeed, there are opportunities for activism, and progress has been made, particularly in terms of legal recognition. But, again, the rights enshrined in the constitution and affirmed by the courts have not been realised at the grassroots level. We are stuck with a limited focus, primarily on citizenship. The state claims that we’ve been given the right to identity and legal recognition, but even this is not fully realised. For example, the process of obtaining citizenship based on self-identification remains difficult, with government officials still unclear on how to implement these provisions. The broader narrative of Nepal being progressive is built on a superficial understanding of the situation.In August, Nepal’s Supreme Court ruled that Rukshana Kapali, a transgender woman, should be legally recognised as a woman on all documents without medical verification. How does this decision impact the future of LGBTQIA+ rights in Nepal?Rukshana’s case is a prominent victory, highlighting the judiciary’s support for LGBTQIA+ rights, especially compared to those of the executive and legislative branches. This ruling lays a strong foundation for similar future cases and will undoubtedly help in future activism. However, it’s important to note that the decision applies only to Kapali, meaning others will still need to go through the courts to have their gender identity legally recognised. How long must transgender individuals continue to endure lengthy court processes just to obtain citizenship?Even outside the courts, the bureaucratic hurdles—from medical reassignment surgeries to invasive checkups and long delays from the CDO (District Administration Office) to the Ministry of Home Affairs—can take years, with no guarantee of getting preferred names on legal documents. In many cases, even after completing the process, the names are inaccurately changed, such as altering Ram to Rama instead of the preferred name, like Manisha.We [Blue Diamond Society] get 15-20 complaints each year, primarily from transgender women, regarding difficulties in obtaining citizenship.The Supreme Court’s recent decision on same-sex marriage in Nepal has attracted global attention and gotten a positive response. Are there any limits to the court’s decision?After a long and arduous process, we secured temporary registration for same-sex marriages. On June 28, 2023, the Supreme Court, in the Pinky Gurung vs. Government of Nepal case, issued an interim order instructing the government to temporarily register same-sex marriages, including for those with “other” gender markers. That said, the Civil Code adopted in 2017 still defines marriage as a union between a ‘man’ and a ‘woman’.We, as a community, are pleased with the government’s temporary registration process. Yet it falls short of offering full marriage rights, including those related to property, adoption, and tax exemptions. While the court’s decision sets a supportive precedent, lack of clarity about the rights associated with the temporary certificate leaves many in limbo. So far, only around five couples have registered, and many in the community are hesitant to do so.The question remains: Can this temporary registration truly grant us the same recognition as heterosexual marriages? While the decision has garnered global praise, the LGBTQIA+ community on the ground continues to feel cheated of true equality. Our ultimate goal is to amend the Civil Code so that marriage is defined as a union between two individuals, rather than being restricted to one between male and female.Why do many court decisions on queer rights in Nepal, like of same-sex marriages, remain in limbo? Is this due to the government and courts trying to appease both conservative and progressive groups, or is it just a performative gesture of inclusivity?There are multiple factors at play. I think some responsibility also falls on activists. For example, when fighting for legal recognition since 2008, we should have advocated not only for the “third gender” or “other” but also for individuals who have transitioned from male to female or female to male. What’s more, policymakers and bureaucrats still lack awareness about human rights principles related to minority groups like the LGBTQIA+ community. Even though Nepal has ratified international conventions on human rights, these commitments have not been prioritised by lawmakers, which leads to this state of limbo and half-hearted inclusivity.As for the internal thought processes of bureaucrats and lawmakers, it’s hard to say. Many of them might still believe that the LGBTQIA+ community shouldn’t be granted full rights, so they engage in performative actions—appearing supportive on the surface to attract global attention but hesitating to fully advance our rights. This could explain why progress seems to stall midway.Queer rights have received some legal recognition. But how are they reflected in terms of social and cultural acceptance in Nepal?Legal changes and social acceptance need to go hand in hand. If we only focus on legal reforms without addressing societal attitudes, there will be no real change. We’ve seen this play out—there is legal recognition of gender identity, and temporary registration for same-sex marriage is available. Yet people struggle to fully realise these rights because of deep-rooted discrimination within families and society.In Nepal, a socially and culturally driven society, where family, relatives, and festivals play a major role, social acceptance is often more important than legal acceptance. When it comes to cultural acceptance, biases still persist. For example, it feels like we’re allowed to express ourselves openly only during the Pride Month in June. When we try to participate in other celebrations like Teej or Gaijatra, society often reacts negatively, asking why we need to “spoil” their festivals. This shows that social change is still lagging, despite the progress in legal rights.You mentioned that the queer community is often given the surface level of legal recognition. How is the state of the exercise of fundamental rights for LGBTQIA+ people in Nepal?Labelled as ‘gender and sexual minorities’, our broader struggles are ignored. When we raise concerns about poverty, food insecurity, or unemployment, the response we often get from government institutions and stakeholders is, “This isn’t our issue; it’s a gender problem.”We are just as much a part of society as anyone else. Issues like climate change, housing, and poverty affect us too. We want to be included in solutions, whether it’s participating in climate programs or being involved in community initiatives. Unfortunately, lawmakers and stakeholders often overlook that we are just as human as heterosexuals, with needs that go beyond legal recognition on paper.What are some aspects of the queer community that have not received enough attention in media narratives, and what tends to be unnecessarily highlighted?As I’ve mentioned before, the narrative surrounding our community often focuses heavily on issues like citizenship, while overlooking other important aspects of our lives. What’s missing is the correct representation of our contributions in various fields. Many LGBTQIA+ individuals are doctors, and experts in different professions, yet their accomplishments are only rarely acknowledged or represented. Instead, the focus often falls on the unfortunate image of some members of the community begging on the streets, which goes viral on social media.Another issue is the way we are predominantly associated with sex and sexuality. While these are important aspects of human identity, we are much more than that. We have other needs and rights that deserve attention. Unfortunately, the media tends to fixate on sexual aspects of the LGBTQIA+ community, reinforcing stereotypes. It’s time for the media to move beyond this narrow portrayal and include us in broader discussions that reflect the full scope of our lives.How has the current narrative of progressiveness in Nepal impacted real change for the LGBTQIA+ community?It’s time to move beyond this narrative of progressiveness. True progress should lead to further development, not be a barrier to it. Unfortunately, the current narrative seems to be stagnating.For instance, when we raise issues with the government, the response often is, “We’ve already given you the right to citizenship. You’re getting citizenship now.” Even when I travel people sometimes ask, “You’ve got citizenship, right? Things are becoming progressive.” This narrative of progressiveness has become an excuse for the government to claim they’ve done enough and to avoid further action.This surface-level progressiveness is used to showcase Nepal as forward-thinking internationally, but it hasn’t translated into real change for people at the grassroots. It also impedes activists’ efforts by providing the government with a shield against criticism. Until this narrative of progressiveness evolves into genuine, accountable action that goes beyond court decisions and performative gestures, it will continue to be a barrier to actual progress. \nThe weather will be partly to generally cloudy throughout the country on Monday.According to the Meteorological Forecasting Division, light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is likely to occur at a few places of the hilly regions and at one or two places of rest of the country.Tonight, it is forecast to be partly to generally cloudy in Koshi Province along with the hilly regions of rest of the country.
