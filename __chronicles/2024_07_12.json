Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nIt has been over a week since the Nepali Congress and CPN-UML agreed to form a new government under the leadership of the CPN-UML chair KP Oli, but they have yet to settle the ministry-wise portfolio division.Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who lost his majority after the UML and other parties withdrew their support, will face a vote of confidence on Friday as required by the constitution. This will be Dahal’s fifth floor test since becoming the prime minister in December 2022. It is almost certain that he will not secure the majority, which means President Ram Chandra Poudel will have to call for the formation of a new government. As soon as the prime minister fails the vote, Speaker Devraj Ghimire will inform President Poudel of the results. The UML is planning to claim the formation of the new government with the support of over two-thirds of the lawmakers, a central committee member of the party told the Post.But it is not clear whether the President will appoint Oli as the next prime minister after the UML submits the signature of the two-thirds lawmakers or he will give political parties one to three days to form a new government under Article 76 (3).President Poudel is consulting his team as well as his advisors, said an aide.As per the initial power-sharing agreement between Deuba and Oli, Congress will get 11 ministries and the UML will get 10. But as more parties have decided to extend support to Oli, they will need to accommodate other fringe parties in the government.Despite these preparations, the Congress and the UML have yet to finalise their nominees for ministers. Oli is likely to be sworn in on Tuesday once the prime minister election process is completed. Sources citing an informal agreement between the two parties said the Congress will lead the home and foreign affairs ministries, and the UML finance and defence ministries.“We are lobbying for General Secretary Gagan Thapa to lead the Congress team in the new government,” Bishwa Prakash Sharma, another general secretary of the party, told the Post. Thapa is interested to lead the Ministry of Home Affairs, but Congress chief Sher Bahadur Deuba wants Ramesh Lekhak as the new home minister, according to Congress leaders. “If Thapa leads another ministry, but is given the position of deputy prime minister, he should join the government,” said Sharma.Dozens of lawmakers have expressed their intent to become ministers this time, so the party’s leadership, including Deuba, is in a difficult situation regarding whom to send and whom not to.Deuba's spouse, Arzu Rana, is widely expected to be the next foreign minister. Other potential Congress ministers include Chandra Bhandari, Jeevan Pariyar, Tejulal Chaudhary, and Ajay Chaurasiya, among others. Besides Thapa, senior Nepali Congress leaders like Prakash Man Singh and Krishna Prasad Situala, among others, are also interested in leading the party in the new Cabinet, according to sources. General Secretary Sharma, however, told the Post that he would not join the new government. Singh, due to his senior position inside the party and the support he had extended in the past to help Deuba win the party presidency, has a high chance of leading the Congress team in the government, if General Secretary Thapa does not join the government, according to Nepali Congress leaders. Thapa has reportedly set some conditions, including deputy prime ministership, for him to lead the party’s team in the Oli Cabinet.Although Sharma claimed that they would lobby for Thapa, Thapa himself, speaking at a function in Biratnagar on Thursday, said he would not join the new government.“I have told the party leadership that I will work as general secretary and not join the government,” said Thapa.He also claimed that as soon as the process of forming the new government begins, the seven-point agreement signed between Oli and Deuba at midnight of July 1 will be made public.“We will discuss with the party president on Friday about sending the Congress team in the government under Thapa’s leadership,” said Sharma. However, UML chief Oli, who is all set to become the new prime minister, is reportedly against having the deputy prime minister portfolio this time. That is one major reason why the two parties have been unable to finalise the portfolio division.If the post of deputy prime minister remains, UML’s Bishnu Poudel, who previously served in that role, might be appointed deputy prime minister and finance minister, according to UML leaders. However, Oli is not keen on bringing Poudel into the Cabinet, according to the leaders. Padma Aryal, UML's party secretary, said a secretariat meeting of the party on Wednesday had already entrusted Oli with selecting ministers.There is also a long list of aspirants in the UML hoping to become ministers in the new Oli Cabinet. If the deputy prime minister portfolio is removed, Oli is likely to pick Rishikesh Pokhrel as the next finance minister, according to the leaders. Pokhrel is the chairman of the Public Account Committee of the House of Representatives. \nPushpa Kamal Dahal secured the vote of confidence in four consecutive tries after becoming the prime minister on December 25, 2022, but when he goes for his fifth on Friday, he is almost sure to fail.After CPN-UML, the largest coalition partner, withdrew its support to the government on July 3, Prime Minister Dahal has been leading the minority government.Soon after the UML withdrew its support, the Janata Samajbadi Party, led by Ashok Rai, also pulled the plug on the government. The CPN-UML has 77 seats and the newly formed Rai-led party has 7 seats in the House of Representatives.Dahal on July 5 decided to go for the floor test after the UML’s withdrawal of the support.Dahal opted for the floor test in accordance with Article 100(2) of the constitution which says, “If the political party which the prime minister represents is divided or a political party in coalition government withdraws its support, the prime minister shall table a motion in the House of Representatives for a vote of confidence within thirty days.”Dahal, who had the support of 268 lawmakers in his first attempt at a floor test, is likely to see that vote slashed by almost 200 this time.As things stood on Thursday, Dahal is most likely to get 32 votes from his CPN (Maoist Centre), 21 from the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) and 10 from the CPN (Unified Socialist).The parliamentary party meeting of Unified Socialist on Thursday decided to give Prime Minister Dahal the trust vote.Though the RSP has called a meeting of its parliamentary party on Friday morning, a party lawmaker said, “Since we have been continuing in the government despite being in a minority, we are morally bound to give the vote of trust to Prime Minister Dahal.”On July 4, RSP leaders had announced they’d quit the government but ministers from the party met the prime minister later that day and decided not to resign immediately. They said they backtracked on their plan after the prime minister sought their support until the floor test.To secure a majority in the 275-strong House, one needs 138 votes.The Congress and the UML, which have 88 and 77 House of Representatives seats, respectively, have already decided to vote against Prime Minister Dahal. Likewise, the Rastriya Prajantra Party, which has 14 seats, has also decided to vote against Dahal.The Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal, led by Upendra Yadav, and the Janata Samajbadi Party, led by Ashok Rai, which have 5 and 7 seats, respectively, have said they will vote against Dahal.The Loktantrik Samajbadi Party, which has four seats in the House, is also standing against Dahal during the floor test. “Our party is a member of the democratic alliance led by the Nepali Congress,” Ram Parkash Chaudhary, a lawmaker of the party, told the Post. “Therefore, we will vote against Prime Minister Dahal.”Dahal also will not get the trust vote of the Nagarik Unmukti Party. “Since our party has already withdrawn support to the Dahal government, our party will stand against him during the floor test,” Ranjita Shrestha, a lawmaker of the party, told the Post.The CK Raut-led Janamat Party, which has six seats in the lower house, will also stand against Prime Minister Dahal. “The party has already decided to stand against Prime Minister Dahal’s trust motion,” Abdul Khan, a lawmaker of the party, said.After the November 2022 election, Dahal, chief of the third-largest party in the House, continuously led the government for over one-and-a-half years exploiting the support of both the Congress and the UML, by turn. During this period, the UML backed Dahal two times while the Congress supported him once to form the government.Dahal first became the prime minister with the UML’s support. But the Congress was bent on breaking the UML-Maoist alliance and supported him in the vote of confidence after his swearing-in.After that, Dahal and Deuba started hobnobbing. When Dahal decided to support Congress candidate Ramchandra Paudel in the presidential election, the UML withdrew its support to the Dahal government on February 26, 2023.When Dahal faced the second floor test on March 20, he secured 172 votes in the House.Dahal, during the second trust vote, was supported by the Congress, Rastriya Swatantra Party, Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal (before the party split), Unified Socialist, Janamat Party, Loktantrik Samajbadi Party, Nagarik Unmukti Party, three independent lawmakers and a lawmaker of Rastriya Janamorcha.On March 4, Dahal broke its coalition with the Congress to join hands with the UML. He then went for the floor test for the third time on March 13.In his third floor test, Dahal received 157 votes from the UML, RSP, Janata Samajbadi Party, Unified Socialist, and Nagarik Unmukti Party, in addition to his own party.Meanwhile, Dahal again went for the floor test on May 20, for the fourth time, just two months after his third attempt. This time, he had to seek the parliament’s confidence after a group of seven lawmakers from his coalition partner Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal split the party and formed a new outfit under Ashok Rai’s leadership on May 5.After the party split, JSP-Nepal chair Upendra Yadav withdrew its support to the government. In the subsequent floor test, Dahal garnered 157 votes.Out of 12 political parties in the House of Representatives, along with the first and second largest parties—the Congress and the UML—other 10 parties and five independent lawmakers supported Dahal when he sought a vote of trust for the first time after the 2022 election.In the hung parliament, there are only two scenarios to form the government. Either the Congress and the UML should come together, or one of them should build the majority with the support of other fringe parties to form the government.This time, the Congress and the UML decided to forge a partnership despite the odds. As per the understanding between the two parties, UML chief KP Sharma Oli will lead a ‘national consensus government’ for a year and a half. After that, Sher Bahadur Deuba, the Congress president, will succeed him for the remaining term of the House. \nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that Nepal’s economy, still reeling from subdued domestic demand and post‑pandemic balance sheet repairs, may face an increasingly gloomy and uncertain outlook, mainly due to fragile political stability and cooperatives failure.The global lender, which provides policy advice and financing to its members to foster growth and financial stability, said Nepal’s fragile political stability could disrupt policy continuity and reform implementation. Nepal is set to elect the new prime minister next week. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is almost certain to fail the trust vote. This will be his fifth trust vote in a year and a half. The CPN-UML withdrew its support to the government on July 3 after it ditched its coalition with the CPN (Maoist Centre) and joined hands with the Nepali Congress to form a new government.This is the fourth time in Nepal’s political history that two major parties are forming a government without a powerful opposition, which observers say weakens democracy's effective functioning.On Tuesday, the IMF completed the fourth review under its four‑year extended credit facility, allowing Nepal to withdraw $41.3 million to help the country's economic recovery.This brings total disbursements under the extended credit facility for budget support to $247.7 million.The IMF executive board approved the extended credit facility arrangement for Nepal on January 12, 2022. The approved amount totals $371.6 million, which is 180 percent of Nepal’s special drawing rights quota (SDR) of 282.42 million.“Nepal’s economy continues to face challenges,” said the statement issued by the IMF on Thursday. It said that Nepal’s growth projected at 3 percent in the fiscal year 2023-24 remains below potential due to subdued domestic demand and post‑pandemic balance sheet repairs. The IMF has talked about Nepal’s cooperatives sector for the first time.In the statement, the IMF warned about the intensification of financial sector vulnerabilities, such as a further rise in non-performing loans. In this context, “more failures of cooperative lenders could endanger the banking system's soundness,” the IMF said.According to experts and bankers interviewed by the Post, cooperatives, which the government once embraced as one of the three pillars of the economy, are now threatening the economy.In Nepal, millions of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are heavily involved in cooperatives, and their failure could not only damage the fragile economy, but also harm social harmony, say experts. Cooperatives are involved in sectors ranging from dairy and livestock to tailoring and retail.Recently, thousands of victims of cooperatives fraud have staged protests in various parts of the country, demanding the return of deposits embezzled by cooperative operators. Hundreds of such depositors came to Kathmandu and staged protests. The government recently signed an agreement with them, promising to solve their problems as soon as possible.“The problem in the cooperative sector will shake up the banking sector. But if there is a wise move, the banking sector can absorb the shock,” said Upendra Poudyal, president of the Confederation of Banks and Financial Institutions Nepal. He said that the regulation of cooperatives has already been delayed. “We have seen that cooperatives are being operated for personal gains. A limited number of people took the benefit.” “Now, the central bank should begin with a single threshold. Limit the number and start supervision.” As of mid-March, there are 31,450 cooperatives in Nepal, with 7.38 million members. The deposit mobilisation in cooperatives amounted to Rs478 billion, while credit mobilisation stood at Rs405 billion. They currently employ 94,000 people.In a recent interview, Kashi Raj Dahal, immediate past chairman of the Crisis-ridden Cooperatives Management Committee, a government agency, told the Post that globally, most cooperatives work in productive sectors like food production, dairy, fruits and other agricultural activities. “But in Nepal, around 25,000 cooperatives are involved only in financial activities, mainly collecting deposits and issuing loans. Such cooperatives are now in crisis. Over 15,000 are registered to collect deposits. Even others registered as multi-purpose cooperatives primarily engage in savings and credits. Around 500 cooperatives are currently in trouble.”The Dahal-led government has promised the return of at least Rs500,000 to each depositor by recovering it from the directors' assets. Yet doubts persist about whether depositors will get back their money. Some economists have warned about potential mass protests if the cooperatives issue is not taken seriously.The IMF has also warned that the failure to raise the execution rate of large-scale projects would deprive the economy of much-needed stimulus and weigh on growth. On the pessimistic side, the IMF said that economic activity is expected to increase, reaching 4.9 percent in 2024-25, supported by more robust domestic demand. The statement reads that the cautiously accommodative monetary policy stance, the planned increase in capital expenditures in the 2024-25 budget, additional hydropower generation, and a continued rise in tourist arrivals are expected to boost domestic demand and growth. Inflation is expected to remain within the Nepal Rastra Bank’s (NRB) target ceiling of 5.5 percent.“Nepal has made important strides on its economic reform agenda. Decisive actions in monetary policy, bank regulation and rolling off Covid support policies played a major role in overcoming urgent balance of payments pressure in 2021-22,” said Bo Li, deputy managing director of IMF. “Reserves continue to rise without the need to use distortive import restrictions. Despite revenue shortfalls, fiscal discipline was maintained in 2022-23 and 2023-24. Bank supervision and regulation have improved by rolling out new supervisory information systems. Nepal’s medium-term outlook remains favourable as strategic investments in infrastructure, especially in the energy sector, are expected to support potential growth.”The IMF said that strengthening public investment management would support the needed boost to capital spending. Enhancing fiscal transparency will help contain fiscal risks and strengthen medium-term fiscal sustainability.“As monetary policy transmission is still weak in a context of balance sheet repair, a cautious and data-dependent monetary policy remains appropriate to preserve price and external stability,” the IMF said.  \nAmid an economic slowdown, the banking sector is looking for a slightly loose monetary policy to boost the confidence of the financial and private sectors, including individuals. The banking sector expects favourable working capital guidelines, which will open avenues for the financial industry and traders to increase their economic activities. In this context, the Post’s Krishana Prasain caught up with Upendra Prasad Poudel, chairman of Nabil Bank, to discuss the economy and the banking sector amid Nepal’s ballooning foreign exchange reserves and slowed lending. Excerpts:The monetary policy is due soon. What are the expectations of the banking industry?Our expectations from monetary policy are high as the country’s economy is going through a challenging situation. Some people say the economy is in crisis. But I don't call it a crisis because the external sector, including key economic indicators, is doing well. The country’s economy is looking for a boost—confidence where it will be easy for everyone to work in tandem. Our economic base is small. It will not take a long time for the economy to revive. In that background, we need a loose monetary policy to address everyone's needs.A loose monetary policy aims to stimulate economic activity and reduce unemployment by lowering interest rates and increasing the money supply. Without a loose monetary policy, building the private sector confidence is difficult. Liquidity is sufficient. To increase the credit demand, there is a need to boost consumption. To increase consumption, people need to have enough cash in their hands. That demands government and private sector investments. This depends on both fiscal and monetary policies. For instance, the construction sector is facing trouble, and as a result, there is not much economic activity with the government failing to pay the contractors. When contractors are not getting money, they are not giving it to workers. So the money is not reaching the people. As a result, consumption has remained stagnant. The government is not giving subsidies to agriculture or the insurance sector. We learn that the government needs more money. The private sector no longer trusts the government’s fiscal policy. In contrast, since the banking sector is regulated and disciplined, everyone looks up to monetary policy. Naturally, the private sector has high expectations from the central bank. What kind of policies are needed to revive the economy? As I said, public consumption needs to grow. To boost consumption, there is a need to increase credit. In the past, the banking sector made aggressive lending, but the credit did not go into the real economy or the productive sector. So, the central bank and commercial banks are now worried. Even though credit has seen a growth lately, the impact is not visible. At one level, the money needs to reach everyone's hands. So monetary policy needs to encourage credit flow. There is a slowdown in the banking industry, too. Banks are not able to offer dividends. Positive developments also exist. Interest has been cut, which will reduce capital costs, ultimately increasing output and consumption.Foreign exchange reserves are at a record high. Banks’ lending has yet to improve. What does this show?People are spending less. Reduced spending means that the demand for goods and services has declined. Even though the interest rate has declined, banks struggle to boost credit. As the foreign exchange rate increases, we have the space to increase imports. Banks have liquidity and the capacity to disburse funds. Interest rates are also declining, and the environment is becoming more conducive. But the demand for loans is a must. The confidence in the system must be high for the demand for loans to grow. The International Monetary Fund also indicates that Nepal’s situation may improve in the next fiscal year, depending on the monetary policy. What is sustainable banking? Why are Nepali banks reluctant to follow it?We look at sustainable banking in a futuristic way. We work for days beyond today. We work for tomorrow's generation. We work to make resources available for tomorrow. We must work to make everything sustainable. We have to preserve nature. Banks have gone for short-term profits. That's how we have deviated from sustainability. But our banks still need to go for sustainable practices. The central bank defines the productive sector including energy as the real economy. Investing in those sectors leads to sustainability.Our system ranks banks on the basis of profit, the number of depositors or the volume of loans. In reality, though, to be number one, the parameter should be the impact the bank has on the economy, environment, and society. Knowingly or unknowingly, everyone is talking about sustainable banking. Many banks have started reporting their carbon footprints. Many banks, including Nabil, have started various schemes for agriculture. There are products for women entrepreneurship for inclusive development and migrant workers as well. The banking sector needs to be aware of responsible investment. The central bank has been reinforcing this idea from time to time. How have cooperatives issues affected banks?As the financial system is interlinked, problems in the cooperative sector have impacted the banking sector directly or indirectly. Some cooperative deposits are with banks, and the bank's money has also gone to cooperatives. Not only cooperatives but some credit to loan sharks might have been sourced from banks, too. These are serious issues that need to be tackled prudently. We sense that the problem in the cooperatives sector will shake up the banking sector one day. The banking sector is highly regulated and has the capacity to absorb any shock, though it may not make a profit as before. Regulating cooperatives is difficult now: it’s already too late. The SME sector complains that getting bank loans isn’t easy. What can be done to increase credit flow?We are the custodians of depositors and cannot lend money to anyone easily. We draw a borderline to mitigate possible risk. Lack of financial literacy is still prevailing, and we have been working to create awareness. The financial sector has become transparent, but the private sector hasn’t. The government needs to create an environment that makes businesses transparent. The banks have started taking steps to develop and scale up entrepreneurship. Such initiative needs to be taken by the government, including the local level. The growth in entrepreneurship will stop our youths from going abroad. The government needs to spend heavily on developing entrepreneurship by supporting startups. Nepal has started cross-border digital payment. How has the banking sector started preparation, especially on the operating side?Banks have made a giant leap in terms of digital payment. Certain levels of credit are being approved online. Bank accounts are opened online, and security documents are automatically generated. We have moved ahead in the information and technology systems in the banking sector. However, we are still in the infancy when it comes to the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in the banking sector. To make transactions with India more comprehensive, we need support from Indian regulators, especially in preventing illegal transactions. With proper regulations and support, digital payments will boom. \nThe reconstruction of Achham Durbar, a historical palace in Mangalsen severely damaged by Maoist bombing during the insurgency, nears completion after 16 years.The local people are elated to see the palace being restored to its original shape and style. “The Achham Durbar is an identity of Mangalsen and the entire Achham district,” said Khagendra BK, a local resident. “The locals were anxious as the reconstruction work had commenced six years after the palace was damaged, and the work was delayed under various pretexts.”The historical palace was severely damaged when the Maoist insurgents bombed it on February 16, 2002. In the explosion, a total of 122 people were killed, including the then Chief District Officer Mohan Singh Khatri.In 2008, the government had allocated Rs22.5 million for the reconstruction of the palace, originally built in the style of Kathmandu’s Hanuman Dhoka Durbar. Locals say the reconstruction work was affected by political pressure and negligence of the contractor, among other things. BK said that major political parties repeatedly raised the issue of the palace reconstruction during election campaigns but forgot it afterwards. “The political parties here have made the palace an election agenda. Now, when it appears that the construction is almost complete, they are trying to take credit saying it was possible because of them,” he said. “The palace is almost ready. The remaining work should not be stopped under any pretext.” The palace, also known as Mangalsen Durbar, sits in the middle of the Mangalsen market. “Since the palace was destroyed, the entire market seems incomplete and quiet,” said 80-year-old Kapure Nagarjee, a resident of Mangalsen. “Even though it took years to rebuild, the palace looks just like how it used to. This palace is connected to the history of Achham. It feels like history has come alive rather than just being a reconstructed palace,” he said.The historical palace is being rebuilt under the supervision of the Department of Archaeology. As the project nears completion, discussions have started about its use and ownership. Padam Bahadur Bohara, mayor of Mangalsen Municipality, said now there should be a discussion about who will own it. “Government offices including the district administration office and the police office were housed in the palace when it was destroyed. Separate buildings for these offices are being built now,” said Bohara. “The palace can be used as a museum. But what should be kept in it. All the historical artefacts inside the durbar were destroyed in the attack. It is better to use the palace as an administrative office of Magalsen Municipality.”Chief District Officer of Achham, Shiva Prasad Lamsal, said that his office has been overseeing the construction work and the palace will be ready by the Dashain festival, which falls in the month of October. “The roof of the palace has been covered. So work can continue even when it’s raining,” he said. “The authorities and stakeholders should sit together and formulate operational guidelines for the management and protection of the palace.” Currently, about 90 percent of the reconstruction work is complete.For the reconstruction of the palace, a contract was signed in 2010 with five construction companies namely Rajendra, Saud, Tulchidurga, Badimalika and Kuwar. In the beginning, work was delayed as Meen Bahadur Kuwar was authorised to carry out the work, but other companies left after receiving some payments. Currently, Rajendra and Saud Construction are in charge of the construction. Jaya Bahadur Saud, director of Saud Construction, said the difficulty in sourcing the specific wood needed for the old structure has been causing some delays.Earlier, the palace housed various offices including the district administration office, land revenue office, district court, among others. But at the time of the Maoist attack, only the district administration office was there. In the incident, 122 people including 53 soldiers, 59 policemen, two civil servants including the chief district officer, and eight civilians were killed. The construction of Achham Durbar began 150 years ago during the reign of the local king TikaBhuk Shah of Magalsen and was completed in around 1878 during the reign of his son Dal Bahadur Shah. According to Surat Bahadur Shah, an expert on Achham’s history, the government bought the palace for Rs90,000 from Yogendra Bahadur Shah, the son of the Achham king, in 1972. Yogendra Bahadur's brother, Tapendra Bahadur Shah, who was an army general, facilitated the sale of the palace to the government.The original palace was a three-storey building 20 metres long and 16 metres wide, with 30 rooms. \nPrime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal lost his position on Friday, over one year and six months after his appointment, as he failed to secure a vote of confidence during a floor test in the House of Representatives.Dahal failed to secure the 138 votes required to endorse the trust motion as only 63 lawmakers voted in his favour in the 275-member House of Representatives. A total of 194 lawmakers voted against him, while a member cast a no vote. A total of 258 lawmakers were present in Friday’s meeting of the lower House.The prime minister opted for the floor test in accordance with Article 100(2) of the constitution after the CPN-UML withdrew its support to the government following a deal with the Nepali Congress to form a new coalition, reducing the Dahal-led government to a minority.Speaking at the Parliament while presenting the trust motion earlier in the morning, the prime minister said his party would not weaken the constitution and not allow others to do so.Stating that the constitution provides a month’s time for the prime minister to seek a vote of trust, he said the party under his leadership will consistently defend the constitution.“The Maoist Centre has made a big sacrifice in the course of making this constitution. Therefore, the Maoist does not make it weak and it also does not allow it to be enfeebled,\" said PM Dahal while addressing the House meeting. “This constitution made on the foundation of a decade-long revolt and the subsequent movements of the oppressed classes, regions, genders and communities has been protected taking the support of the people from the streets, and it will be defended in the same manner in the coming days as well.”It was the fifth floor test for the prime minister after being appointed prime minister on December 25, 2022.Dahal had gone for the floor test for the first time on January 10, 2023. He had received 268 votes then. The prime minister won the trust motion for the second time only three months later as he broke ties with the CPN-UML and forged an alliance with the Nepali Congress. He secured the support of 172 lawmakers at the time.He had to seek the vote of confidence for a third time after Congress withdrew its support to the government after Dahal again broke the alliance with Congress and joined hands with the CPN-UML and other parties on March 4. He had received 157 votes then.A split in the Janata Samajbadi Party, Nepal, in May of this year forced Dahal to face the floor again, where he secured the vote of confidence for the fourth time with 157 votes.President Ramchandra Paudel will now make a call for a new government formation. As soon as the prime minister fails the vote, Speaker Devraj Ghimire will inform President Paudel of the results. The UML is planning to claim the formation of a new government with the support of over two-thirds of the lawmakers. As per the understanding between Nepali Congress and UML, UML chair KP Sharma Oli will lead the new ‘national consensus government’ for a year and a half. For the remaining term of the present parliament, Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba will be the prime minister. \nPresident Ramchandra Paudel has entrusted the Pushpa Kamal Dahal government with the responsibility of carrying out its regular duties until a new government is formed.A statement issued by the Office of the President said President Paudel, as per Article 77 (3) of the constitution, has assigned the current government to carry out its tasks until a new government is in place.“The incumbent Cabinet has been entrusted with the responsibility of continuing its operations until a new Cabinet is formed,” read the statement. The President made the decision after the Speaker of the House of Representatives sent a letter to the Office of the President stating that Prime Minister Dahal’s motion was not endorsed by a majority.Prime Minister Dahal lost his position on Friday, over 18 months after his appointment, as he failed to secure a vote of confidence during a floor test in the House of Representatives.Dahal couldn’t secure the 138 votes required to endorse the trust motion as only 63 lawmakers voted in his favour in the 275-member House of Representatives.

Now, it’s up to him to decide when to make the appointment,” said Ramesh Lekhak, Congress chief whip.President Paudel earlier on Friday called on members of the House of Representatives to stake claim for the post of prime minister showing a majority with the support of two or more political parties in the lower house.The Office of the President, in a statement, has called on the House members to present the majority through the support of parties represented in the lower house by Sunday evening.“The President, in accordance with Article 76 (2) of the constitution, calls on House of Representative members to show a majority in order to be appointed as the prime minister of Nepal with the support of two or more political parties of the House of Representatives by 5 pm on Sunday,” the statement reads.The Article 76 (2) states that in cases where no party has a clear majority in the House of Representatives, the President shall appoint as the prime minister a member of the House of Representatives who can command majority with the support of two or more parties represented in the lower house.Prime Minister Puspa Kamal Dahal lost his position on Friday, over 18 months after his appointment, as he failed to secure a vote of confidence during a floor test in the House of Representatives.Dahal couldn’t secure the 138 votes required to endorse the trust motion as only 63 lawmakers voted in his favour in the 275-strong House of Representatives. A total of 194 lawmakers voted against him, while a member cast a no vote. A total of 258 lawmakers were present in Friday’s meeting of the lower House. \nPrime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is all set to go today. After being taken for a ride turn-by-turn by a distant third CPN (Maoist Centre) led by Dahal, the two big parties in Parliament—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—have joined hands to form a coalition government. And with this, Dahal, who remained at or around the power centre for almost a decade even with his party performing poorly in polls, is pushed to the periphery—at least for a while. The overzealous commentaries about Dahal being thrown off the grid of power may, however, be premature. As per the current constitutional provisions, coalition culture is here to stay. And considering how adamant the political parties are in sticking to their morally corrupt politics, no one can tell if the impending Congress-UML coalition stays for the next three months or three years. As Dahal goes today, there does not seem to be much point assessing how well his coalition with the UML fared in just four months of its existence. It takes decades, even centuries, to build a nation. The five-year term of Parliament is the minimum required for a set of leaders to make some impactful decisions for the country. There certainly are provisions for changes in the government, even in the midst of the parliamentary term, but these should be exceptional cases. What we have got, however, is a perpetuity of the coalition culture. It is this perpetuity that has halted the nation-building process for decades now. With the same set of three old men playing the hot potato game around power, nation-building has become a staccato performance at best. Just as one performer comes to the stage and starts his performance, he is pushed to the sidelines in the middle of the act.Pushpa Kamal Dahal will perform the last scene of the four-month act that was his coalition. He will come on stage, search for UML chairperson KP Sharma Oli among the audience, and call him a betrayer. He will then look for the Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba and blame him for being power-hungry. Oli and Deuba will then take the stage by turns and blame Dahal for trying to take them for fools. Such acts have been repeatedly performed, with the same set of plots, performances and actors. There is certainly a new actor on the block, a television presenter who thought he had had enough of shouting out of the small screen. He stepped out of the screen into the field and competed with the old guards whose noses he wanted to break—as his infamous saying went.The moment Rabi Lamichhane came to the spotlight after an impressive electoral showing, the masks he had worn all along started falling off. After a while, he became the fourth old man in the club of politicians who see fault in everyone else besides themselves. Only that Lamichhane was louder, more contemptuous of the media, and as directionless as the other three when it came to envisioning a future for the nation. As Dahal is forced to step down and Oli is about to take the helm, it is worth pondering if this sordid cycle of drama will end anytime soon.  \nThere is a growing public outcry over rampant corruption in Nepal. People believe that corruption is widespread and institutionalised and involves political parties, senior government officials, local elected representatives, business communities and civil societies. New scandals seem to emerge constantly, with the government stepping up efforts in some cases but arresting only a few individuals involved, who are released soon after. Only junior officials or ordinary individuals are charged and made accountable, sparing the key masterminds and those with influence, party leaders, or senior government officials.Given the scale, magnitude and possible involvement of the highest level of political leadership and their patronage in the scandals, the public’s concern is that the institutions established to control corruption have become dysfunctional with the meddling of senior party or government officials or prominent business people. These institutions are primarily headed by individuals with patronage from the political party leadership, who protect the perpetrators manipulating the institution’s functioning. Furthermore, given that we have a united government with continued political negotiations taking place, there may be threats to pull down the government if certain give-and-takes are not met; thus, it is unlikely that any action will be taken against anyone involved. Deputy Prime Minister and senior political leader Narayan Kaji Shrestha recently stated that if the political party members are accused of corruption, the party leadership will complain and threaten the government to pull out their support. If any civil servants are arrested, the protest comes from civil service unions with threats of street-wise demonstrations. Similarly, if those controlling the economy are accused of wrongdoing, they accuse the government of taking steps to destroy the economy. He stated that all political parties, government and business people are wary of punishing their groups of wrongdoers. He questioned whether the government should punish only ordinary people, street vendors, small businessmen, labourers, or poor people if this is the case. He emphasised that it is impossible to have a clean government without real unity and united efforts by all parties to address corruption. Failure in sustainable developmentA massive increase in corruption continues to threaten the country's overall development, including jobs, infrastructure, health, human development, quality of life for every citizen and overall governance. Employment opportunities are less available in the absence of foreign investments and new industries. Lest we forget, some 75,000-80,000 people leave the country every month, seeking employment abroad. The quality of education in government schools has deteriorated significantly, with only 36 percent passing the latest SEE. Around 100,000 students went abroad for studies in 2023-24 and will most likely not return home. Nepal is bound to lose a new generation of skilled and educated workforce. Reputated public hospitals have become dysfunctional due to the non-availability of medicine, non-functional equipment and the absence of qualified medical professionals, who are often frustrated by a lack of prospects and seek employment abroad. Many private hospitals and educational institutions have been established but are beyond the reach of the vast majority.None of the major road projects have been completed on time in recent years. They often double the timeline, overshoot the budget and use substandard work, resulting in substantial economic loss and prolonged inconvenience and suffering to citizens due to bad road conditions, dust pollution and long travel times. Government offices providing basic services, such as the issuance of driving licenses and passports, are notorious for delayed services.Major scandalsSeveral major scandals that have been in the limelight in the country include gold smuggling, Bhutanese refugee scams, land properties surrounding the PM Office, the Ncell/Axiata sale case, OMNI-Covid-related purchases, the Giribandu Tea Estate case, Cooperative scandals and many more involving hundreds of millions of dollars. The main concern is that the real culprits are walking free, as they are part of the political leadership or individuals with solid party connections. As The Kathmandu Post put it in its recent editorial, “Rotten to the Roots”, indicating high local level corruption and “representatives have copied the ways of their federal leaders”. It is reported that out of 28,000 cases filed by the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA), half of the cases were at the local units in one year. Several such officials were recently reportedly suspended, and thus the local institutions cannot function, potentially threatening the whole process of devolution of power from the centre. Whether local units seriously lack good governance and fiscal transparency also needs to be verified and acted upon.Partnership against corruptionIt is gratifying that Nepal enjoys good friendship and cooperation with many countries, multilateral organisations and the UN, which have been keenly supporting Nepal’s sustainable development, peace processes and democratic transformation. Twenty-five years into the democratic process, there have been significant achievements and friends of Nepal should be proud of their partnerships and cooperation. Nepal is very fortunate that around 26 percent of the annual government budget is supported by development partners. Nepal is at a turning point, with its citizens increasingly concerned about intuitional corruption and the cartel system. In the absence of serious political commitments and weakness in government institutions, the situation risks further deterioration. This situation goes against the people’s aspirations for the overall sustainable development of Nepal, with a threat to security, stability and hard-earned democracy, devolution of power to the local level and failure to achieve the country’s graduation from LDC status. In 2014, major development partners and the UN joined together to remind the Nepali government of their concern regarding rising corruption. Leakage in aid leads to a trust deficit among donors, who continue to develop their strategies and find their way of delivering aid at the cost of the overall impact of development support. Nepal has ratified the 2011 UN Convention Against Corruption, so the government should take all measures to fight corruption. The current situation strongly requires development partners and multilateral institutions, including the UN, to continue to voice their concerns about the institutionalisation of corruption and closely engage with the government in supporting anti-corruption measures on multiple fronts. The outcomes of these efforts will have significant impacts, giving rise to greater values in development aid and across different sectors. Way forward Nepal should ensure that its citizens trust its intentions regarding good governance processes, and all known scandals must be transparently resolved. All governance institutions, such as the CIAA, should be reviewed to make them more effective and fully accountable. Every government public service should be improved through digitisation and targeted timelines, including, for example, the delivery of all pending driving licenses. The development partners must raise concerns about corruption and support the government in strengthening its accountability and transparency process with a robust digital system and other technical assistance. The government should occasionally provide exclusive briefings to the public, media and development partners on the measures it is taking to control corruption.  \nFatal animal attractions between wild and domesticated species threaten both wildlife and herders in remote areas, highlighting the need for cohabitation solutions to protect endangered species and support Indigenous peoples' livelihoods.\nPM Modi's hug with Putin drew criticism, as India prioritizes military-industrial complex, facilitating return of Indian soldiers from Russia's Ukraine invasion, while Nepal struggles to repatriate its citizens.\nPresident Biden faces increasing calls from Democrats to abandon his re-election bid amid concerns over recent stumbles and low approval ratings, but remains adamant about running and recently attended a rally in Detroit.\nPyakuryal, a political analyst and academic, discusses Nepal's political instability, narratives, patriarchy, and future trends in Nepali politics.\nArvind Kejriwal, Delhi CM, granted interim bail in graft case but remains in jail due to another arrest.\nForeign Secretary Sewa Lamsal attended the Second BIMSTEC Foreign Ministers’ Retreat being held in New Delhi on Thursday.During the retreat session, Lamsal reaffirmed Nepal’s unwavering commitments to carry forward BIMSTEC process and stressed on enhanced collaborative efforts among member states to realise shared objectives of sustained peace, stability, and prosperity in the Bay of Bengal region. “She further emphasised that Nepal will continue pursuing a ‘whole of the region’ approach to harness resources for common benefits, strengthen institution-building processes, and transform BIMSTEC into an effective, results-oriented regional forum,” the Embassy of Nepal in New Delhi said.The foreign secretary also highlighted the importance of leveraging synergies of South Asia and South-East Asia to ensure tangible benefits to the people of the region and addressing pressing challenges including climate change, health-related pandemics, natural disasters and transnational organised crimes, reads the press release issued by the embassy.Lamsal also called on Indian Minister for External Affairs S Jaishankar and Hasan Mahmud, foreign minister of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh, separately.

Some have made clear Kyiv can use them to strike targets deep inside Russia while the United States has taken a narrower approach, allowing its weapons to be used only just inside Russia’s border against targets supporting Russian military operations in Ukraine.Biden told the press conference the United States had allowed Zelenskiy to use American weapons in a limited way within Russia’s borders.Biden said he and US military and intelligence officials were making decisions on “a day-to-day basis on how far they should go in. That’s a logical thing to do.’The United States and its allies have used this week's summit to try to project unity in the face of what they see as a rising threat to Europe from Russia and China.However, NATO member Hungary said ahead of a meeting of NATO members with partners from the so-called Indo-Pacific Four - Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea - that it does not want NATO to become an “anti-China” bloc, and will not support it doing so.Hungary’s Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto also told Hungarian state television that Ukraine’s admission to the military alliance would weaken unity in the group.Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban irked other NATO members with surprise visits to Kyiv, Moscow and Beijing in the past two weeks on a self-styled “peace mission”. He and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump will meet on Thursday at the latter’s Florida home, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.Orban’s meeting in Moscow with Russian President Vladimir Putin in particular angered some fellow NATO allies, who said the trip handed legitimacy to Putin’s claims to Ukrainian territory seized since Russia’s 2022 invasion.Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, told a public forum he would not speculate on whether Orban’s trip to Moscow was coordinated with Trump, Biden’s rival in the November US election, but said the Ukrainians had grave misgivings about any effort to negotiate a peace deal without them.“So whatever adventurism is being undertaken without Ukraine’s consent or support is not something that’s consistent with our policy, the foreign policy of the United States,” he said.ANGRY WORDS FROM CHINAWednesday’s NATO declaration included sharp words about China, calling it “a decisive enabler” of Russia’s war in Ukraine, and said Beijing continues to pose systemic challenges to Europe and to security.China’s Foreign Ministry said the declaration was biased and “sowing discord” and its mission to the European Union described it as being “full of Cold War mentality and belligerent rhetoric, and China-related content full of provocations, lies, incitement and smears.”At the news conference, Stoltenberg recalled language in the declaration by saying that “China cannot continue to fuel the largest military conflict in Europe without this impacting Beijing's interests and reputation.”China has repeatedly lashed out at NATO criticisms and has warned against its expansion into the Indo-Pacific.Japan, South Korea, New Zealand and Australia have forged stronger ties with NATO amid rising concerns over China’s pressure on rival claimants in disputed waters in the region and on democratic Taiwan, the global hub of cutting-edge chip production, which Beijing claims as its own. \nThe weather today will be generally to mostly cloudy throughout the country.Koshi, Madhesh, Bagmai, Gandaki and Lumbini provinces are expected to experience heavy to very heavy rainfall at a few places heavy rainfall has also been forecast at one or two places in Karnali and Sudurpaschim provinces.Light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is likely to occur across the country.The weather is likely to remain the same until later tonight.Heavy rainfall may continue in Koshi, Madhesh and Gandaki provinces while light rainfall is likely to occur in some places of Bagmati province.Dipayal recorded a maximum temperature of 35.7 degrees Celsius on Thursday while Jomsom had a minimum temperature of 15.5 degrees Celsius. \nImports from China to Nepal rose more sharply than expected in the first eleven months of the current fiscal year ending mid-June, while imports from India continued to tumble.According to the Trade and Export Promotion Center, the national trade promotion body, Nepal’s imports from China increased by 34.8 percent in the review period. In comparison, imports from India fell by 3.1 percent.Experts attributed ballooning imports from China to a sharp rise in the entry of electric vehicles (EVs). Likewise, a fall in imports from India has been attributed to the export curbs on food by the southern neighbour. In terms of value, imports from China increased by Rs70.44 billion to Rs272.81 billion in the review period.Import from India, however, dropped by Rs29.53 billion to Rs908.30 billion in the period.Due to the drop in imports from India, Nepal’s total imports declined 1.8 percent to Rs1.45 trillion in the first eleven months of the current fiscal year, which ended mid-June 2024.An official of the National Statistics Office says for a consumption-driven economy, falling imports are a worrisome sign. This suggests people are spending less on services and consumption while exports are stagnant.Rabindra Duwadi, the spokesperson at the Trade and Export Promotion Center, said imports from the north were driven by a massive influx of EVs, smartphones, and readymade garments.Besides, exports of iron, chemical fertiliser, apples and readymade garments too rose significantly. Traders said that China fulfils 80 percent of Nepal's readymade garment needs. The country imported readymade garments worth Rs33.67 billion in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year.In the same vein, Nepal imported 7,931 EVs worth Rs21.83 billion from China in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, up from 1,269 EVs worth Rs3.75 billion in the same period last fiscal year.Similarly, the country imported 1.23 million units of smartphones worth Rs17.27 billion from China in the review period. During the time, Nepal imported 99,965 tonnes of chemical fertiliser worth Rs8.69 billion from China.In the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, the country imported 65,827 tonnes of apples worth Rs6.98 billion from China, compared to 50,153 tonnes worth Rs4.73 billion in the same period last fiscal year.Duwadi said India’s share of Nepal’s total imports is 65.5 percent, while China contributes 18.8 percent. Traders say Nepal’s trade with India is vast, but it is steadily shifting to China. “One key reason for import growth from China is EVs,” said Rajan Sharma, a trade expert. “Chinese EVs are comparatively cheaper and perform better compared to Indian ones.” According to market observers, that’s why there has been an abrupt switch from India’s Tata Nexon EV to Chinese BYD.Sharma said readymade garments imported from China are cheaper compared to Indian readymade garments, including branded ones, which makes them popular among Nepali customers. “At the same time, India-made branded clothing items are expensive.”The Chinese Shein clothing brand has quickly gained popularity in Nepal due to its trendy clothes and reasonable prices.Trade experts say that due to the open border, there has been a massive rise in informal trade from India in recent years. Smuggling has thrived after India imposed a ban on foods.According to a research report titled, ‘Dynamics of informal cross-border trade in agricultural products between Nepal and India,’ prepared by South Asia Watch on Trade, Economics and Environment, only 40 percent of rice is imported from India through formal channels.India’s share in Nepal’s imports in formal trade is 60 percent, but the share of informal trade is likely to be higher.The research has pointed out that informal trade has thrived after the imposition of a 9 percent agriculture reform fee and a 2.5 percent advanced income tax, resulting in a total duty of 11.5 percent on rice imports.The paper said that India’s ban on rice and other agricultural exports has led to massive smuggling of food through the 1,800 km porous border between Nepal and India.Nepal is dependent on onions imported from India. When the Indian government imposed a ban on onion exports from December 2023 to May 2024, the product was readily available in the vegetable market and grocery stores, which indicated that a massive quantity of onions came through informal trade channels.The government did not take a single step to control the illegal trade or negotiate with the Indian government to ease the repeated bans on export of various agricultural goods. Nepal has thus lost out on huge import revenue as goods are coming to Nepal through illegal channels and are easily available in the market.Paras Kharel, executive director of the South Asia Watch on Trade, Economics and Environment, said overall imports have not been able to rebound in two fiscal years, reflecting the country’s economic slowdown. However, the rise in EV imports contributed to the sudden rise in imports from China.“Imports from Tatopani and Rasuwa customs rose by twice as much,” Kharel said. This shows that imports from China, which were halted after the Covid pandemic, are not gradually improving but are ballooning.According to the Department of Customs, the worth of imports from Tatopani customs increased to Rs37.16 billion in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, compared to Rs11.79 billion in the same period last fiscal year.Similarly, the worth of imports from Rasuwa customs on the northern border increased to Rs55.45 billion in the review period, up from Rs27.25 billion in the same period last fiscal year. \nThe National Human Rights Commission has said that the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act must include war crimes and crimes against humanity as serious violations of human rights while also ensuring justice to former Maoist child soldiers.The constitutional human rights watchdog made its position public as the three major parties worked to finalise the amendment bill to the Act under consideration in a parliamentary committee. Neither the existing Act nor the amendment bill includes war crimes, crimes against humanity and the issues of child combatants. In its report “The National Human Rights Commission and Transitional Justice”, the commission has said that together with murder, enforced disappearance, abduction or disappearances after the kidnapping, torture, rape or other sexual violence, war crimes and crimes against humanity should also be classified as non-amnestiable crimes.The 150-page report the commission is set to unveil on Monday includes its position on the long-pending transitional justice process while also documenting the efforts it made to deliver justice to the war-era victims of human rights violations. Since its establishment in 2002, the commission has investigated 1,073 cases related to the 1996-2006 insurgency and recommended actions against 222 including former Home Secretary and chief of Nepal Police.Following successive governments’ reluctance to follow its recommendations, the commission made public the list of perpetrators in October 2020 and January 2024.The leaders in negotiation are still struggling to finalise whether to list murder as a serious violation of human rights. Despite long negotiations, they have yet to sort out issues of minor Maoist soldiers and sentence reduction. They are also divided on whether victims who refuse to reconcile should be allowed to take their cases to court.The commission’s report says killing any unarmed individual, regardless of their involvement in the conflict, or those not directly involved in the fight, is a serious violation of human rights. There cannot be amnesty for serious violations of human rights, including war crimes and crimes against humanity. Amnesty for other human rights violations is possible only with the written consent of the victims, according to the commission.“Those who refuse pardon should be allowed to seek legal remedy as per the existing laws,” reads the report. “The truth and Reconciliation Commission must delve into the cases of the victims who lost their lives or got injured in landmines planted during the insurgency even after the peace process began.” Issues of child Maoist combatants must be addressed through the law to ensure they get justice, according to the commission.The use of minors in armed conflict is a war crime as per international law. The ruling Maoist Centre, therefore, does not want to include this issue in the law.During the verification process for army integration conducted by UNMIN in 2007, thousands of Maoist fighters had been disqualified for being minors. Among the 4,008 combatants who did not qualify for integration, 2,973 were verified as minors, while the remaining 1,035 had joined the Maoist ‘People’s Liberation Army’ after the first ceasefire of May 26, 2006—six months before the signing of the peace deal. The government had provided between Rs500,000 and Rs800,000 each to the combatants who chose voluntary retirement. However, those who were disqualified didn’t get any substantial support, except for a few thousand rupees from the United Nations.A group of former child soldiers led by Lenin Bista have filed a writ petition at the Supreme Court demanding the prosecution of the then Maoist supreme commander Pushpa Kamal Dahal, now the country’s prime minister, and the then ‘people’s government’ chief Baburam Bhattarai, who also is a former prime minister. The final hearing for the petition has been slated for September.Unlike in other issues, the commission has stood with the political parties on reduced sentencing. “The jail term of convicts who meet the criteria [perpetrators cooperating in the investigation process], can be reduced to a minimum of 25 percent as per existing laws,” reads the report. “The criteria for reduced sentencing can be defined in the law.” Surya Dhungel, a commissioner, said their position is based on international practice where reduced sentencing is common in transitional justice process.The commission has also reiterated that it will send its representative to the panel formed to recommend office bearers in the two transitional justice mechanisms only if there is a commitment from the parties concerned to amend the Act. “We are firm in our decision. Commitment from top political leadership is a must for the commission to send its representative to the recommendation committee,” said Dhungel. \nIn the early 1980s, Nepal’s firebrand communist leader, Mohan Bikram Singh, split from his comrade Nirmal Lama to establish a radical political alternative. Lama and Singh had earlier revolted from the Communist Party of Nepal to establish their own faction after the party’s fourth convention in 1974. Among Singh’s trusted leaders were Mohan Baidya, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, CP Gajurel and Dev Gurung. But Singh was forced to spend most of the following years politically exiled in India. As a result, Baidya effectively captured the party, renaming it the Communist Party of Nepal (CPN), “Mashal,” pronounced slightly different from Lama’s CPN “Masal.” However, Baidya and many senior party leaders faced self-imposed demotion after the party suffered a strategic setback in the now infamous ‘Sector Scandal’. Baidya was forced to nominate Dahal as the party leader in 1989, a position Dahal has held for three and a half decades.During the first two decades of his leadership, Dahal reigned supreme, as his party led the country into a decade-long violent political conflict that claimed, by some estimates, over 16,000 lives. Despite substantial economic and political costs, the conflict accelerated Nepal’s transition from a semi-feudal society with an exclusive political system into a more inclusive and secular republic. To that end, the Dahal-led Maoist party received due recognition through a popular mandate of the 2008 first Constituent Assembly elections. But Dahal’s unnecessary distrust of Nepal’s more established political parties, which had played a considerable role in bringing his party back into the political mainstream, made him commit blunders and unseated him from a comfortable majority government. His suspicion against fellow comrades who questioned his leadership style and decisions led to multiple splintering of the Maoist party. An insecure leaderDespite leading the country in and out of a transformative political conflict and becoming one of the key signatories of the new constitution, Dahal has remained an insecure leader who takes every opportunity to remind the Nepali people and the world about his “revolutionary contributions”. Possibly, this deep-seated insecurity emerges from the fact that he is neither seen as an intellectually gifted politician like his fellow comrade Baburam Bhattarai, who is known as an ideologue of the Maoist conflict or as a leader with integrity and simplicity like that of his political gurus Singh and Baidya. The thought of losing the political legacy of the ‘People’s War’ despite clinging onto the leadership of the party must constantly haunt the Maoist supremo.Dahal’s insecurity and political hypocrisy were also palpable in the way he derided the Madhesh Movement, which also raised the agendas of federalism and inclusion. Instead of considering them allies, Dahal ordered his party cadres to attack the Madheshi party leaders and their cadres. A large part of the political onus of escalating the tensions leading to the unfortunate Gaur massacre in 2007 will always rest on Dahal. Over the past decade and a half, Dahal has repeatedly failed to display the leadership he is ironically fond of discussing. Despite mobilising thousands of Tharu youths during the conflict, he failed to support their genuine claims on provincial boundaries during the federal structuring. And despite claims of his ‘one-sided love’ for Madhesh, he remained silent as more than 50 Madhesi protesters were indiscriminately killed by the security forces in 2015. Unreliable coalition partnerThere was a time when Dahal led a party that had shaken the country’s political core. Less than two decades later, he now leads a party that has mostly eroded its political base and only relies on a stronger coalition partner to remain relevant. But has Dahal even proved to be a reliable coalition partner? Let’s take a closer look. After Baidya split the party in 2012, the CPN-Maoist was reduced to the third position in the second Constituent Assembly elections, a significant loss from its commanding majority in the first CA. In the following two years, Dahal’s party was not only kept out of power but also forced to endorse a constitution that the Nepali Congress and rival communist party CPN-UML tabled. Having lost the capacity to dictate the political course, Dahal resorted to coalition politics. When the opportunity came, he supported UML’s Khadga Prasad Oli to cobble up a coalition government in October 2015. However, when the Nepali Congress offered him to lead a new coalition, he abandoned Oli and became Prime Minister in 2016. With the 2017 elections on the horizon, Dahal knew his party would not be able to compete with the larger parties that had successfully led the constitution drafting. With some active external mediation, Dahal persuaded Oli for an electoral alliance and even agreed to an eventual unification of the communist forces. When the left unity won a landslide victory, Dahal was convinced that Oli would honour the agreement to hand over power to him mid-way through the four-year period. When Oli refused, he split the united CPN in 2020, convincing several disgruntled leaders like Madhav Nepal to abandon the party and join a coalition with the Nepali Congress. The new coalition also offered Dahal and his party a comfortable division of electoral seats in the 2022 local, provincial and federal elections. But soon after the elections were over, Dahal bargained for power with both Deuba and Oli. Despite having won only 32 seats in the federal parliament with only 11 percent popular vote, Dahal managed to become Nepal’s 33rd Prime Minister in December 2022.Impending downfallIn 2014, political analyst CK Lal had told me that Dahal’s political opportunism would make him relevant in Nepali politics for at least another decade. The Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML took exactly a decade to realise that Dahal had been cashing in on Nepal’s fractured politics. This week, the two parties agreed that Nepal’s long-term political stability requires an introspection into the present electoral system, which allows electorally less popular outfits to dictate the course of national politics. So, not only have the two large parties decided to pull the plug on the Dahal government, but they also agreed to form an independent commission to study and propose amendments to the current electoral provision.While there is little disagreement that the current electoral system paved the way for more representation of the hitherto marginalised sections, the opportunity to correct inefficacies like expensive election campaigning and manipulation of the proportional candidacy lists by the parties must not be dismissed either. There are also serious doubts about the intention of the two parties to strike a deal at a time when the Nepal Police and the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority are investigating some high-profile corruption cases. It is up to the two parties to vindicate their intent by ensuring that the new political course does not interfere in these investigations. And even if the two parties agree to amend the constitutional provisions regarding elections, they will need to gather a national consensus or at least a two-thirds majority. Whatever happens in the next few weeks and months, it is evidently clear Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s eventual political downfall is on the horizon. \nIn 2019-20, Nepal imported 236 units of passenger electric vehicles (EVs) from China worth some Rs674 million. In the past five years, imports of EVs from China jumped 35 times, suggesting EV adoption in Nepal is now outpacing that of conventional combustion vehicles which use engines that burn fossil fuels, such as petrol or diesel. The EVs have overtaken conventional combustion vehicles.The imports of fossil fuel-consuming passenger vehicles were 10,310 units worth Rs9.24 billion in 2019-20. After four years, in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, imports of conventional combustion vehicles were down to 3,537 units worth Rs4.21 billionHowever, overall vehicle imports have jumped from Rs65.02 billion in 2019-20 to Rs80 billion in the first 11 months of 2023-24.According to the Department of Customs, Nepal imported 11,466 units of EVs worth Rs29 billion in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, or by mid-June. The imports were 3,870 units worth Rs11.23 billion in the same period last fiscal year. Of the total EV imports, a third came from China. Customs data show that Nepal imported 7,931 units of EVs from China, accounting for 69 percent of the total EV imports in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year. This translates to Rs21 billion in value.After China, the majority of EVs were imported from India. In the review period, imports from India amounted to Rs6 billion, or 3,277 units. Until the last fiscal year, India was Nepal’s top EV supplier.The data show that Nepal imported 2,205 EVs worth Rs5.94 billion from India in the last fiscal year. In the same period, imports from China were 1,269 units worth Rs3.75 billion.Nepal’s imports of EVs jumped sharply by 158.23 percent in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year. Importers say BYD, a Chinese multinational, has taken over the Nepali market. The government collected revenue of Rs13.06 billion from the import of EVs in the review period.Akash Golchha, senior vice president of the Nepal Automobile Dealers Association, said the ongoing economic slowdown has not stopped Nepalis from buying EVs. However, petrol or diesel-run vehicle sales could have been better.EV sales and orders saw a dramatic surge before the budget was announced on May 28. Cimex Inc Pvt Ltd, the authorised distributor of BYD Auto Industry Co Ltd in Nepal, said it had achieved a milestone by delivering 50 cutting-edge BYD EVs in a single day on May 18. According to the company, all 50 units were sold from its service centre at Guheshwari, Kathmandu.According to Cimex, the company imported 4,000 EVs in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year. The import of Chinese EVs is high due to their larger production compared to India, said the company, which is among the top EV brands in Nepal.BYD’s Atto and Dolphin are the most preferred models among Nepali customers. With the recent hike in excise and customs duties, the company said the new price list of BYDs will be unveiled soon.“There was fear among buyers that the government may raise duty on EVs in the budget. As a result, the demand surged dramatically,” said Golchha. “The high import increased the stock of EVs.”Automobile dealers said that the government hiked the duty on EVs by 10 percent in the budget for the coming fiscal year 2024-25, which, however, may not impact the sales.Golchha said the government did not make drastic changes in the import duty of EVs in the budget, which may help EV sales boom in the coming days. “The EV demand will grow at a faster pace.”Auto dealers say the import boost for EVs is mainly due to banks’ easy financing. Banks lend up to 90 percent of the vehicle’s cost.Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun, in the annual budget for the upcoming fiscal year, revised the customs and excise duty rates on the import of EVs. The customs duty on EVs of up to 50 kW has been increased to 15 percent from 10 percent, while a 5 percent excise duty has been imposed on them.Likewise, the government increased the customs and excise duties on EVs of 50-100 kW by 5 percent. As per the revised tariffs, the customs duty has been increased to 20 percent from 15 percent, while the excise duty has been increased to 15 percent from 10 percent.The customs duty on 100-200 kW has been raised to 30 percent from 20 percent. Similarly, those in categories 200-300 kW and more than 300 KW will be subject to customs duty of 60 percent and 80 percent, respectively. In these vehicles, the indirect tax has been raised by 20 percent each.According to EV traders, the market is flooded with various EV models, features, and looks, and customers have options to select according to their needs. They said that EVs ranging from Rs4 million to Rs5.5 million have a large customer base, while high-priced EVs are also seeing good sales.EV traders said that despite the market slowdown, the EV sector has not been affected.“One interesting emerging trend is that people who already own conventional combustion vehicles are also buying EVs,” said Golchha. \nOn May 28, presenting the financial plan for the upcoming fiscal year, Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun said all the 77 districts of the country are now connected by the national road network.But the ground reality is different.Without a bridge over the Karnali river at Chuwa Khola of Kharpunath rural municipality, Simkot, the district headquarters of Humla, remains to be connected to the national road network. Villagers in the northwestern corner of Nepal bordering Tibet in China where the Humla Karnali crosses face hardships in the absence of one bridge.Though the track was opened to Simkot in mid-April, the construction of the bridge has yet to be completed. As a result, a 12 km section still needs to be completed to connect the district headquarters.Now, vehicles carrying goods along the Karnali Corridor can only reach Kharpu. From there, the goods have to be transported by helicopters and carried over the river using cables, resulting in additional costs. This method, however, is possible only when the water level is low. Due to the lack of a bridge, around ten vehicles bought for government offices and passenger service via Surkhet were taken across the river using ropes and a bulldozer. The cars are now operating on the Simkot side.In 2007-08, the government announced in the annual budget that it would connect Simkot to the national road network. However, even after a decade and a half, Simkot is not connected to the national road network.In September 2021, the joint venture of Swachchhanda, Mount, and Pumori was awarded the Rs110 million contract for the bridge. The construction companies were issued Rs11 million in advance, and the project completion deadline was fixed in March this year.However, the company did not start the construction work for a long time, and around a year ago, it was necessary to change the design.“The joint venture company was responsible for constructing a 55-metre-long motorable truss bridge. But when the contractor started to dig the foundation, a hot water spring was found,” said Bel Bahadur Nepali, chief of the Simikot-Hilsa Road Construction Project. “The assessment showed that the bridge will not be durable if it is constructed on the existing design. So, we made the new design, which got approved two weeks ago. We will start the bridge construction work in July.”Nepali said that with the change in design, the contractor has been given a new deadline to complete the project: August 2025.Binod Kumar Pokharel, chief district officer, said the locals have demanded a Bailey or portable bridge as it may take time to complete the project. “Due to the lack of a bridge, the travellers are facing hassles. The passenger and goods transport charges too are high.”Pokharel said the river's flow is high throughout the year, so vehicles must be towed across the river with the help of an earthmover to Simkot. “To solve the problem, the locals have demanded a Bailey bridge. We are assessing the need.”Until last year, vehicles were operated from Khulalu of Kalikot towards Mugu-Bajura-Sillisalla of Humla. Nepali said that the 39 km road track was opened this year. This year, a 39-kilometre stretch was added. The project opened 8 km of the total track, and the Nepal Army did the work on the remaining 9 km section. The road from Khulalu of Kalikot to the Chinese border is 268 km long. Of this, 95 km south of Simkot is served by transportation. However, as the vehicle flow is breached by the lack of a bridge, passengers from Simkot to Khapunath rural municipality must change the vehicle by crossing suspension bridges on foot.Dan Bahadur Shahi, a senior citizen, said since there is no bridge, vehicles are charging higher fares. Jeeps run on the 12km Simkot-Kharpu stretch. The vehicle operators charge Rs700 to Rs1,000 per person as fare for a special arrangement called “reserve”. In similar fashion, the jeep operated from Kharpu via Sillisalli to Surkhet charges Rs7,000 per person, he said.“We are compelled to change the vehicle as there is no bridge. While crossing the river using the suspension bridge, we need to pay wages to a porter,” Shahi said. “If there were a bridge, we would be able to reach Surkhet by a single vehicle, and the fare would be less.”The price of daily consumable goods in Simkot is sky high, too. “No goods-carriers operate here; small jeeps are permitted to carry passengers only. This means we have to transport goods using porters so the prices refuse to come down,” said Bhim Bahadur Rokaya, a trader at Simkot.“There is no chance of prices falling unless a bridge is constructed across the Kharpu river, allowing for goods to be ferried by trucks,” Rokaya said.Pokharel said that because route permits are issued only from Khulalu of Kalikot to Sillisalli, fares are not fixed. “We have directed the Transport Management Office, Jumla, to manage the route permit and fare. The decision will be taken soon by a meeting of the transportation management committee.” \n\n\nSri Lanka’s rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences make it one of the world’s best holiday destinations. The most common sight across the island nation is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure—a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use. Despite being cash-strapped and plunging into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back, thanks to the growing number of tourists. We spent five days in the island country two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Following the trip spanning over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites, the Post presents a travel guide to Sri Lanka. \nDia Yonzon (she/her) is a writer and researcher. She runs The Melung Stories, a platform dedicated to amplifying the literary and artistic expressions of queer and indigenous communities. Yonzon is also affiliated with the Writing Center at the Open Institute of Social Science.In this conversation with the Post’s Rishika Dhakal, Yonzon talks about queer literature, her work at UN Women Nepal, and the books that have influenced her.How has your background in law and arts influenced your approach to advocacy and activism at UN Women Nepal?I worked at the UN Women Nepal for three years. My background in law had a direct influence on my work. However, I never wanted to become a practising lawyer; I just wanted to understand the philosophy of law. While studying law, I gravitated towards the field of human rights.Currently, I am involved in creating art and literature. I realised that when we need to say something in society, more than logistics and data, what touches people’s hearts is art. It is because art shapes us in subtle ways, knowingly or unknowingly.Reading feminist literature has also shaped my activism. So, everything I do has been shaped by the books I read. For example, many people dismiss ‘Pride and Prejudice’ as cheap literature. But once you read the book, you will find that Jane Austen provided satirical commentary on the era in which she was born.Even today, we tend to dismiss literature. Art and literature provide a subtle glimpse of the contemporary world.The first book that made a significant impact on you and why?I mostly write about how time and space affect love. As a child, I remember reading ‘The Time Traveller’s Wife’, the first book I purchased with pocket money.And now that I think about it, the book significantly influenced me because I am a sucker for romance. The story centres on a timeless love that transcends specific moments and places. This one component resonated with me.But as my writing grew, I realised it didn’t necessarily have to be about sci-fi. I write about general things, such as how people express love. I developed that by reading ‘The Time Traveller’s Wife’.In your experience, how important is queer literature for the representation and empowerment of queer individuals?While growing up, I didn’t see much mainstream literature that had queer representation. This made me feel like I was some sort of outcast. And it wasn’t just me who felt this way; others did, too. You want to feel you are being represented. During my childhood, there was only one mainstream memoir about a gay person that I remember. Nepali literature should be more diverse. As it will allow young people from such communities to feel like they are being represented. The greater the presence of queer literature, the more normalised it will become.Currently, the representation of queer people is disheartening, often depicting their lives as solely filled with suffering. By discussing the various dimensions of queer life, including joy and sadness, we can normalise these experiences. This helps non-queer allies to relate and understand better.One of my major concerns is that we only have access to popular media, which limits our understanding of contemporary society in the past. For queer people, this is especially troubling because there are no reference points to learn about their experiences and situations back then.Decades ago, queerness was vilified. Films like ‘Chandigarh Kare Aashiqui’, reflect minor narrative shifts in our society, even if they are misguided portrayals of the experiences of queer people.Compared to the past, many people today are discussing queerness, indicating a significant societal shift. This is why it is crucial to write more queer stories now. From a documentary and archival perspective, these stories will be invaluable for understanding the experiences of queer people in the future.As someone who is into fiction, how do you think it can contribute to understanding social issues?Fiction reflects contemporary society and its conversations, ultimately allowing us to address various prevalent issues. In fiction, if you’re a man reading a novel with a female protagonist, you can immerse yourself in the protagonist’s experience. Because fiction is a story, it isn’t necessarily preachy. It doesn’t order people to do this or that. Instead, it builds a world and invites people to explore it. No subject is one-dimensional, so it allows you to explore everything. Speculative fiction lets us see what might happen if we continue on a certain path.By capturing all the small nuances of society in the story, we can amplify and highlight issues that have not received the attention they deserve.What books would you recommend to non-queer allies who want to better understand and support queer communities?Many smaller publications help in aiding one's understanding of queerness. Recently, we conducted a 10-day residency titled ‘A Room of One’s Own’. The UN, Katha Satha, and the Open Institute supported the residency. At the end of it, we published a book of the same title. One can follow magazines like ‘Queerbad’ by the Queer Muslim Project (TQMP), which features stories written by queer writers from South Asia. Similarly, the ‘A Room of One’s Own: Queer Writer’s Residency’ publication can also be followed. Additionally, small independent zines such as ‘A Song of Revolution’ from Nepal should be considered.For more accessible reads, I recommend Niranjan Kunwar’s ‘Between Queens and the Cities’ and ‘Beyond the Gender Binary’ by Alok Vaid-Menon. Ocean Vuong's ‘On Earth, We’re Briefly Gorgeous’ is also an excellent work of fiction that provides insight into queer experiences.Can you share about the Melung stories writing workshop? How do these workshops contribute to the queer and indigenous literary community?Melung Stories is a storytelling platform. They document and archive stories of queer people. Writing is not seen as a lucrative job. Even if one chooses to be a writer, they need a community. The community I speak of includes editors, readers, and publishers who will support you. Plus, there is no certainty that it will pay you. In that context, many people who belong to indigenous or marginalised communities avoid writing and instead take up stable jobs that pay well. So, who ends up writing? Folks who already have resources, have generational wealth or can make time for themselves. In our workshop, we target queer and indigenous people. We want to give them resources, time, space, guidance, and a certain agency. There are lots of people who want to share their stories but don’t have the time or the space to do so. So, in Melung stories, we give them time and space. And their stories get recorded. How do you envision the future of queer literature and representation in Nepal?When discussing art and literature, we assume they are void of societal issues. This is because the language we use to discuss them is sophisticated. However, art and literature are not created in a vacuum. They feed off of society and reflect the society we live in. Nepal and South Asia need more diverse voices to tell authentic and meaningful queer stories. Queer literature shouldn’t be limited to biographies and memoirs; it can include fiction, biography, or sci-fi to reach a broader audience. Queer books shouldn’t be treated as rare treasures but should be made widely accessible.Diya Yonzon’s book recommendationsThe God of Small ThingsAuthor: Arundhati RoyPublisher: Random HouseYear: 1997The book tells the story of two fraternal twins.

GB Rai, who is at large, is believed to have fled the country.In its terms of reference (ToR), the committee has divided the cooperatives it has to investigate into two categories. It has listed the 20 cooperatives declared problematic ones by the government’s Crisis-ridden Cooperatives Management Committee in its schedule 1 and nine others including those linked to the Gorkha Media Network in the schedule 2.The committee had planned to first listen to the victims who deposited money in the cooperatives listed in the schedule 1 and then move on to schedule 2.After listening to the cooperative victims’ grievances on Wednesday, the committee members decided to hold discussions on the cooperatives listed in the schedule 2.“Soon, the parliamentary special probe committee will start discussion on the fourth point [that mentions the schedule 2],” Lekh Nath Dahal, a member of the parliamentary special probe committee, told the Post.As per the ToR, the probe panel will conduct a study and make recommendations on resolving legal and institutional issues faced by cooperatives and on regulations, supervision, and transparency of their financial systems.Coordinators of various struggle committees formed by cooperative victims were also present during the discussion. Chair of the parliamentary probe panel, Surya Thapa, a lawmaker from CPN-UML, said that they invited the representatives to listen to their grievances as the victims’ suggestions would be crucial in reaching a conclusion on the matter.Speaking in a discussion with the House committee, Shaligram Duwadi, a victim of Sahara Multi-Purpose Cooperatives from Chitwan, said that Rs510 million was rerouted from the cooperative to the Gorkha Media Network.“We tried to lodge the complaint against Gorkha Media Network with Chitwan Police but they refused to register our complaint after they saw the name of Gorkha Media Network,” Duwadi was quoted as saying by a member of the special probe committee. “Why was the case not registered by Chitwan Police?”Likewise, the committee member said Krishna Pariyar, a cooperative victim of Swarnalaxmi Saving and Credit Cooperative of Kathmandu, also accused Home Minister Lamichhane of abusing state power by not letting him withdraw his money and cash his cheque.“Though the victims of many cooperatives were present in the meeting today [Wednesday], the discussion was more focused on the chairman and managing director of Gorkha Media Network,” said the committee member.According to the committee member, the victims stressed that no matter how powerful these two people [Rai and Lamichhane] are, they should be booked under the law.The parliamentary special probe committee invited representatives from 29 cooperatives mentioned in the ToR but most of those present at the meeting were victims from the cooperatives linked to the media company, according to committee members.“Though victims from other cooperatives were also present at the committee meeting, most of them were those whose money was embezzled by the Gorkha Media Network,” Ishwari Devi Neupane, a probe committee member representing Nepali Congress, told the Post. Listed under schedule 2 of the ToR or linked to the media company are: the Ideal Yamuna Multipurpose Cooperative, the Image Saving and Credit Cooperative, the Sahara Saving and Cooperative, the Samanata Saving and Credit Cooperative, the Sano Paila Saving and Credit Cooperative, the Supreme Saving and Credit Cooperative, the Suryadarshan Saving and Credit Cooperative, the Sumeru Saving and Credit Cooperative and the Swarnalaxmi Saving and Credit Cooperative.Reportedly, money from Butwal-based Supreme Saving and Credit Cooperative, Suryadarshan Saving and Credit and Cooperative of Pokhara, Sahara Saving and Cooperative of Chitwan, Swarnalaxmi Saving and Credit Cooperative of Kathmandu, Sano Paila Saving and Credit Cooperative of Birgunj, and Nepalgunj’s Samantha Saving and Credit Cooperative has been rerouted to the Gorkha Media Network.Before this, the committee held discussions with top government officials including Secretary of the Ministry of Home Affairs Ek Narayan Aryal and Inspector General of Police (IGP) Basanta Bahadur Kunwar, among other officials, on July 4 to discuss the cooperatives under investigation.On the same day, Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) Chief Shyam Gyawali and Crime Investigation Department Chief Tek Bahadur Tamang were also called for the discussion.As per a probe committee member, some committee members grilled IGP Kunwar about his previous statement in the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee. Speaking at the parliamentary committee in the last week of March, the Nepal Police chief had claimed that police had found no evidence of Home Minister Lamichhane’s involvement in cooperative fraud.“When I made the statement in the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee about the home minister, his involvement in the scam had not been disclosed,” a committee member quoted IGP Kunwar as saying at the special committee meeting. Another member of the probe committee, Shishir Khanal, said the IGP said he was not under any pressure to give a statement about Home Minister Lamichhane. Khanal is a lawmaker from the Lamichhane-led Rastriya Swatantra Party.“The IGP said that he spoke on the basis of facts and that no information regarding Home Minister Lamichhane’s involvement in the cooperatives scam had been found till the day he made the statement.”Also, the committee held discussions with chiefs and representatives of various panels formed since 1990 to probe irregularities in the cooperative sector.The parliamentary special panel will make recommendations on safeguarding depositors’ savings, and quick and easy refunds for victims whose deposits have been embezzled.The panel also agreed to probe crisis-ridden cooperatives and fast-track the refund process for the depositors of the cooperatives concerned.The parliamentary special probe committee began its work a month ago after a month-long discussion with top officials from government agencies as well as chiefs and members of various panels formed so far by the government to look into problems involving cooperatives. \nPrime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal has said that CPN-UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli had hatched a conspiracy against him and the government and joined hands with the Nepali Congress to form a new coalition by dismantling the UML-Maoist Centre alliance prematurely.The four-month-long partnership between Dahal and Oli collapsed after the UML chief sealed a yet-to-be-disclosed seven-point agreement with Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba on the midnight of July 2. Speaking at a meeting of the Maoist Centre’s parliamentary committee on Wednesday, the embattled prime minister accused Oli of betraying him. After the UML recalled its ministers from the Dahal Cabinet and withdrew its support to the government, Dahal is seeking the vote of confidence in the House of Representatives on Friday.“Oli betrayed me for no reason,” said Dahal. “We came to know that the Nepali Congress and the UML were inching towards a political deal but Oli lied to me several times about it.”On the morning of July 2, Dahal and Oli had a three-hour-long conversation at his residence in Baluwatar but Oli did not tell him the truth about what he had agreed with Deuba. “If you are going to become the prime minister with the support of Nepali Congress, I will quit and help you,” Dahal shared with the party’s lawmakers about what he had told Oli. But Oli had flatly denied having reached an agreement with the Congress, according to Maoist leaders.Hitraj Pandey, the chief whip of the Maoist Centre, quoted Dahal as saying that Oli did not want to inform him about the deal with Deuba. According to Congress and UML leaders, Deuba, Oli and second rank leaders of both parties had met regularly for months ahead of the July 2 deal.After second-rank leaders worked out the fundamentals of the new political deal and power-sharing, Deuba and Oli gave it a final touch at midnight on July 2 at the residence of a businessman.Dahal and Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Rabi Lamichhane have been claiming that after the arrest of Bechan Jha in the fake Bhutanese refugee case, Deuba and Oli joined forces in order to protect some of their close aides and family members. According to Nepal Police officials, Jha, who claimed to be an influential power broker, had established good connections with top Congress and UML leaders. Citing their initial findings of interrogation with other suspects they had arrested, police said individuals had given millions of rupees to Jha to facilitate their travel to the United States on the guise of Bhutanese refugees. Some of the accused who masterminded the fake Bhutanese refugee scam are in police custody. Jha’s arrest made the Congress and UML leaders fearful of being arrested, said the Maoist and Swatantra Party leaders. Briefing his party’s lawmakers, Dahal said that he then telephoned Deuba to know what exactly had happened between them. Deuba’s reply was that he and Oli had already reached a deal. He reportedly turned down Dahal's offer to lead the government, according to Pandey.But UML leaders, including their general secretary Shankar Pokhrel, Deputy General Secretary Pradeep Gyawali and others, claimed that after Dahal returned from New Delhi, he started negotiations for new government formation with Deuba and offered him the leadership of a national government.“After we came to know that the prime minister was hatching a conspiracy and going to destabilise the country's politics by changing the ruling partners, we decided to initiate talks with the Congress for the sake of forming a stable government, giving people hope and amending some constitutional provisions,” UMl leaders said. Dahal returned from New Delhi on June 10 after attending the swearing-in ceremony of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Dahal is seeking a vote of confidence on Friday. On Wednesday, the Nagarik Unmukti Party also decided to withdraw the support extended to the Dahal government. The government has already been reduced to a minority after the UML pulled the plug on it last week.“We will talk to all political parties and seek their support,” said Pandey, the Maoist Centre chief whip. The prime minister will mull his resignation only after the vote of trust in the House, said Pandey. Dahal, who was elected prime minister as per Article 76 (2) of the constitution, claims that the next government will be formed as per Article 76 (3) of the constitution. If the President upholds the spirit of the constitution, he should call for new government formation as per Article 76 (3), Pandey said. \nFormer prime minister and CPN-UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli, who is set to become prime minister next week, defended his seven-point deal with Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba. However, Oli said that the intricacies of constitutional amendments, which the two largest parties have reportedly agreed to in principle, have yet to be finalised.Speaking at a meeting of the party’s secretariat on Wednesday, Oli said that the two parties have agreed to the need to amend the constitution to protect national interests, make Nepal prosperous and the Nepalis happy, but the details have not been worked out.Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is set to go for a floor test on Friday after the UML and some other coalition partners withdrew their support to the government. As per the agreement reached between Deuba and Oli on July 2, the UML chair will become the prime minister early next week.Giving reasons why the first and second largest parties in the House of Representatives had come together for government formation, Oli stated that the current tendencies to allow private and partisan interests to dominate state affairs, and fringe parties with few lawmakers claiming the post of chief minister and their unusual manoeuvrings needed to be defeated by the partnership of the two parties.Deuba has already endorsed Oli as the next prime minister. The two parties will have a more or less equal number of Cabinet ministers, though they have yet to enter into the power-sharing deal.“Some are trying to create an illusion about the agreements signed between the Nepali Congress and the UML. Some were trying to pay their lip service to amending the constitution, but they actually engaged in making the constitution a failure. In due course of time some constitutional provisions should be revisited, so we have stressed the need for amendments,” said Oli.After the meeting, UML deputy general secretary Pradeep Gyawali said the statements made by Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane were not true. After the government decided to open more cases of corruption targeting top leaders of the Congress and the UML, the two parties came together overnight to topple the government, Dahal and Lamichhane have said publicly.But that is merely a political stunt, said Gyawali. Who stopped them from opening corruption cases in the last four months?“Prachanda ji had been in the government for 10 months [until he pushed the Congress out of the coalition], but what stopped him from opening the corruption cases? Rabi ji became the minister for six months over two terms. What stopped him from investigating the cases?” Gyawali asked. “These are only stunts. After failing to run the country and the government [effectively], they need some excuse which they are making. They kept saying this in the past week.”There is a large section, including the CPN (Maoist Centre) and others, that has critically taken the issue of charter amendment. But we have not discussed which constitutional provisions will go for the changes, he said. Those constitutional reforms will be based on the experience of a decade. The constitution was promulgated in September 2015. The agreement between the Congress and UML to amend it has made the political fraternity and activists and observers curious.No agreement has been reached on who will lead the commission that will suggest amending and reforming the constitutional provisions, he added.“Some are trying to create an illusion after the Nepali Congress and the UML came up with a deal. They are also saying that the agreement has taken the constitution towards anarchy, political instability and confusion. We see the governments in provinces are changing frequently or every month. Private and partisan interests dominated, instability and bargaining were rampant, and parties frequently changed the camps,” Oli shared his observation. “Development activities, necessities and requirements of the people had never been at the centre, but corruption and instability were dominated and rampant. So, how can we stop such a tendency? That is why we, the Nepali Congress and the UML, came together,” said Oli.Any attempt to fail the constitution, and weaken federalism is not accepted, he said the constitution is the dynamic document; it should guide society so the constitution should be amended as per the context of the time. Oli is all set to become the prime minister by early next week, but the Nepali Congress and UML have not settled the power-sharing deal, including the division of the ministerial portfolio, according to Oli.Oli said the power-sharing deal will be concrete only after the new government takes shape. “We will try to bring more parties into the government. We are in discussion with them. In general, the allocation of the ministries will be made as per the strength of the political party,” he added.The division of ministerial portfolios will be decided only after Friday or after Prime Minister Dahal fails to get the vote of confidence in the House of Representatives.The UML has issued a whip to all its lawmakers to vote against Dahal on Friday.Oli told the party meeting that smaller parties are also likely to join his government, according to one UML leader. There was a general understanding between the Congress and the UML of dividing 19 ministries between them.From the UML, Bishnu Poudel will be in the government as the finance minister. But there is no decision in the Congress on who will lead the party’s ministers in the Oli cabinet. It could be the party general secretary Gagan Thapa or one among senior leaders like Krishna Prasad Sitaula and Prakash Man Singh. Deuba wants Ramesh Lekhak to serve as the home minister, a leader close to the party president said.Oli is in a mood to form a governing team of both experienced and new faces, UML leaders said. Choosing ministers is more difficult for Deuba due to multiple power centres in the party led by Thapa, Sitaula, Singh and Shekhar Koirala. There is also the need to balance gender, region, and ethnic clusters in the party’s picks.The Congress has already endorsed the two-party deal. Oli is tipped to lead a ‘national consensus government’ for a year and a half, before handing the reins over to Deuba who will lead the administration until the general elections in 2027.Deuba and Oli have also agreed to review the electoral system, proportional representation, the composition of the National Assembly, and the size of provincial assemblies. The Congress and the UML will lead three provincial governments each, leaving the provincial government in Madhesh that is led by CK Raut’s Janamat Party. \nIn a bid to lessen the spread of the dengue virus during the ongoing monsoon season, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City has decided to continue the drive to destroy mosquito larvae and breeding grounds. Officials at the health department of the city office said on Friday that they have just completed a week-long drive in all 32 wards of the metropolis and plan to continue these efforts in the coming days as well.“Every Wednesday, our health volunteers will visit households and open spaces to destroy mosquito breeding grounds,” said Rishi Bhusal, epidemic prevention and control focal person at the metropolis. “Decisions on preventive measures including launching search and destroy drives will depend on the spread of virus and intensity of rainfall in the coming days.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vectors also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus, according to the World Health Organisation.According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,268 people from 72 districts have been infected with the dengue virus since January this year. Among the 72 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases: 141. Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and can be treated with paracetamol at home.Dengue symptoms include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes. Patients with these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and proper medical care can prevent death.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district. Since then, an increasing number of dengue infections have been reported from many districts, including major dengue outbreaks. Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Though the post-monsoon period is considered the dengue epidemic season, the deadly disease has already become endemic in Nepal, as outbreaks of the virus are reported every month, including in the winter months.Officials at the health department said that 654 health workers, including female community health volunteers, were deployed in the week-long campaign, which concluded on Friday.“Volunteers and health workers who were deployed to the door-to-door campaign checked the mosquito breeding grounds and the larvae, made people aware about the risks and destroyed the breeding grounds,” said Bhusal. Health workers reported that storage places for scrap materials, discarded cups, and plastic in open spaces, and unused lands as potential hotspots for the dengue virus in the coming days. Health workers have warned owners of these sites that action will be taken if mosquito larvae are found against the owner of the storage place if mosquito larvae were found.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects, such as plastic cups and bottles, could be breeding grounds for these mosquitoes.Public health experts say now is the right time to prepare for and prevent possible outbreaks. Health ministry officials said they have alerted all related agencies to the risk of a dengue outbreak. \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City has imparted mental health screening training to doctors and paramedics serving at urban health promotion centres.Officials at the Health Department in the metropolis hope that the move will help hundreds of patients with mental health issues in the city to get timely treatment.“Getting free treatment for mental health problems comes under the right to get free basic health care services,” said Sajina Maharjan, acting head of the department. “Mental health problem screening training to doctors and paramedics will help in the timely diagnosis of the problems and start of early treatment.”At least 32 doctors serving at the urban health promotion centres under the city office and dozens of paramedics participated in five-day screening training. The metropolis has upgraded its urban health clinics to urban health promotion centres and started providing services through medical doctors. “Due to the lack of doctors at our urban health promotion centres, patients suffering from mental health problems have been deprived of timely treatment,” said Nali Bajracharya, a senior public health officer at the department. “Now patients having mental health issues and seeking care at our health centres will also get mental health treatment.”Though neither the federal government agency nor the city office has data on the number of people suffering from mental health problems in the metropolis, doctors estimated that a lot of people could be suffering from various forms of mental health problems—anxiety, depression and others.Officials say that they are also planning to provide free medication to patients with mental health problems.Health workers say that many city dwellers, despite having mental health problems, do not seek treatment and instead turn to drugs and substances to cope. Due to the entrenched social stigma, fear of discrimination and other factors, many patients in Nepal do not talk about their mental health issues.The general tendency among people to conceal mental health issues due to the stigma attached to it has also forced patients to opt for substance abuse, doctors say.They say that while drugs and alcohol may provide temporary relief from stress, they are not a solution and can adversely affect mental health and well-being in the long run.“Treatment in the initial stage of mental illness helps patients achieve better results. For that, early diagnosis is crucial,” said Dr Pomawati Thapa, chief of the Non-communicable Disease and Mental Health Section at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Other local units should also follow the initiative to provide mental health screening training to health workers, including doctors.”Nepal is among the countries with highest rates of suicide, which is an extreme manifestation of a mental health problem.According to Nepal Police data, 6,993 people took their own lives in the fiscal year 2022-2023. This accounts for more than 19 deaths on average daily. Fifty-six percent of those who die by suicide are men.Doctors say that people do not attempt suicide for a single reason, but due to a complex situation arising from multiple problems.An increasing number of people are struggling with mental problems owing to the rising cost of living and the struggle to manage even their most basic needs, such as food, housing, healthcare and jobs, experts say.Whatever the cause, suicides and suicide attempts have a ripple effect, impacting families, friends, colleagues, communities and societies, doctors say.A study carried out by the Nepal Health Research Council in the past shows that about 13 percent of Nepalis suffer from some form of mental disorder. This means around one in eight Nepalis has mental health issues. Moreover, the country simply does not have enough experts to treat mental health problems, it added.Studies show the magnitude of suffering, the burden and costs for individuals, families and societies arising from mental health disorders are alarming in Nepal.“No doubt, mental health problems have been emerging as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in our country,” said Thapa. “All local governments must take initiative to address the problems. Only the federal government agencies cannot do much.”The World Health Organisation says that one in four people in the world has been affected by mental or neurological disorders at some point in their lives, and around 450 million people currently suffer from such conditions, placing mental disorders among the leading causes of ill health and disability worldwide. \nDuring the 2022 local level election, people of Kathmandu elected independent candidate Balendra Shah as their mayor for five years. Sunita Dangol of the CPN-UML secured the position of KMC deputy mayor in the same election. When they began their term, many suspected that the two—an independent mayor and his party-affiliated deputy—wouldn’t have cordial relations. But, in the last two years of their term, there has been no visible disagreement between them. They proved their sceptics wrong.Deputy Mayor Dangol kept mum when Mayor Shah accused her party chair, KP Sharma Oli, of policy corruption in the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate land scam.Moreover, Shah expressed his anger on June 3 over the government’s intervention in his plan to widen pavements in the New Road area. Deputy Prime Minister Raghubir Mahaseth of the UML leads the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, which maintains major roads.After the ministry intervened in the municipal plan to expand the sidewalk on New Road, Shah took to social media and wrote, “Honourable KP Oli jyu, don’t hoodwink people by engineering yet another scam to hide a scam of Rs10,000 crore [Rs100 billion].”He further added, “You have reassured those who had made advance payments to buy land of Giri Bandhu Tea Estate that they would get the land within two years.” “If one looks at the policy corruption in the tea estate, it appears not a single leaf would stir without Oli’s nod,” Shah wrote.A few days prior to the incident, Mayor Shah had engaged in a heated debate with Chinkaji Maharjan, a UML member and chairman of KMC’s ward 22, over the sidewalk expansion plan.Dangol remained quiet on the issue thus far. However, at the city council meeting on Monday, which also discussed KMC's policies and programmes for the fiscal year 2024-25, she criticised Mayor Shah for his remarks.“This should be the first time the deputy mayor opposed the public behavior and statement of the mayor,” a Kathmandu ward chairperson told the Post on the condition of anonymity.Dangol had her initial plan to contest the mayor position independently but the UML gave her the deputy mayor’s ticket.Speaking during the Monday discussion, Deputy Mayor Dangol said, addressing Mayor Shah, “Your and mine voices are being heard and watched by Nepalis worldwide. Therefore, those of us who want to come to politics should think about our expression,” Dangol remarked. “We should maintain the image and dignity of the institution we represent.”She also emphasised the need to accommodate the voices of everyone in an undertaking.Though the representatives of Kathmandu Metropolitan City claim that Dangol's Monday statement was unusual, they deny any rift between the two leaders of the local government. “City council’s is an internal meeting of the KMC where various issues arise. We settle those issues internally,” Nabin Manandhar, the KMC spokesperson and ward 17 chairman from the Nepali Congress, told the Post. “Having an opinion does not necessarily mean criticism.”Rajesh Kumar Shrestha, chair of KMC ward 19, seconded Manandhar.However, local representatives of Kathmandu have been questioning Shah for his ‘lone-wolf’ manner of leading the institution.“We should develop a working relationship that welcomes everyone’s spirit,” Dangol told the council meeting. “If one thinks they are in a position and everything should be done as they say, it will only lead to trouble.”She added, “While working in a team, we definitely have a different opinion, but different opinions should be respected.”At the meeting, referring to Mayor Shah's past statements, council member Anita Karki asked him, saying, “What if the voters of Kathmandu set ablaze the Durbar where the KMC office lies?”In September last year, when the traffic police obstructed a KMC vehicle, later known to be used by his postpartum wife, Mayor Shah provocatively wrote on Facebook, threatening to burn Singha Durbar, the federal government’s central secretariat.Traffic police, under the federal government, had stopped the vehicle to check necessary documents on a Saturday.After the incident, Shah wrote on social media warning that if the government blocked KMC's vehicles again, he would set fire to Singha Durbar.Dangol said on Monday that she believed it was wrong to write on social media or make a statement inciting people to burn the Singha Durbar or the Bagh Durbar, where the KMC office is situated.Dangol, speaking at the city council meeting, also said there should be no polarisation between the representatives who were elected to develop Kathmandu. \nA police officer was found dead on the premises of the federal parliament building in Baneshwar, Kathmandu on Wednesday.According to Ekram Giri, spokesperson for the federal parliament secretariat, Ajit Gole of Dolakha committed suicide by shooting himself.The body of the victim was recovered from the parliament building’s washroom.Dinesh Mainali, spokesperson for the Kathmandu Metro Police Range, said Gole, who was on duty from 6am to 10am, was found dead at around 8 in the morning. “A constable of Nepal Police was found dead inside a toilet of the parliament building,” Mainali told the Post. “Preliminary investigation shows he was inflicted with a gunshot.”Nepal police said the investigation is underway. \nPolice on Friday arrested two people from Thimi of Bhaktapur for allegedly mining cryptocurrency.The Central Investigation Bureau took 50-year-old Biswas Gurung and Rajendra Tahamata, 25, into custody in connection with the crime, said Hobindra Bogati, spokesperson for the bureau.The duo allegedly ran mining operations from the CTEVT’s information technology lab using a server and 64 desktops, on which blockchain applications were found during a preliminary investigation. Further investigation into the matter is underway. \nKot Ghar, once considered the seat of powerful Malla kings of Galkot, a pretty kingdom in the confederation of 24 states known as Chaubisi Rajya, has been restored and preserved to draw tourists.The Kot Ghar means a house where weapons are placed or stored. The town of Galkot once served as the fortress of the hilly kingdom ruled by the Mallas. The historical palace, which has been renovated, offers a reason to visit Galkot.Before the Panchayat era, Galkot served as Baglung's headquarters. Without the administrative offices, the locals seek to make Galkot the tourism headquarters of Baglung.According to history, Jitari Malla, the elder son of King Narayan Malla of Parbat, established Galkot Rajya in 1631 BS.A stone inscription states that Kot Ghar was constructed in 1661 BS. Galkot was free until Jagat Pratap Malla's rule in 1844 BS. The local government has been trying to preserve the historical artefacts to showcase to the visitors. The ancient palace of Galkot was in dire straits because of the lack of conservation.The Shreemeher Gana barracks of the Nepal Army and Galkot municipality have jointly renovated the almost-collapsed Kot Ghar.Professor Din Bahadur Thapa, a historian, said that the state also produced rice during the 10th generation of kings 213 years ago. After that, until 2015 BS, the kings of Galkot remained rulers. After the last king, Bharat Bam Malla, was elected to parliament in the 2015 BS general election, Raja Rajouta stepped down. There is a history of Bharat Bam submitting a proposal to remove Raja Rajauta from the House of Representatives.Thapa's research mentions that the state of Galkot extended to Kathekhola in the east, Pandavakhani in the west, Rum in Myagdi in the north, and Musikot in Gulmi in the south. After the kingdom was taken away, Jagat Pratap Bam Malla moved the palace to Shraddhakhet. The last king, Bharat Bam, built a palace in Harichor Bazar in 1990 BS. The construction started in 1978 BS.Even until 2019 BS, the central administrative units of Baglung were in Galkot. Later, they were shifted to Baglung Bazaar. The Kot Ghar conservation and tourism promotion programme was started five years ago to reflect this legacy. Bir Jung Bhandari, former ward chairman of Galkot Municipality, had started some of the works.Bharat Sharma Gaire, mayor of the municipality, said that the historic city planning and the work to preserve the history had been completed with the help of the Nepal Army.Cannoning infrastructure has also been built at Sahasradhara waterfall near Kot Ghar. Festivals are organised during the Dashain and Chaite Dashain. Hundreds of pilgrims tour these religious sites annually.Locals conduct regular worship. A hundred houses in Kotmaidan village offer worship by taking ownership. It is listed in the city pride project.The weapons in Kot Ghar have been kept separately by making a new home. The doors and windows of Kot Ghar have been modelled on the Bhaktapur craft. On the way to Kot Ghar, a barbed wire fence and railing have been set up.Drainage and culverts have been constructed in some road stretches that reach Kot Ghar from the mid-hill highway. The municipality has been investing yearly to pave the road to Kot Ghar. The location is important from the tourism perspective.Galkot Valley, Ghumte hill, Daram River, and Tara River can be viewed from Kot Ghar. Kalika temple, near Kot Ghar, has also been maintained.Nearly 100 ropanies have been protected through barbed wire fences. The number of tourists visiting Kot Ghar has recently increased with the construction of drinking water taps and resting areas.The association of the former army conducted a district-level annual general meeting in the Kot Ghar area.It is presumed that the state was named Galkot, derived from ‘Golo Kot’, the way the Kot Ghar was built.Kot Ghar, located in Galkot Municipality-3, was the first seat of the kings. Though the king shifted to Harichaur through Shraddakhet, the weapons were kept in Kot Ghar and Kalika temple. Other structures were also built around Kot Ghar. Gaire said the places of historical importance were protected. A six-kilometre road has been built from the mid-hill highway to Kot Ghar.The road to Kot Ghar from the highway was maintained and paved, said Pham Bahadur Khatri, the ward chairman. He said that around Rs1.5 million was spent to renovate Kot Ghar, and the Nepal Army provided Rs900,000 and the human resources. \nThe government last week raised the minimum support price for paddy by more than 6.5 percent for the harvest of the next fiscal year, 2023-24, soon after the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led administration was reduced to a minority.This was the second time the government fixed the minimum support price during the paddy transplantation period. The Ministry of Commerce and Supplies tabled the proposal to increase the price, which was approved by the Cabinet meeting on July 4.The government decided to increase the minimum support price of common paddy to Rs3,580.62 per quintal (Rs35.80 per kg), up 6.50 percent. Similarly, the floor price for ‘mota dhan’ has been increased to Rs3,410.51 per quintal (Rs34.10 per kg), up 6.64 percent.The minimum support price is the lowest legal price that farmers receive for their harvests. The government does not fix the floor price of fine paddy.A minimum support price is an intervention by the government to protect farmers against sudden slumps in market prices. It is the rate at which the government buys farm produce when no other buyers are in the market.Usually, it is announced in time for farmers to make their production plans before the beginning of the planting season. Under the scheme, the government has to buy a certain amount of the total paddy harvest.In 2012, the government announced the resumption of the policy of fixing the minimum price following complaints that middlemen had been determining the market rate.Until 1999, the minimum support price for paddy and wheat would be announced regularly.According to reports, the practice was fully abandoned that year after the government launched the 20-year Agriculture Perspective Plan.Even when the minimum support price was announced, it was irrelevant as it was set well below the projected market price to protect the government from having to buy farm products should prices tumble.Moreover, reports said that even when support prices were announced, it was not done in time.The policy was irregular.In 2016-17, the minimum support price was announced in mid-November. In 2017-2018, the Cabinet sent back the supplies ministry's proposal. In 2021-22, the government announced the minimum support price for paddy on November 3, which is harvest time. The price was raised by 8 percent.On different occasions, members of parliamentary committees have criticised the government policy as ‘absurd’ because it was announced after many farmers had already harvested and sold their crops. Lawmakers said that the minimum support price was supposed to encourage farmers to boost output, but the government-fixed floor price had ‘discouraged’ them instead.It was only since the last fiscal year that the government announced the price before the transplantation season started.Paddy is transplanted in June and harvested by the end of October.This year, as of Sunday, paddy transplantation has been completed on 539,766 hectares as of Sunday, which is 38.6 percent of Nepal's 1.39 million hectares of paddy fields.Tilak Raj Chaulagain, a senior agro economist at the Department of Agriculture, said that the paddy transplantation rate was slightly lower (by 4 percent) compared to the same period last year. This year, the monsoon entered Nepal from the east on June 10, three days ahead of its usual onset date, according to the Meteorological Forecasting Division.Chaulagain said that the monsoon arrived on time, but it took time to be active. “As a result, transplantation was delayed slightly in the hills, but this will not affect production or productivity.\"According to Chaulagain, while transplantation on the hills is nearing completion, it will pick up pace in Tarai from mid-July. The Tarai, the largest paddy-producing region in the country, accounts for 71 percent of the total rice acreage. The hills account for 25 percent, and the mountain region for 4 percent.“Since there are no reports of a shortage of chemical fertilisers this year, we expect transplantation to be completed within a month and a half at this pace,” said Chaulagain.According to the department, Madhesh has the lowest translation rate of all provinces. In Madhesh province, which commands the lion’s share of the paddy fields, transplantation has been completed on 97,851 hectares, which is 25.5 percent of the 383,150 hectares available paddy fields in the province. Nepal’s economic well-being is closely tied to the rainy season. Rainwater is the lifeblood of Nepal's Rs5.70 trillion economy, which relies heavily on agriculture, with nearly two-thirds of the farmlands being rain-fed.During the four months of June to September, a large part of the country receives nearly 80 percent of its annual rainfall.The production of food grain, mainly rice, depends on the amount and distribution of monsoon rainfall over the country. The monsoon rains also replenish groundwater and reservoirs critical for drinking and power generation. \nIn a bid to support midwives and other healthcare personnel in ensuring safer births in low-resource settings, the Ministry of Health and Population has launched a “safe delivery app”.Officials hope that the mobile application will complement and enhance the ongoing capacity-building of health workers and help in reducing maternal and newborn deaths.“The Safe Delivery App provides up-to-date lifesaving procedures and practical guidance in the local language,” said Dr Bibek Kumar Lal, director of the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services, at the launch of the Nepali version of the Safe Delivery App. “It aims to improve the quality of emergency obstetric and newborn care, and the main users will be our frontline health workers, especially nurses and midwives.”Officials at the division said that the government has collaborated with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the Maternity Foundation (MF) to launch the Nepali version of the widely used digital health tool.Globally, every two minutes, a woman dies. In Nepal, two women die every day due to pregnancy-related complications—most of which are preventable, said Won Young Hong, a UNFPA representative in Nepal. “These are staggering numbers. UNFPA is pleased to work with the concerned stakeholders to localise this digital application so healthcare workers across Nepal can use it.”The Safe Delivery App is an evidence-based learning and training tool designed to support midwives, nurses, and other healthcare professionals to assist during births and to manage the most common complications. Among other features, it contains the latest clinical guidelines, animated instruction videos, descriptions of practical procedures, and action cards. It is free, and once downloaded on a smartphone or a tablet, it works offline, making it possible to be used even in the most remote areas. To date, more than 435,000 healthcare professionals across more than 70 countries have been reached through the Safe Delivery App and the accompanying programme worldwide, with Nepal being the latest country to introduce the App. “We will work with provincial governments and development partners to quickly roll out the App throughout Nepal,” said Lal.Nepal cut the maternal mortality rate from 539 per 100,000 births in 1996 to 239 per 100,000 births in 2016—for which the country even received a Millennium Award. According to the National Statistics Office report, the country has further reduced the number of deaths to 151 per 100,000 births in 2021. Maternal health experts, however, say that even if the country has made good progress in reducing maternal deaths, the current maternal mortality ratio is more than double the Sustainable Development Goals target, which is 70 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births by 2030.Neonatal deaths have not declined between 2016 and 2022, according to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022 carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population.The government’s target for the Sustainable Development Goals was to reduce neonatal mortality to 16 deaths per 1,000 live births by 2022 and 12 in every 1,000 live births by 2030.The SDGs, a follow-up on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), aim to end poverty, hunger, and all forms of inequality worldwide by 2030, and Nepal has committed to meeting the goals.The health ministry has been taking several measures to reduce maternal and neonatal deaths, including installing an underfloor heating system at birthing centres, setting up special newborn care units, training doctors, nurses, and paramedics in the district hospitals and distributing non-pneumatic anti-shock garments to prevent maternal deaths from excessive bleeding.Besides, the ministry provides free service and travel allowances for those opting for institutional delivery and antenatal visits. It also distributes misoprostol, a medication used to treat postpartum bleeding in new mothers, through female community health volunteers. \nAs heavy monsoon rains cause chaos across the country, dengue cases are surging in several districts, including Kathmandu.According to the Health Office Kathmandu, around 18 people are infected with the dengue virus every day. Officials, however, admit that this number could be just the tip of the iceberg, as the office gets reports only from 18 health facilities.“Yes, the number of people infected with the dengue virus could be several times higher than suggested by the reports we are getting every day,” said Dr Arjun Sapkota, chief of the Health Office, Kathmandu. “We are working to make daily reporting of dengue cases mandatory for private health facilities as well.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vectors also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus, according to the World Health Organisation.According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,432 people from 73 districts have been infected with the virus since January this year. Among the 73 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases with 159, followed by Jhapa with 120, Chitwan 83, Makawanpur 65, Tanahun and Doti 49 cases each, and Okhaldhunga and Sindhupalchowk 46 each.Sapkota informed that his office has sensitised the local bodies about the looming risk of a massive dengue outbreak in the coming days.“Mandatory reporting of dengue cases every day is among the preventive measures through which we can identify dengue hotspots,” said Sapkota. “This will help health workers target such measures in particular areas. Additionally, starting this week, we are resuming the “10 minutes at 10 am” initiative every Friday, during which mosquito breeding grounds will be destroyed.”Officials informed that several local units, including the Kathmandu Metropolitan City, have already started preventive measures against dengue. Dengue symptoms include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes. Patients with these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and proper medical care can prevent death.Doctors say many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and can be treated with paracetamol at home.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district. Since then, an increasing number of dengue infections, including major outbreaks, have been reported from many districts. Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Though the post-monsoon period is considered the dengue epidemic season, the deadly disease has already become endemic in Nepal, as outbreaks are reported every month, including in the winter months.According to health workers, storage places for scrap materials, discarded cups, plastic material tossed in open spaces, and unused lands will be potential hotspots for the dengue virus in the coming days. Health workers have warned the owners of these sites that action will be taken if mosquito larvae are found there.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects, such as plastic cups and bottles, could be breeding grounds for these mosquitoes. \nWith monsoon havoc sweeping across the country, the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division has urged health workers to avoid taking leave during the season.Officials have warned that health facilities could be overwhelmed by patients in the coming days as outbreaks of waterborne and vector-borne diseases are expected, as floodwaters have contaminated most of the drinking water sources.“We have requested the provincial and local health authorities not to grant leave to health workers during the monsoon season,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director of the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Health agencies have been cautioned about the looming risk of outbreaks of waterborne and vector-borne diseases in the coming days.”Torrential rainfall started Friday wreaking havoc in various places across the country. At least 14 people have died in disaster-related incidents—nine in landslides and five in floods—since Friday, according to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority. Officials said 18 others have been injured, and four people are missing. Since the monsoon entered the country on June 10, at least 43 people have died in landslides and flood-related incidents. Lightning strikes killed as many as 19 people during this period.The monsoon season in Nepal is a time of epidemics during which thousands of people across the country become infected with water-borne and vector-borne diseases.The persistent rainfall that started on Friday not only destroyed houses and inundated settlements but also contaminated drinking water sources.Health officials warned that health facilities could witness an uptick in the number of viral fever cases, and waterborne diseases—diarrhoea, dysentery, food poisoning, and snake bites—in the coming days.“We have also requested central hospitals and medical colleges to be prepared for help during disease outbreaks,” said Ghimire. “As we don’t have enough doctors and health workers to deploy to control the outbreaks, we have to seek help from big hospitals and medical colleges.”Officials at the Ministry of Health and Population said that they have been raising awareness through all available means to inform people of the risks. “Essential medicines have been stockpiled, health workers have been asked to be ready for deployment to affected areas, anti-snake venom has been supplied to health facilities,” said Dr Prakash Budhathoki, spokesperson at the Health Ministry. “As of Sunday evening, no outbreaks have been reported.”According to health experts, sources of drinking water generally become contaminated in disaster-hit areas, and people displaced by natural disasters become highly vulnerable to infections with waterborne and vector-borne diseases. Every year, thousands of people get infected with vector-borne diseases such as dengue, kala-azar, malaria, and scrub typhus during this period. Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts. According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,432 people from 73 districts have been infected with the dengue virus since January this year. Among the 73 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases: 159. Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. Likewise, snakebite incidents and resulting deaths are also common during the season, but the phenomenon, which experts dub “a lurking invisible crisis”, remains grossly neglected. “Incidents of snakebites have started to surge over the last few weeks,” said Dr Rajiv Jha, director at Provincial Health Directorate of Madhesh Province. “Along with the surge in waterborne and vector-borne diseases in the coming days, we have anticipated a rise in snakebite cases.”Doctors say the only ways to prevent deaths from waterborne diseases, including diarrhoea, are to raise awareness and ensure safe drinking water.They say a combination of careful surveys, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation and treatment are required to contain the spread of the diarrhoeal infection. \nWith the onset of the rainy season, the incidents of snakebite are on the rise in western Tarai districts.Snakebite treatment centres and hospitals in Kanchanpur and Kailali districts of Sudurpaschim province are now crowded with snakebite patients. Treatment of the snakebite patients, according to health workers, is quite challenging as patients are often brought to the health facilities at the last minute.As many as 60 snakebite patients visited the Snakebite Treatment Centre set up by Nepal Army at Arjuni of Shuklaphanta National Park within the past three weeks. “Over the past one week three to four snakebite patients have been visiting the centre on a daily basis,” said Ratan Bohora, a paramedic at the Arjuni-based Snakebite Treatment Centre. The local residents have hugely benefited after the Nepali Army and the local community jointly established the snakebite treatment centre at Arjuni in 2014. The centre, however, has to refer the patients with serious health conditions to other well facilitated hospitals due to the lack of an intensive care unit (ICU) and ventilator. “Two patients who were bitten by poisonous snakes were referred to Mahakali Provincial Hospital in Mahendranagar this year. We have no alternative but to send serious cases of snakebite to other hospitals due to the lack of the ICU and ventilator facilities,” said Bohora. The centre also does not even have a monitor to track a patient's vital signs such as blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen levels. The flow of the patients is increasing, but the centre only has two paramedics to provide treatment.Incidents of snakebite and resulting deaths are common in Nepal, but the issue still remains grossly neglected as what experts call a lurking ‘invisible crisis’. Each year, around 2,700 people, mostly children and women from Nepal’s Tarai region, die of snakebites, according to a March 2022 report.Most snakebite incidents occur when farmers are transplanting paddy fields or children are playing outdoors. Health workers say that the snakes that live in water are generally less poisonous. “The cases that are most serious occurred at night, often inside houses. Such patients should be taken to hospital immediately,” said Bohora. According to him, people living in thatched-roof houses are especially vulnerable to snakebite, because snakes often enter such homes in search of rats.Nepal is home to around 17 highly venomous snakes. Each year, the country sees about 20,000 to 40,000 cases of snakebite. The numbers could be higher, as many cases of snakebite go unreported, health workers say.Another health challenge in rural Nepal is the superstitious belief in visiting shamans instead of seeking treatment at medical facilities for snakebite. Experts say awareness drives should be launched to educate people that the snakebite patients should be taken to the hospital at the earliest. They recommend promoting cleanliness around homes, preventing children from playing in bushy areas, avoiding nightime walks, and using torchlight while walking in the dark.“Treatment of snakebite patients is possible if they are taken to health facilities on time. Patients are often brought to the hospital only after their condition has worsened, resulting in serious consequences,” said Dr Arjun Bhatta, medical superintendent at Mahakali Provincial Hospital. According to him, 10 snakebite patients with serious health conditions visited the hospital in the past three weeks. “They returned home after treatment,” said Bhatta. \nParopakar Hospital is organizing a healthy baby competition on August 13 to promote proper baby care, including exclusive breastfeeding, vaccination, and family planning.\nA culinary journey from a first kitchen experiment leading to the development of baking skills, emphasizing precision, technique, and the joys and challenges of home baking, culminates in a recipe for indulgent \"Bliss Brownies.\"\nLGBTQIA+ individuals have historically faced discrimination and judgment, leading to the need for safe spaces like the Stonewall Inn and Inclusive Galaxy, which provide acceptance and support for the community.\nAditya Mishra, a Nepali chef in New York, founded the supper club 'The Sewing Tin' to promote Nepali cuisine, drawing inspiration from his Michelin-starred experiences while balancing traditional flavors with modern culinary styles.\nCeleus Baral, an environmental science student, combines her passion for baking with environmental awareness through her online shop, Bakeleus, showcasing her creativity and advocating for zero-waste practices.\nPotato, a staple food of hundreds of thousands of people, especially those residing in the mountainous regions, is among the most widely consumed and versatile crops in Nepal. The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar. \nThe noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built. Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nEngland finally showed their true colours at the European Championship on Wednesday, putting on a convincing and effective performance when it mattered most to book themselves a berth in Sunday’s final in Berlin.Ollie Watkins’ late winner to secure the 2-1 win over the Netherlands was as much as they deserved after dominating the encounter in a display their supporters had been eagerly awaiting but barely daring to hope for.It was an emphatic answer after the criticism heaped on the side for some languid showings against underwhelming opposition earlier in the tournament, and sets up a mouth-watering final against a slick-looking Spain.England had frustrated their followers, looking pedestrian at times in the group phase as well as their knockout round games. It was as if they were suffocating at times under a heavy burden of expectation, a feeling coach Gareth Southgate said on Tuesday that they learned to leave behind as they went deeper into the tournament.Their round of 16 performance as they edged Slovakia bordered on the miraculous, snatching victory minutes from being eliminated, and there was a nervy showing as they fought back, again, to edge Switzerland on penalties in the quarter-final.This time, however, there was a positivity about their play from the start, even if it was a third successive game where they went behind, this time to Xavi Simons’ spectacular seventh minute effort.Harry Kane’s penalty equaliser was followed by a sustained period of pressure on the Dutch defence, with England shaking off the cobwebs and properly greasing the wheels of their attack.The individual quality of their players was on full display and they had their opponents pegged back, looking dangerous every time they entered the final third. Phil Foden was exceedingly unlucky not to have them ahead at halftime with some sublime skill but had his effort cleared off the line.The second period was not as dominant as fatigue set in and the Dutch enjoyed their fair share of possession.But even then, whenever England moved menacingly forward, a goal looked on the cards.It was almost to script that they engineered victory just before the final whistle, as Watkins emerged an unlikely hero not long after coming on.The confidence boost cannot be underestimated, especially as an in-form opponent awaits on Sunday at the Olympiastadion.When they needed to stand up and be counted, the real England came to the party and, after almost a month of gritty competition, the tournament has two worthy finalists. \nColombia beat Uruguay 1-0 in their Copa America semi-final on Thursday despite being reduced to 10 men for 45 minutes to book a title decider against defending champions Argentina thanks to a first-half header from Jefferson Lerma.Uruguay’s Darwin Nunez missed several chances in the first half and Colombia made them pay when Lerma rose above the defence on a corner in the 39th minute and squeezed his header past goalkeeper Sergio Rochet.Colombia went down to 10 men just before halftime when Daniel Munoz lost his cool and got himself sent off, with the right back receiving a second yellow card for elbowing Manuel Ugarte in the chest when play was stopped.Uruguay dominated possession in the second half and veteran striker Luis Suarez nearly equalised when he hit the post but Colombia bravely held on for a famous win and will play Argentina in Sunday’s final.Uruguay will play Canada a day earlier in the third-place playoff. \nNepal's women's cricket team lost consecutive practice matches against Sri Lanka's Development Squad in preparation for the 2024 ACC Women's T20 Asia Cup.\nDefending champions Argentina advanced to the Copa America final with a 2-0 victory over Canada, courtesy of goals from Julian Alvarez and Lionel Messi, who reached several milestones with his second.\nTeenager Lamine Yamal's record-breaking goal sparked Spain's 2-1 comeback win over France, sending them to the Euro 2024 final against England or Netherlands.\nResidents of Gaza City were trapped in houses and bodies lay uncollected in the streets under an intense new Israeli assault on Thursday, even as Washington pushed for a peace deal at talks in Egypt and Qatar.Hamas militants say a heavy Israeli assault on Gaza City this week could wreck efforts to finally end the war just as negotiations have entered the home stretch.Home to more than a quarter of Gaza’s residents before the war, Gaza City was destroyed during the first weeks of fighting last year, but hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have returned to homes in the ruins. They have now once again been ordered out by the Israeli military.The Gaza health ministry said it had reports of people trapped and others killed inside their houses in the Tel Al Hawa and Sabra districts of Gaza City, and rescuers could not reach them.The Civil Emergency Service said it estimated that at least 30 people had been killed in the Tel Al-Hawa and Rimal areas and it could not recover bodies from the streets there.Despite army instructions on Wednesday to residents of Gaza City that they can use two “safe routes” to head south, many residents refused to heed the order. Some posted a hashtag on social media: “We are not leaving”.“We will die but not leave to the south. We have tolerated starvation and bombs for nine months and we are ready to die as martyrs here,” said Mohammad Ali, 30, reached by text message.Ali, whose family has relocated several times within the city, said they had been running short of food, water and medicine.“The occupation bombs Gaza City as if the war was restarting. We hope there will be a ceasefire soon, but if not then is God’s will.”Withdrawal from ShejaiaJust east of Gaza City in the Shejaia suburb, residents were returning on foot to a desolate moonscape of destroyed buildings after Israeli forces withdrew following a two-week offensive there.The territory’s main cemetery had been bulldozed by the army. People wheeled supplies on the back of bicycles across rubble-strewn tracks, passing the remains of burnt-out and blasted Israeli armoured vehicles.“We have returned to Shejaia after 15 days. You can see the destruction. They spared nothing, even trees, there was a lot of greenery in this area. What is the guilt of stones and trees? And what is my guilt as a civilian?” resident Hatem Tayeh told Reuters in the ruins.“There are bodies of civilian people. What is the guilt of the civilian? Who are you fighting?”Israel launched its assault on the Gaza Strip last year after Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and capturing more than 250 hostages according to Israeli tallies.Since then, Israel’s assault has killed more than 38,000 according to medical authorities in Gaza.At the southern edge of the enclave in Rafah near the border with Egypt, where tanks have been operating in most of the city since May, residents said the army continued to blow up houses in the western and central areas, amid fighting with Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and other smaller factions.Palestinian health officials said four people were killed, including a child, in an Israeli air strike in Tel Al-Sultan in western Rafah.The Israeli military said earlier on Thursday around five rockets fired from the Rafah area were successfully intercepted.The negotiations in Qatar and Egypt follow important concessions last week from Hamas, which agreed that a truce could begin and some hostages released without Israel first agreeing to end the war.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who faces opposition within his right-wing cabinet to any deal that would halt the war until Hamas is vanquished, says a deal must allow Israel to resume fighting until it meets all its objectives.Two Hamas officials contacted by Reuters had no immediate comment on the content of the ongoing talks, led by Egypt, Qatar, and the United States.“There will be a meeting today between Hamas and the mediators to check on what responses they have received from the occupation,” said one Palestinian official close to the mediation, without elaboration. \nUS President Biden welcomed UK Prime Minister Starmer's desire for closer ties with Europe, discussed conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza, and emphasized the importance of unity in addressing global challenges.\nNepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) \nBharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality’s ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via ‘tallo bato’—backdoor route—and that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal. \nGyanumaya BK had been suffering from severe backaches for a while. The resident of Pokhara-15, BK visited the Metrocity Hospital in Srijanachowk seeking treatment five months ago. The 69-year-old, who works as a labourer, has already spent over Rs50,000 on follow-up checkups and medications.BK spent eight days in the hospital in January and has been paying off loans she had taken to pay her bills and for follow-up visits to the hospital. Had BK been aware of the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020, which private hospitals must adhere to, she wouldn’t have had to borrow money to pay her medical bills. As per the regulations, hospitals must set aside 10 percent of their total beds to the underprivileged and needy.“I didn’t know hospitals were required to provide free treatment to those who can’t afford hospital stays,” BK said. “But even if I did, I would have to fight to get the service as the hospital won’t willingly offer me the service.”The Pokhara-based 50-bed hospital’s Chief Executive Officer Gyan Prasad Aryal admits that his hospital does not adhere to the mandate. “We don’t have explicit information from the health ministry on the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020,” said Aryal. “Moving forward, we will follow the instructions.” The hospital authorities say they give a 10-15 percent discount on the final hospital bill as opposed to dedicating 10 percent of their beds and free treatment and medications to the less privileged. Hospitals with 15 beds come under the jurisdiction of the local units while those with up to 50 beds fall under the ambit of the Provincial Health Directorate. Likewise, the Provincial Health Ministry oversees health facilities with over 50 beds.However, no regulatory body has data on whether health facilities are following government rules, especially Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. But it is an open secret that most private hospitals in Pokhara are not following the regulations.Pokhara Municipality Health Department Officer Yadunath Baral, Kaski District Health Officer Bhim Prasad Poudel, and Province Health Director Khim Bahadur Khadka all admit that local hospitals disregard the regulations. “Our monitoring and inspection is also lax, that’s why most hospitals ignore the rules,” he said. He says lack of manpower hampers effective inspection. “Our manpower is enough to conduct inspections in other districts, but not in Kaski, which has many private hospitals,” he said. “We need more people for that”. According to Baral, although the hospitals claim to offer a certain discount on final bills to the needy, they are unable to show the record of the discounts provided. “The hospitals claim they give discounts, but most hospitals have not even been able to show us the proof,” said Khadka. “Legal actions should be taken against the hospitals that fail to submit a monthly report on the free services for the poor. More importantly, they must be liable for flouting government standards that aim to benefit the poor.” The Provincial Health Directorate also does not have any data on the directive’s implementation at hospitals with more than 50 beds.The department’s chief of health services Dr Ramesh KC says that they have been working on updating information of health services in the Gandaki region. “Hospitals have failed to submit their mandatory monthly reports. We will seek that information when they come for new permits or permit renewal,” KC said. There are 27 privately-owned hospitals within the Pokhara Metropolitan City and 39 in the Gandaki region. Bharatpur Metropolitan City in Chitwan in Bagmati Province is also called the ‘medical city’  as it is home to 23 private hospitals with a total of 1,200 beds. Additionally, there are multiple large-scale government hospitals and two medical colleges—Chitwan Medical College and College of Medical Sciences—that also provide medical services. Had the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020 been followed by the 23 private hospitals, 120 patients would have received free health services every year, according to Durgadutta Chapagain, chief of the Chitwan Health Office.“Although the hospitals claim they provide the services, none have been able to provide convincing proof. Instead, we found them giving such discounts to patients who are close to hospital operators,” said Chapagain. “Our department validates the permits for new health facilities and re-registrations for hospitals with a 25-bed capacity. We have asked such public health service providers to put up posters or stickers reading ‘Discounts for the needy’ on the hospital premises so that patients know what services they can get on discount.”Meanwhile, Bikram Adhikari, Secretary of the Private Hospitals Coordination Committee in Chitwan, claims that the regulations are impractical. “There are a few services that hospitals can provide free of cost. You cannot expect hospitals to provide all services for free. That’s why there is a need to amend the existing regulations,” said Adhikari.The monitoring bodies’ inaction and lackadaisical approach to ensuring that public health services are accessible and affordable to all makes private hospitals blatantly ignore government mandates.Bharatpur Metropolitan City’s Deputy Mayor Chitrasen Adhikari says that although the metropolis is aware that private hospitals must allocate 10 percent of their beds for free treatment of poor people, the metropolis administration has yet to devise a monitoring mechanism. “We have not taken any steps towards that end, but we will soon,” he said.Just like Pokhara and Chitwan, Biratnagar is also plagued with the same problem. There are 32 private hospitals currently in operation in the metropolis. Deepak Bhattarai, statistical officer at the municipality’s health office, asserts that none of the health facilities met the set requirements. A monthly report submitted by the Biratnagar-based Nobel Medical College and Teaching Hospital, which has 750 beds, stated that the hospital had provided the said concession to more than 400 patients. “However, the report did not clarify how many of the 400 patients were provided free hospital beds and the services that come along with the beds, and how many were given discounts on their hospital bills,” Bhattarai said. “We found that hospital reports also include concessions provided to patients who sought outpatient, emergency, and X-ray services.”The hospital’s director Narayan Dahal claims to be following all government instructions. He says 10 percent hospital beds are set aside for needy patients who are not charged any treatment fees, while 10 percent of service seekers also get discounts.Although the Biratnagar Metropolis has directed all health facilities under its jurisdiction to allocate free beds and provide free services to the needy, inform service seekers about the government-provided services, and submit a list of all patients who have received the services, the directive is ignored more often than followed. According to Bhattarai, medical establishments must get a letter from the local unit before making any upgrades or purchasing any equipment. “But the hospitals have been found presenting fake documents in order to acquire such permits,” he said. “The metropolis has refused such permits to 12 private hospitals in the current fiscal year.”Butwal Sub-Metropolitan City in the Lumbini Province has also taken no concrete step to ensure private hospitals adhere to Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. Despite having the authority to carry out inspections, the sub-metropolis’ apathy has deprived hundreds of needy patients of various government services. The sub-metropolis with 17 wards has more than two dozen big hospitals in the Butwal bazaar area itself. Not one of them adheres to the government’s health regulations. But the sub-metropolis is yet to monitor these hospitals. Yubraj Pandey, chief of Butwal Sub Metropolitan’s health department, says they have been unable to inspect medical institutes due to a lack of a proper set of rules.“I have just been transferred here. Discussions are underway to prepare legal requirements,” he said. Private hospitals in Butwal only began filing their reports two months ago after a joint meeting, informs Chief of the Sub Metropolitan’s Education and Health Department Mitramani Khanal. Twenty-year-old Suraj BK of Sarawal Rural Municipality-2 in West Nawalparasi got into a motorcycle accident on April 26. He suffered injuries on both his legs and was taken to Zenus Hospital and Research Centre in Butwal. Suraj was handed a bill of Rs 70,000 for treatment but he did not have the money to clear the bill and sought the hospital’s help. “The hospital refused to provide any discount. They in fact refused to discharge me. I got my discharge papers only four days later after I paid almost Rs 100,000,” he said. “I had to get a loan to pay the hospital bills as my father, who is a farmer, did not have that kind of money.”Dr Sharda Singh, the hospital director, said Suraj did not qualify for a discount as he did not have a recommendation letter from the local unit. “Patients have to get a recommendation to avail of free services at private hospitals but Suraj could not bring one,” she said. “I was in the hospital bed for four days. I could not have secured a recommendation from the local unit in that state,” said Suraj. Ishwari Prasad Chapagain, a civil society leader of Rupandehi and a member of the Consumer Interest Protection Forum, says private hospitals in Butwal are more interested in making money than helping those in need. “They do not follow government mandates. They act as if they have to bear the expenses of providing free service to the poor when in fact they get tax rebates and such for such services,” he said. “The sub-metropolis also does not do the needful. Everyone is corrupt including the city officials.”  \nThe one lesson Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal seems to have forgotten even as he indulged in all manners of chicanery and machinations to stay in power was the simplest—two can play the same game. In his case, it was actually three but the end result was the same. For a public long wearied of his constant restlessness and the promise of even more instability, the universal reaction to the Oli-Deuba gang up against Dahal was either studied indifference or a feeling that justice has been served.To now be known as the ‘Duplicitous One’ is a big step down from the ‘Fierce One’, the translation of his nom de guerre most commonly used in the heady days when Dahal had just entered mainstream politics. And rather than admit that he had been beaten at his own game, the prime minister has been on a whine, even singing a song about betrayal in love. Most of all, though, warning yet again that regressive forces were becoming active.No record to whine aboutOne just wonders if Dahal(and his minions) now going to town about how the incoming alliance will take the country backward even pause to consider his own record. From engaging in mindless politicking to donning the daura-suruwal to complete his metamorphosis from revolutionary leader to an ordinary politician, what has he done to advance the cause of progressivism that is substantially different from other governments?Since the issue of ‘inclusion’ is one that the Maoists, somewhat justifiably, can be proprietorial over, let us take the case of the different constitutional commissions aimed specifically at furthering that objective. Under ‘Other Commissions’, the 2015 Constitution has provisioned for the National Women Commission, the National Dalit Commission, and the National Inclusion Commission. Following these three are the Adibasi Janajati Commission, the Madheshi Commission, the Tharu Commission, and the Muslim Commission.Why the latter four were not designated as ‘national’ beats reason as does why Tharus were granted a separate commission since, by law, Tharus are also part of the larger Adibasi Janajati grouping. Equally so, why there was no indication of what these ‘non-national’ commissions were to do. Grafted as they were into the draft of the constitution in the wake of the horrific Tikapur incident of August 2015, the political parties were in such a great hurry to assuage those with serious misgivings with the draft constitution that they simply declared that there shall be such-and-such commissions and left it at that. Granted, the Maoists did not have much bargaining heft back in 2015. But they could at least have called for a more comprehensive copy-and-paste job with regard to these commissions. Not that it would have mattered one whit since, over time, all the commissions, ‘national’ or otherwise, have been given nearly the same reduced responsibilities as well as shrinking authority. And, the Maoists have played along without demur. To top it off, even though Dahal has headed the government for the past year and a half, the resource crunch in these commissions, both human and financial, remained wholly unaddressed. These commissions will all be facing an existential threat next year since a review is a constitutional requirement. With barely anything to show over the years, it should come as no surprise if the commissions were written out of the constitution. But it is more likely that the Maoists and other parties will follow the politically expedient path of letting them toothlessly exist as they are.Three ole menHaving said that, we do wonder what kind of political system we live under. All the goings and comings among and between the three major parties, the Nepali Congress, the UML and the Maoists, can hardly be called that. For it was not engagement among parties but just individuals. It is absolutely amazing that for each party, the president alone can decide the way forward. And the office-bearers elected and nominated are then left scrambling for post-facto justifications of their leader’s actions they mostly had no inkling about.Hence, Sher Bahadur Deuba felt no need to take into confidence the party leadership when he decided to back away from the pre-poll understanding with Dahal on who would first lead the government back in 2022. Neither did KP Sharma Oli feel the need to explain to his cadre why he preferred a, b or c as the presidential candidate over x, y and z. Dahal being the self-styled disruptor and heading a party new to democratic politics, obviously would not deign to take anyone’s advice for anything. He now finds no one but himself to blame for the unsavoury situation he has led his party into. The tragedy is that the entire country is being held hostage to the whims of these three men and is likely to be so well into the future.Country doing fineThese men’s efforts to hold back Nepal notwithstanding, we seem to be doing somewhat fine. As mentioned in an earlier piece, national poverty rates have shrunk despite the political dysfunction of the past decade. By one reckoning of the World Bank, measured against the ‘International Poverty Line’ of a per capita income of USD 2.15 per day, poverty has made an exit from Nepal. We will let the economists quibble over these numbers but the fact remains that in spite of the politics, the country is not doing so badly.I would even argue that our democratic space remains open precisely because of the unstable politics we complain so much about. It cannot be just the role of the national character or other such attributes that Nepal is the most open in the region. Just look at the neighbourhood. Each country is in the grip of either a strongman (India, and, till recently, Sri Lanka), or a strongwoman (Bangladesh), or an undemocratic institution (Afghanistan, Myanmar and Pakistan). Our man Oli did try to pull a stunt a la Erdoğan/Orbán/Modi on us when he headed the most powerful government in Nepal’s modern history. But his ambition was cut short by, at times, the force of civil society opposition and, at others, an alert judiciary. We do not know if Oli has tempered his autocratic instincts since. Coalition politics will certainly keep them at abeyance for now. Until the next election, that is. The real test of his and of other leaders will be if they were to lead their party into an emphatic victory. Will we then follow the path of so many other countries of sliding into some form of electoral autocracy? Or will our civil and political institutions be strong enough to withstand any such attempt to undermine them? I am betting on the latter and hoping against hope that I am right. \nAs Iran’s President-elect, Masoud Pezeshkian, continues to receive congratulatory calls from global leaders, he is due to hold discussions with foreign counterparts from July 8, with a swearing-in before the Parliament not scheduled before the first week of August. This does not seem to prevent senior Iranian diplomats from supporting Pezeshkian’s policies (from engaging the West to Afghan refugees, which was a focal point of discussion during the elections). That said, it remains unclear as to how the conservative political regime will respond to his policies, with one scholar referring to over two interactions with the Ayatollah, speculating Pezeshkian to have received some directions/guidance on the same. On enquiring over Pezeshkian’s interaction with the Ayatollah, one IRGC commander acknowledged Pezeshkian received direction to continue the foreign policy initiatives of his predecessor, the late former president Ebrahim Raisi, without naming the Ayatollah. It may be too early to predict the potential prospect of Pezeshkian’s Middle East policy or future efforts to renew Iran-West diplomacy with a neighbouring Taliban, but we witness some excitement within the Rahbari Shura, with members enthusiastically watching this political transition.Afghan migration post-Taliban ruleAs the third year of Taliban rule comes to a close, Afghans continue to apply—in large numbers—for migration to Iran, a pattern which appears to have grown since 2021. According to a source close to Khalil Haqqani (the acting Minister of Refugees), citizens (by hundreds) continue to stand in line outside the Ministry of Refugee and Repatriation in Kabul, seeking permission to leave the country.With the Islamic Republic of Iran topping the list of countries hosting Afghan refugees since the Taliban rule, Iran’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Ambassador Amir Saeed Iravani, during a Security Council session on June 21, reflected the reality. He stated that Iran has hosted over 6 million Afghan refugees till date. In what appeared to be a call for global support on the fate of Afghan Refugees, he argued that the Afghan refugees cost over $10 billion annually for sanctioned-struck Iran. With economic challenges and sanctions drastically sinking Iran’s economy, this amount may be phenomenal, with thousands of Afghan refugees waiting to flee.Tehran’s approach to Afghan refugeesThe fate of Afghan refugees in Iran and Tehran’s approach to resolving the refugee crisis may appear to be pertinent as questions, but they receive occasional responses from Tehran. The future of millions of Afghans living in despicable conditions throughout Iran raises questions on the sheer absence of housing, medical care, education, reunification of families (living within various camps), citizenship, access to bank accounts, or right to work, among other basic facilities, in the background of sheer ambiguous occasional responses from the Tehranian political class. To the Iranian public, the presence of Afghan migrants living in Tehran is a significant cause of concern, as expressed roughly by every scholar we interviewed. Unlike nations with dedicated migration frameworks/programmes/initiatives formulated by state humanitarian entities, Iran lacks a migration policy. This reflects local Iranians’ sentiment towards Afghan migrants, forcing Tehran to maintain some distance from the issue, creating a policy vacuum. Devoid of social interaction/societal integration, the Afghan migrants continue to be viewed with great suspicion, forcing local authorities to deny them even basic amenities and access to decent living.A hope from Pezeshkian?In many economies, migrant/refugee policies have always found their way through the electoral process. They did so, even in Iran’s conservative political system, with presidential candidates arguing on the issue of migrants. During the presidential race, Mohammad Ghalibaf and Pezeshkian emphasised the need to seriously address the Afghan refugee issue, at least in their campaign, garnering greater interaction/engagement over the problem. However, it remains ignored and occasionally answered by Tehran when asked by South Asian/Western scholars.Reflecting on Pezeshkian’s presidential campaign, we decided to predict that President-elect Pezeshkian's refugee policy—which remains unclear due to the Ayatollah’s constant guidance (according to one scholar)—may vary from closing the eastern borders with Afghanistan and Pakistan to mass deportation of refugees to a dedicated refugee agreement with the Taliban government or creating a dedicated Afghan refugee policy without alienating the Taliban. Those close to Pezeshkian reflected some positive outcomes to the Afghan refugee issue since “the President-elect aims to formulate a multi-dimensional approach to counter illegal foreign nationals”, according to a source who advises him on migrant issues.According to a Tehran-based scholar, Pezeshkian may call for a complete border closure, taking a harsher stand on migration in the first few weeks of his presidency. Although the President-elect discussed the challenges to migration and the influx of refugees (in Europe) with European leaders, it is highly likely for him to request that EU leaders accept some refugees if the Israeli hostage negotiations between the US and Hamas conclude successfully. It would not be incorrect to credit Pezeshkian on his positive reflection towards Afghan refugees, which, according to him, would play a positive/progressive role in Iran’s development, terming their contribution as constructive to the country’s growth.With the elections over and Pezeshkian yet to take office, the issue of Afghan refugees (which took precedence during his election campaign) may take a back seat, at least until August.A dedicated Afghan refugee policy?Without a doubt, the President-elect aims to govern refugees, and he understands the challenges of shutting down the border. Unlike his counterpart, he has drawn lessons from Trump’s Mexico Wall or the stricter stance of right-wing policymakers in Europe. It remains unclear whether his government would formulate a dedicated refugee policy (even one dedicated to Afghan refugees), carrying the risk of alienating either his voters, regime loyalists, Ayatollah himself or the Taliban.Pezeshkian’s first few months of the presidency will focus on the Gaza War, sanctioned hit economy, increasing unemployment and depleting workforce, not on the Afghan refugee crisis. Nonetheless, he could initiate policies and programmes to integrate Afghan refugees into a constructive role in Iran. The argument of a refugee policy/migrant reform dedicated to Afghan refugees appears far-fetched, but the President-elect may allow them to contribute to Iran’s economic development and infrastructural growth and also guarantee better housing, healthcare and access to better living.That said, decisions about the fate of Afghan refugees are made at levels higher than the legislative branch (executive under the guidance of the Supreme Leader), which the President-elect Pezeshkian cannot substantially change even as a policy. Though he may bring minor alterations in such a scenario, a fundamental change is but ideal. \nThe 2015 Constitution marked a significant milestone in Nepal’s political history. Its formal implementation began with the election of the three levels of government—federal, provincial and local—in 2017. As Nepal enters a new phase of its political evolution, it is an opportune moment to consider necessary amendments to the constitution to strengthen federalism and democracy. The Post also published an editorial titled 'Easy does it' this Monday, highlighting the complexities involved in this process. The Nepali Congress and the Communist Party of Nepal (UML), the two major political parties, claim to have agreed to amend the constitution. If so, this is a positive step toward addressing critical governance issues. However, alliances and agreements between these major parties are precarious and prone to change, threatening political stability. There are talks of forming a national consensus government and amending the constitution, but the possibility and impact of such an endeavour remain questionable.Nine years after its promulgation, the constitution’s shortcomings and inconsistencies have become evident. A severe review of the constitution's implementation is necessary, and reforms and amendments must address these issues. The constitution should be seen as a dynamic and living document, not merely a source of problems. This approach emphasises continuous improvement to reflect the evolving political and social environment.A good constitution alone does not ensure good governance; it requires competent, sincere and committed leaders. The constitution issued by the Constituent Assembly is certainly an improvement over previous versions, but its implementation has been slow. Provincial and local governments have struggled to exercise the rights granted by the constitution. For instance, the constitution assigns provinces the exclusive right to exercise police powers, but this has not been allowed in practice.Frequent changes in power have caused dissatisfaction among citizens. While the United States has maintained the same federal constitution and governance system for over two centuries, Switzerland has had the same federal system for 176 years, Canada for 157 years, and India for 74 years. These countries have undergone repeated constitutional reforms to ensure stability. In contrast, Nepal has seen numerous changes in its governance system and constitution.Federalism is the cornerstone of Nepal's constitution. The issue lies not in the constitution itself but in its implementation by the rulers. Instead of addressing constitutional loopholes, leaders have exacerbated them. Reforms in the electoral system are essential to achieving stability and a better federal governance system. Nepal’s mixed electoral system has led to coalition governments. While some people lament that small parties play disproportional roles in the coalition culture, a coalition of diverse parties can also bring more comprehensive ideas and solutions for the country’s development. However, individual interests have often taken precedence over national interests, leading to a lack of collective accountability. Therefore, reform of the electoral system is inevitable.A significant debate revolves around whether to reduce the seats allocated for proportional representation in the House of Representatives. The proportional representation system was designed to ensure fair representation for women, Dalits and marginalised communities. Removing this system altogether, or even reducing its weightage, without addressing the underlying issues of representation, would be inappropriate and counterproductive. The fault lies not in the electoral system but in the political leadership that constantly changes alliances.Some politicians and analysts have proposed direct election of the Prime Minister and Chief Minister, which could lead to more stable governments. This change would require making parliamentary elections entirely proportional, ensuring that MPs focus on law-making and government oversight. They also propose reforming the structure of the provinces, as the current federal system does not appear to function effectively. Reducing the number of Members of Parliament (MPs) is necessary. The House of Representatives (HoR) currently has 275 seats, and the Provincial Assemblies together have 550 seats. The large size of the HoR and the provincial assemblies has resulted in huge expenses. The first-past-the-post (FPTP) voting system should ensure that everyone is directly elected, and the number of MPs should be adjusted accordingly. Reducing the number of MPs elected through the proportional electoral system—currently 110 in the HoR and 220 in the provincial assemblies—will also address the high costs associated with federalism. However, in the FPTP system, those elected via the proportional electoral system, such as women, Dalits and other marginalised communities, should be addressed with reserved constituencies. In such cases, elections should be held exclusively within these groups.The proportional electoral system is not inherently flawed. However, it has often benefited those with political connections or financial influence. To address this, proportional candidates should be elected based on joint votes from political parties and candidates, ensuring the people approve them. Amendments should include fixing the tenure of the Prime Minister, similar to the President and local level heads, who have two tenures. The PM should not serve more than two terms. Limiting MPs from becoming ministers can also reduce political corruption. Reducing the number of ministers is crucial; the current provision for up to 25 ministers is excessive. With the provincial and local levels taking more responsibilities, the number of ministries at the federal level should be reduced by half.Nepal's federal system must also streamline the number of departments and ministries. Many existing departments play insignificant roles and should be abolished or transferred to provinces. Stability at the provincial level is another critical issue. Frequent changes of Chief Ministers have led to public discontent. Direct elections for Chief Ministers can enhance accountability and stability. The constitution should be amended to allow the Vice President to become the Chairperson of the National Assembly. This will reduce additional expenses and enhance the role and effectiveness of the National Assembly.Amending the constitution requires a two-thirds majority in both houses of Parliament, which the Congress and the UML alone cannot achieve. Forming a national consensus government is necessary to garner the required support. However, significant contradictions among the parties on constitutional issues make it challenging to reach a consensus. These contradictions need to be addressed through dialogue and compromise to move forward effectively.The constitution outlines formal roles and duties and expects certain behaviour from political and institutional actors. Political parties, leadership, parliament, judiciary and constitutional bodies must establish actions aligned with the constitution's essence. Without this alignment, politics cannot gain people’s trust, and the Constitution becomes merely a tool for gaining power.Judicial reforms are also crucial for constitutional stability. The constitution must be amended to address these issues comprehensively. Disillusionment and mistrust towards political leadership and politics in general are prevalent. This sentiment stems from the opportunism of political leaders rather than the constitution and the system. We need a new generation of leaders who can feel the changing aspirations of society and maintain relevance in politics. Leadership should focus on long-term national interests rather than short-term personal gains.Nepal stands at a crossroads where constitutional amendments can pave the way for a more stable and prosperous future. The collaboration between major political parties and the lessons from international experiences underscore the importance of these reforms. By addressing the current challenges and ensuring proportional inclusive representation, Nepal can strengthen its federalism and democracy, fulfilling the aspirations of its people.Finally, amending the constitution alone will not solve the problems unless it is accompanied by a change in political culture and leaders’ attitudes and actions. Political stability and effectiveness depend on the commitment of political actors to uphold the principles of the constitution and work towards the common good. This holistic approach is essential for ensuring the constitution remains a robust and guiding document for the nation’s future. \nAs much as we love the monsoon for its greenery and promise of a bountiful harvest, we dread floods, landslides and diseases. As in years past, disasters have wreaked havoc in several parts of Nepal this year too, leading to at least 70 deaths since June. Adding to the woes are vector- and water-borne diseases, such as viral fever, diarrhoea, dysentery, food poisoning, typhoid, dengue and kala-azar, turning the season into a time of epidemics. The Epidemiology and Disease Control Division has already warned doctors and the public of possible uptick in incidents of these diseases.In 2022, as a result of contaminated water, Kathmandu Valley saw an outbreak of cholera, with 77 positive cases reported. The same year, diarrheal diseases affected hundreds of people for many months. Just last month, a patient tested positive for the Vibrio cholerae 01 Ogawa serotype at the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital, of which the authorities were reportedly unaware, as per a Post report. This is not a good sign, as many cases usually go unreported because people don’t visit hospitals unless there’s an emergency, and a lack of investigation from the government means no awareness about the possible spread of cholera. Such negligence about a deadly disease will only fuel its spread.Moreover, the dengue outbreak in the country has gone out of hand over the years. According to official records, the virus has circulated to 73 districts, infecting almost 1,500 people since January. What is concerning is that these numbers could go up, as we aren’t even halfway through this monsoon, and the dengue virus lasts until post-monsoon. Additionally, climate change and rising temperatures have pushed the disease even into the winter season. Recently, health experts have also been worried about the possible instances of the Zika virus (similar to dengue) in Nepal, as cases are being detected in the southern neighbour India. The outbreaks of these diseases and their prolonged presence can easily drain the healthcare facilities of an under-resourced country like ours. In the monsoon crisis, the poor and vulnerable suffer the most, as their condition is compounded by contaminated water, floods, landslides, and other monsoon-related disasters. This not only affects their treatment-seeking behaviour but also their ability to adopt preventive measures, which could in turn lead to community-level transmission of diseases.The Epidemic and Outbreak Surveillance of the Ministry of Health is tasked with collecting data on diseases, informing the general public, and encouraging policymakers to take necessary actions against outbreaks and make people aware of them. Moreover, it also regularly monitors drinking water quality and does surveillance of water-borne diseases. In recent months, it has found harmful substances like faecal coliform in bottled water and even tap water in some places in the Kathmandu Valley. These findings suggest the surveillance and monitoring mechanism in the country has to be strengthened, and local units around the country should be made responsible for keeping their water resources safe throughout the year, especially during the monsoon, to prevent possible outbreaks of water-borne diseases. In the case of vector-borne dengue, Zika and chikungunya viruses, a year-round door-to-door search and destruction of mosquito breeding areas is a must.Nepal has been dealing with monsoon maladies for decades. Our healthcare system should proactively allocate human, infrastructural and budgetary resources to combat these monsoon epidemics and prevent unnecessary loss of life and a whole lot of suffering.  \nThe monsoon has been causing havoc right across Nepal in the past couple of days. At least 70 people have been killed in floods, landslides and other monsoon-related disasters since June 10, according to the Nepal Police. Five others were missing and 86 people were injured in water-induced disasters over a month. There must have been many other incidents not included in official records. The monsoon entered Nepal from its eastern part in the second week of June. Heavy rainfalls that caused huge damage in Bagmati, Gandaki and Lumbini provinces until Sunday, wreaked havoc in far-western Nepal on Monday.As a country with over 83 percent of its land covered by hills and mountains, Nepal is always at the risk of landslides and floods mainly in the monsoon period. Similarly, people in the southern belt are tormented by inundation. Monsoon-related disasters are a yearly occurrence. The Monsoon Preparedness and Response Plan 2024 estimated that over 412,000 households may be affected and of them over 83,000 are likely to be badly hit by monsoon-related disasters this season. In a decade between April 2014 to April 2024, there were 1,602 recorded floods and 2,840 landslides. At least 3,052 people were killed, 791 went missing and 4,176 were injured in the period, according to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority. Similarly, 16,054 buildings and other structures were damaged. This shows the magnitude of the losses caused by monsoon-related disasters in the country.As heavy rains have battered almost all parts of the country, a large number of people have been struggling to deal with the disasters. Besides deaths, missing and injuries, thousands have been displaced and taking shelter in nearby places. In such times, saving lives by rescuing people trapped in difficult situations should be the government’s first priority. Logically, what follows is shifting people from disaster-prone areas to safer places, swiftly distributing reliefs and working on a plan to rehabilitate the displaced. Though our three security agencies often do a commendable job of saving people’s lives, they are still not well-equipped. Just months ago, some of them died while trying to contain wildfires. Rescuers should be equipped with better gears and other logistics before they set out on rescue missions. Moreover, relief distribution and rehabilitation works often court controversy either because of substandard quality of the goods distributed, or the irregularities while carrying out the task.When it comes to rehabilitating flood victims, our state agencies have utterly failed. Thousands of people have been languishing in either nearby forest areas, on riverbanks or other unsafe places for years where they had supposedly been shifted for a few months. For instance, floods in Koshi in August 2008 displaced 7,563 families from the present-day Shreepur, Haripur, and West Kushaha, located across different wards of Koshi Rural Municipality. But they are still living in makeshift huts and mud houses as the government has failed to properly rehabilitate them in the past 16 years. The Koshi Flood Victims Struggle Committee is fighting for their basic rights. A state that cannot ensure the basic safety of its citizens, we are afraid, has gotten its priorities badly wrong.    \nThe text of the midnight deal last Monday whereby the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML agreed to stitch together a new coalition remains hidden, giving rise to much speculation. Yet while talking about the deal, the leaders of the two parties have pointed to the necessity of a ‘national consensus’ government in order to address the country’s pressing problems. This, they say, entails amending the nine-year-old national constitution. Even if the country’s two largest parties come together, they will fall short of a two-thirds majority needed to amend the constitution in the federal lower House. Had they the numbers in the lower chamber, they would have fallen short in the upper House. To amend the constitution, the ruling parties ought to have two-thirds majority in both. This is why many analysts reckon the constitution amendment is no more than an excuse to justify the toppling of the Pushpa Kamal Dahal government. That is unfortunate. The biggest architects of the national charter cannot be so cavalier when it comes to its amendment.The other suspicion is that in pushing for constitution amendment, the two big parties want to significantly reduce the number of proportional representation seats in the two Houses. The reasoning is that the PR seats have allowed many smaller political outfits to enter parliament and to bargain for power with the big parties, thus contributing to political instability. The Congress and the UML also seemingly want to capitalise on the perception that the PR seats are mostly reserved for those close to powerful party chairs rather than for members of the marginalised and under-represented communities, as was envisioned in the constitution. Whatever the case, they should tread carefully. Despite all its flaws, the PR system has significantly increased the political representation of marginalised communities and groups and it would be dangerous to fiddle with it without their buy-in. There is also no guarantee a fully FPTP system will ensure stability. Even before the new constitution came into effect in 2015, not a single government, each one of them formed through direct elections, came close to serving out its full term. This again points to the need for broad consultations—and not a little introspection on the part of our top leaders. A living document that is the constitution can and should be amended on a timely basis, or it becomes irrelevant. But hastily tweaking it could invite more problems than it would solve. It is interesting that many of the high-ranking Congress and UML leaders were unaware of the Monday deal even an hour before it was signed. It is thus hard to believe that the points of agreement were much discussed even inside the two parties, much less in the broader society. For far too long, the leaders of the big parties have treated the apparatus of government pretty much as their personal property. The biggest reason the new federal republican system has not functioned as intended is their sense of entitlement, lack of accountability, and paucity of faith in the system they have themselves championed in public. Unless there is a change in this mindset, no system of governance or election will yield the desired results.  \nThe Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML last week reached an agreement to form a coalition government under the leadership of UML chair KP Sharma Oli. As a part of the package, they also aim to make certain changes to the constitution. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asked Pradeep Gyawali, deputy general secretary of UML, the reasons behind the coming together of the two largest parties, how they plan to run the government and to review and amend the constitution.Many are seeing the Congress-UML alliance as something unusual. What factors brought the two largest parties together even as there is no crisis-like situation or a special task such as constitution writing?Definitely, in normal parliamentary practice, the two largest parties don’t forge an alliance to run a government. The party that gets the biggest mandate leads the government, and the other big party remains in the opposition to make the ruling force accountable. In Nepal, the country’s two major forces, the Congress and the UML, have also joined hands in certain junctures for certain purposes. They worked together to make the constitution in 1990, to conduct general elections in 1999, to complete transition after the 2006 people’s movement and to bring out the constitution in 2015. We felt a need for a similar collaboration this time around. After the November 2022 elections, we saw three alliances in our parliament. At first, Maoist Centre chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal became prime minister with our support, but he failed to abide by the agreement sincerely. He changed the coalition within a month. The subsequent alliance between the Congress and the Maoist Centre lasted for a year. He again sought the UML’s support. Within four months of the March 4 deal with the UML, he started yet another gameplan to join hands with the Congress under the pretext of forming a national consensus government. It was quite unusual for the prime minister himself to instigate instability in the government. He publicly boasted that he had a ‘magical number’ [32 seats in the House of Representatives]. He thought that he could employ the tactic of ‘use and throw’ with the two largest parties and rule the country for the full term. He was completely indifferent to people’s plight, the country’s pressing issues and service delivery. This was the height of irresponsibility. So, the UML and Congress leaders concluded that the time had come to intervene to ensure political stability and service delivery and make sure public frustration doesn’t get out of hand. Did external factors play a role? Recent statements by UML leaders suggest that the party has taken it seriously. When national forces are weak, the neighbouring countries and international forces become more cautious, even more so given Nepal’s geo-political situation. Some of their concerns are valid. They fear political instability in Nepal may have an adverse impact on their genuine issues. We have to take this naturally. Second, it is no secret that we have a long legacy of facing external interference. Sometimes such interventions are carried out covertly and sometimes overtly. Therefore, national forces should be strong. Some political parties and leaders have a tendency of seeking external forces’ support to fulfil their vested interests. In return, they serve the external forces’ undue interests. Formation of a government is a purely domestic affair, but in our case sometimes it also becomes an issue of geopolitical interest. It is said that the UML was spooked when it learned that Prime Minister Dahal had reportedly approached the Congress for a new alliance. This reportedly happened after Dahal returned from New Delhi following Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s swearing-in.We were taken by surprise when the Congress leaders told us that the prime minister had reached out to them with a proposal to form a national consensus government. We were informed about the development from the leaders of the main opposition party. When we reached the March 4 deal with the prime minister, we thought he came to us with a commitment to course correction. Based on that, we supported him almost unconditionally. We didn’t bargain while sharing ministerial portfolios and didn’t talk about the prime minister’s term. We had even thought of allowing Dahal to run the government for the full term if the government functioned well and people were satisfied. We hadn’t even imagined that we would have to think about changing the coalition within four months.We definitely had certain grievances such as a lack of consultation with our party and our lawmakers while preparing the government’s policies and programmes and while allocating budget. Our party chair brought up this issue with the prime minister. But our concerns weren’t addressed. They had already started to ignore us. There were several issues with the prime minister, but we were committed to the partnership. But they had already gone too far. Fortunately, the Congress leaders didn’t accept the offer and instead raised critical questions about the rationale behind the proposal. Basically, the Congress didn’t trust Prachanda ji [Dahal] and came to us. It concluded that Dahal didn’t come with the intent of solving the country’s problems but to manoeuvre between the Congress and the UML.Besides jointly running the government, constitution amendment is another major aspect of the latest Congress-UML deal. What are the provisions the parties want to change?There are four major objectives of this agreement. Safeguarding national interest; strengthening economy; improving governance and service delivery; and ensuring political stability. A debate has started that some constitutional provisions are not helping maintain political stability. What we have said is that it’s been almost a decade since the promulgation of this constitution. Some of its provisions are yet to be implemented. On the other hand, provincial governments complain that they have not been able to work in a full-fledged way because the federal government has still not made some laws they need. So, first, we will undertake a comprehensive review on the progress in the course of implementing the constitution and the challenges we faced in the past decade, among other things. While doing so, we will find out if there are provisions that have posed challenges in maintaining political stability and running a stable government and suggest amendments accordingly.So, it’s not only about the amendment but also about review, assessment and recommendation for amendment, if there is a need. Even if the amendment process begins, it will be limited to ensuring political stability and won’t touch other aspects of the statute. There is no need to over-react. For instance, some Maoist leaders are trying to make it a political issue by describing it as a regressive move. That is wrong.So as per the two-party deal, the statute will be reviewed but not necessarily amended?Yes, whether to go for amendments will depend on the findings of the review. No constitution in the world is perfect. Its success largely depends on the practitioners. So, first we have to differentiate between the role of the constitution and the practitioners. It is true that our society is divided over certain provisions of our constitution. All these issues will be considered, but the fundamental features of the constitution such as democracy, inclusion and federalism won’t be altered. Our priority would be to only remove hindrances in making the system more functional, people-oriented and productive.Of late, people are debating the electoral system, provincial structure and secularism. Will these issues also be dealt with?Federalism is a new system for us. In fact, it is still an in-the-making process in Nepal. We have to note some timelines while analysing the performance of provinces. After the provincial and federal elections in 2017, the first provincial governments were formed in 2018, and they worked for around three years in a stable way. With small cabinets, they worked genuinely to strengthen the provincial system. At the time, most provincial cabinets had around six to seven ministers. They weren’t severely criticised at the time. The wrong trends in the provinces started with the division of the then Nepal Communist Party and the fall of the NCP-led governments at the centre as well as provinces. We saw the trend of horse-trading in provinces. Small parties made unjustified bargaining for ministerial portfolios, chief ministers started splitting ministries and increasing the number of ministers in their cabinets. Also, the November 2022 polls again gave a fragmented verdict, further augmenting the instability and anomalies at the provincial level. So, the problem is the way we are handling things more than the provincial structures. The time isn’t ripe to seek an alternative to the provinces. As far as the electoral model is concerned, we included proportional electoral (PR) system after long debates and discussions. Based on three general elections held after 1990, a conclusion was drawn that the first-past-the-post (FPTP) model couldn’t properly represent the historically under-represented sections. The premise is still valid. Based on the achievements, we may exclude certain communities from the list. But that time hasn’t come. Two questions raised over the use of PR are valid. Is the system really doing justice to the strata and class of the society for which it was introduced? This is the question not about the PR system but the leaders who use it. Similarly, some questions: Is proportional representation required in executive as well because representation is basically vital for policy making? The forms and modalities of the PR system might be discussed, but no one has even thought of removing the inclusive system.Similar is the case with secularism. The spirit is to make the state patron of all religions in the country. However, some sections of society have often tried to misuse and misinterpret the new constitutional provision. They try to interpret secularism as openly allowing rampant religious conversion, and some have made it an excuse to attack the age-old Sanatan faith. For instance, if the President or prime minister visits Lumbini, gurudwara or a shrine of any other faith on certain occasions, that is taken positively, but when they visit Pashupatinath Temple, a section of people raise questions. These activities have made some people think that these attacks on our Sanatan faith are taking place because of the secular system. There is no problem in the constitutional provision because the statute added an explanatory note that states, “‘secular’ means religious, cultural freedoms, including protection of religion and culture handed down from time immemorial.” But some extremist activities have given wrong impressions.Some experts believe the problem of fragmented mandate can be addressed by increasing the threshold required for a political party to be eligible to get PR seats, which can be done by amending laws. Will the Congress-UML alliance opt for this?Yes, this is one feasible option. I am in favour of this. As per the existing provision, a political party can secure seats under the PR category by securing 3 percent votes in the federal parliament and 1.5 percent votes in provincial assemblies. If a political organisation doesn’t even represent 5 or 7 or 10 percent of the population, what can they contribute to the country? You do politics to represent a sizable population and get a public mandate. Otherwise, the presence of such groups would only promote unreasonable bargaining and instigate instability in governments. This can be one of the agenda of the discussion between the two parties.This time, leaders have made it transparent that chiefs of the two parties will lead the government on a rotational basis. But why have other details of the agreement not been made public?There hasn’t been topic-wise discussions on specific provisions. The broader understanding is to review and assess the implementation aspect of the constitution and move ahead based on the findings of the assessment. We have also made it clear that such an act will be guided only by the objective of ensuring political stability and we will not go beyond that. Who will undertake this type of constitution review?We haven’t worked on it in detail. We haven’t reached any understanding. Naturally, inputs will be taken from the constitution makers, experts on constitutional law and politicians involved in this field. But no decision has been made on its nitty-gritty.The Rastriya Prajatantra Party that wants to revive the Hindu kingdom was the first party to welcome the Congress-UML deal while the Maoist Centre has accused Congress and UML of making a regressive move. So don’t you think this affair is tricky?I don’t think the political parties will touch the issues that the RPP talks about, such as reinstatement of Hindu kingdom and dissolution of federalism. No one is thinking about that. Also, the questions raised by the Maoist leaders have no meaning. They are only trying to make a political agenda.It also seems that the Congress and the UML floated this idea of reviewing the constitution to make a case for the two largest parties to form the government.That’s not true. This question undermines the spirit of this agreement. If this system fails, people will raise questions mainly to the leaders of the Congress and the UML, not Prachanda. It’s not only about running the government. We were already in the government and it isn’t a big deal for the Congress to return to power. If democracy fails, the democratic forces will lose the most. So we are genuinely working on this. The Congress and the UML are historical rival forces in Nepali politics. How can the two work together in government?It is true that the Congress and the UML are the two major competitors of this country. But we have some converging factors. First, we both believe in a broader democratic framework. Sometimes, the Congress may give more emphasis on liberal values while we may push for more socialism-oriented programmes. But the common ground is democratic values. We also have the experience of successfully carrying out certain tasks jointly. We may have some friction but we also have experience of managing bitter intra-party fighting as well as inter-party rivalry.How will the ministerial portfolios be shared in the new coalition?We haven’t reached any agreement in detail. As we aim to make this a ‘national consensus government’ we are in favour of accommodating other parties. So it will depend on the number of parties that join the Cabinet. Our only concern is that ministerial allocations should be done in a way that doesn’t weaken the prime minister in order to ensure that the head of the government can deliver.How can a government without the Maoist Centre and some other parties be called a consensus government?We have to wait for that. Leaders of political parties that fiercely criticise the government also join the Cabinet under one or other pretext. Some political parties seemingly cannot exist without being in the government.  \nIn the Secondary Education Examinations (SEE) conducted this year, over 52 percent of students failed to graduate to grade 11. The National Examination Board had enforced the ‘non-graded’ category from this year. The underperformance of the majority of school students has stirred a fresh debate about the test system. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with former National Planning Commission member Usha Jha, who led the committee that recommended the government to adopt the letter grading system.How do you analyse the SEE results published on Thursday?People have reacted to it with shock, not me. In fact, on the basis of the teaching system that is being practised in our schools, I think the results are good. We get the results based on what and how we teach students. Over 52 percent of students have been categorised as non-graded. We need to identify and address the causes behind the bad results. I have heard some people blame the letter grading system. This is wrong. A form of letter grading system was already there. We only suggested an upgraded form of the system. If we start blaming the system, we won’t find the real cause of the problem. What may be the real causes that you are hinting at?The first is the poor quality of teachers in our country. A form of letter grading system was there even before. But it had two loopholes. First, the government took an approach whereby all students would pass. That gave an impression to the students that they don’t need to study hard. That degraded the quality of their education. Second, there was a system of giving marks based on the students’ performances in theoretical and practical exams. Of the total 100 marks, the practical exams made up 35 marks. Most students were given maximum marks in the practical exams. That helped them get higher grades even if they didn’t do well in theoretical exams. This system encouraged students to neglect theoretical studies. That has caused huge damage to our education system. The letter grade system introduced this year has closed those loopholes. But the letter grading system requires a learning environment. The system was introduced without adequate preparation for its effective implementation. Also, the Covid pandemic disturbed preparatory works at the time. We should have drastically improved classroom teaching practices, and trained teachers across the country because their teaching methods are outdated. They weren’t trained on the grading system. They give lectures and encourage students to memorise while the letter grading system requires a thorough process and encourages result-oriented learning. It doesn’t prioritise marks. Our teachers and schools lacked the capacity to implement the new system. Teachers weren’t trained and prepared. Even now, most teachers don’t know what the letter grading system is. The system is necessary to make our students compete in global markets.While we upgraded the system, we didn’t upgrade the schools and teachers. Our teachers engage only in routine and formal responsibilities such as completing textbook courses before the examinations. This system should be properly internalised not only by teachers and students but also school management, palikas [local units] and parents of the students. Only then can it be effectively implemented. These are the major reasons behind the poor results. How is the students’ performance evaluated in the letter grading system?First, teachers should study a lot. They take reference of the subject matter from the textbook and teach students giving a broader perspective of the matter. They have to engage the students practically on the issue. The students should be regularly evaluated based on their participation and response in study and activities. The teachers should teach them and constantly monitor whether they are learning and making progress. The marking should be based on that. So, in this system, the examination starts from day 1 and everyday activities contribute to their marks. It also takes other activities such as behaviour, understanding, presentation into consideration. Therefore, it is called a regular assessment system based on a thorough process, unlike the traditional three-hour-long yearly examination method. If the teachers aren’t competent to carry out these activities, this idea can’t yield good results. They badly need capacity enhancement. The pedagogy should be remodelled.What was the rationale behind the decision to implement this system?One reason was to upgrade our education’s standard on par with the international standards and make our students fit for global markets. In the course of formulating this policy, we undertook a comprehensive research of international practices. Based on that evidence-based research, we submitted a report to then education minister Giriraj Mani Pokharel. The government studied and endorsed it. Basically, this system was introduced with an objective of upgrading our education system in the changed context. But we lacked preparations to implement this idea.We will make a mistake if we change this system. I heard that the education minister [Sumana Shrestha] decided to make some changes in the policy and allow all non-graded students to sit for chance examinations, whereas the system says only those students who secured non-grades in two subjects can retake exams for the same subjects. There is no point in changing the method to favour even the students who have failed in all the subjects. She should have made it clear what factors made her change the criteria overnight. I cannot understand why the minister made the decision in a haste without considering its impact.In fact, our next step should have been capacity enhancement of teachers. The minister took some right decisions such as separating teachers from political parties. But an incumbent minister changing a system that was implemented by a previous minister would cause a problem. She could have formed a panel to conduct a study to find if the letter grading system is the main cause behind the students’ underperformance. But changing a policy through an order didn’t look good.Results show our students are very poor in mathematics, science and English. What could be the reasons?This is unfortunate. We saw similar trends in previous years as well. Mathematics and science are becoming more challenging. One reason is the lack of sufficient teachers for these subjects. Also, some teachers are under-utilised. Some teachers don’t go to the schools. So special measures need to be taken to manage teachers mainly for these subjects. Otherwise, we will have similar results in the coming years.The committee under your leadership recommended that those getting a GPA below 1.6 have to choose technical courses and those willing to study Grade 11 must score above 1.6 GPA. What was the idea behind that recommendation?The idea was to end the situation of halting students’ study and activities because of their lower grades. We have a government body in the form of the Council for Technical Education and Vocational Training (CTEVT) which has been offering dozens of vocational training based on the needs and interests of people. So our youths can join a suitable CTEVT course. We need more people in vocational fields. Skilled people aren’t available in the country. A large number of people working in technical fields in Nepal are from India. We included the provision in consultation with CTEVT officials. Minister Giriraj Mani Pokharel had also prepared a broad plan to implement the letter grading system and integrate the vocational part in our education system. The present government should improve the education system by enhancing teachers’ capacity and encouraging youths to join vocational training to fill the gaps in the employment market. Are the infrastructure and resources available in our education system sufficient to implement the grading system?Some schools lack even essential resources while in some we find misuse or underuse of resources. So, our education ministry should carry out a comprehensive mapping and find where teachers are required, where they are underutilised and where they are idle. Then, the government can make optimum use of the teachers and make additional investment on need-basis. Such an approach will yield better results. In general, our academic institutions lack resources as there is a trend of allocating insufficient budgets for the education sector. Yes, the letter grading system needs more investment. We have to work on teachers’ capacity enhancement and to provide learning materials to students. When you make an activity participatory, you certainly need resources and investments.Do we need to review our teacher recruitment process and our pedagogy in the universities that produce teachers?The government can consider new requirements while recruiting teachers and train them accordingly. Also, we need to update our curriculum and pedagogy for courses such as BEd and MEd to produce quality teachers. I have doubts about the quality of our graduates, post-graduates and even PhD holders due to the poor teaching and learning environment of our academic institutions. There is a need for more coordination and collaboration between the government and universities to address such issues.In the end, I want to stress that the government should adopt a clear and consistent policy and avoid ad-hoc decisions. The letter grading system is the best and we should push for that despite the challenges in its implementation. Just that it should have been enforced after enhancing teachers’ capacity. The problems we have now are due to lack of preparation. \nThe government’s recent decision to recall ambassadors, particularly Nepal’s envoy to India, just ahead of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s visit to New Delhi, courted widespread controversy. What are the takeaways of the prime minister’s Delhi visit? What is the progress in implementing the trade and transit agreement signed with China and with the BRI projects? Thira Lal Bhusal of the Post sat down with Rupak Sapkota, foreign affairs advisor to the prime minister, for some insights.The government’s decision to recall ambassadors from 11 countries at once has come under heavy criticism. Why did the government take such a decision?In general, it has become a practice of sorts to recall incumbent ambassadors and appoint new ones after changes in the government or in the ruling coalition. This has both merits and demerits. The country’s foreign policy doesn’t change with a change in government. But every government and coalition has its specific policies, programmes and priorities. Therefore, even other countries make changes in political appointments as per the government’s priorities. Our case is a bit different. Ruling coalitions are frequently changed, and so are ambassadors. As there is a high chance of our politics being governed by coalitions given our electoral system, it has become necessary to establish a rational system on ambassadorial appointment. Either the political appointees themselves should voluntarily quit the job and return home just like vice-chair and members of the National Planning Commission do. Or there should be a consensus among major political forces to allow our ambassadors to serve out the full term.The second option of allowing ambassadors to serve out their term sounds better, doesn’t it?Definitely. Some initiatives have been taken with the objective of making our diplomatic appointments more prestigious, merit-based and better-managed. The government in 2019 introduced some criteria on ambassadorial appointments. We have to put more effort into ensuring that our ambassadorial appointees have the capacity to effectively carry out diplomatic duties. Once we establish a system of appointing envoys based on merit and not out of political biases, we can create a situation of allowing them to serve for the full term. Then, a change of coalition wouldn’t affect their continuity. We need to develop such a political consensus, given our geopolitical sensitivity.But the ambassadors appointed in recent years and their activities in host countries have lowered the bar of our diplomacy.We have seen rapid and huge changes in power equations in the world. In view of that, we can see some countries have appointed former ministers and even prime ministers as envoys to the countries with whom they have vital relations. They also appoint such personalities as envoys for a special mission. So, we have to think about ambassadorial appointments from different perspectives based on the changed context. It is high time that all the political forces and leaders agree on a basic point that those who have in-depth understanding and expertise of the field and can work for the best interest of the country will be appointed the country’s ambassadors. If the individual is competent, the person’s affiliation to a political party may not be a problem. But whether the person can work in the best interest of the country must be considered before appointment.But the government itself doesn’t seem serious about maintaining diplomatic decorum. For instance, the June 6 Cabinet meeting decided to recall the ambassador from India just days ahead of the prime minister’s New Delhi visit. There were also reports that the prime minister made the decision reluctantly due to pressure from coalition partners. What is the real story?It is nothing more than a coincidence. There were discussions about making changes in the ambassadorial positions in line with the March 4 changes in the ruling coalition. But it was deferred as the government needed to accomplish some important tasks and convene events such as the investment summit. When the government decided to change our ambassadors, it just happened to coincide with the prime minister’s visit to New Delhi to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It was a coincidence. Despite the decision, the ambassador had sufficient time to properly conclude all his engagements and duties there. The way he facilitated the process during the prime minister’s visit doesn’t reflect any misgivings about the government’s decision. So, it should be taken as a course that is in keeping with our tradition. In recent decades, other countries have given top priority to economic diplomacy, but the selection of our envoys and their activities doesn’t reflect that. Why aren’t we thinking in that direction?Yes, diplomacy in the past used to be one-dimensional, or it was conducted mainly by one particular ministry—the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. These days, many other ministries are engaged with international agencies. Economic diplomacy, labour diplomacy, climate diplomacy and security affairs have become crucial. We have to increase coordination, cooperation and collaboration among relevant agencies to make our international relations more fruitful and in line with the policies and goals set by our government.We have seen profound changes in terms of approaches, perspectives and dynamics of diplomacy in recent decades. All countries have started to give more importance to the competence of diplomats also in view of the increased geopolitical competition and rivalry seen between world powers. Rapid innovation in science and technology has not only eased our lives but also added challenges. We have to handle so many diplomatic engagements. Similarly, the number of international forums where we have to engage are increasing. These days, multilateral diplomacy and engagements have become as important. Even minilateral forums have started to play vital roles in international relations as the world powers have adopted multiple strategies to create their spheres of influence. In the meantime, the role of public diplomacy has become influential. So, a diplomat today must be dynamic and efficient enough to grasp the international situation, understand the sensitivity of the host country, articulate our country’s views efficiently and work in national interest. Therefore, it has become vital to be extra careful while selecting ambassadors.You talked about better coordination but we don’t see any correction in the practice of bypassing the foreign ministry while working with international agencies.Definitely, the foreign ministry is our focal point for all international relations conducted by a ministry or agency of our country. There should be no dispute about that. We need to make the foreign ministry more resourceful. Then, the ministry will have more capacity and efficiency to handle issues related to security, finance, labour and climate.Why have we failed to maintain reciprocity in terms of diplomats’ relations with the leaders of host countries? For example, our ambassadors in some capitals don’t get to meet the host leaders for years while the foreign envoys in Kathmandu can meet our prime minister and foreign minister directly and instantly.We have to see it from two perspectives. One is the power structure. In international relations, we can see the reflection of the asymmetric power relations between the big powers and other countries. The more developed and resourceful country’s influence in a host country can be seen and felt. Second, despite being an envoy from an underdeveloped or a small country, one can have diplomatic relations based on the principle of sovereign equality. It depends on the individual diplomat as well.In Kathmandu, we often err when dealing with foreign envoys. We have to decide what level of importance to give them. Therefore, some initiatives have been taken to correct and maintain consistency by implementing a diplomatic code of conduct that aims to integrate all activities through the foreign ministry. Foreign envoys will follow the system if we implement it consistently, irrespective of changes in the government. For that, there should be a political understanding at the national level.Let’s move to Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s recent India visit. Though it was mainly to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Indian Prime Minister Modi, he held some important political meetings. What are the takeaways from the visit?The visit was important from bilateral, regional and international perspectives. Traditionally, foreign affairs was described as an extended form of domestic affairs. But these days, international affairs have influence over domestic affairs as well. So such meetings and dialogues at the prime minister’s level are important. They exchanged views in a very cordial atmosphere. Of late, we have maintained bilateral dialogues at the political level on a regular basis and that has helped remove misunderstandings. Our prime minister’s emphasis is to hold bilateral dialogues both at the political as well as diplomatic levels in order to settle differences. India has taken this spirit positively.Second, the two prime ministers discussed how to expedite the implementation of the agreements reached between Nepal and India during Prime Minister Dahal’s official visit a year ago. The issue was discussed during the meeting between Prime Minister Dahal and Indian External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar as well. They also expressed satisfaction over progress in the implementation of bilateral agreements mainly in energy trade, connectivity and investment. In recent years, we have seen progress in investment, economic and trade sectors. Yet we still have some differences on border issues. That is an important and positive development in Nepal-India relations in recent years. In the past, when we had some differences on political, border or other issues, that used to badly affect other aspects of our relations. But now, both the countries agree to resolve outstanding issues through dialogue and our trade and all other affairs are moving ahead smoothly. This is the encouraging part of our relations. But border disputes can sour our relations anytime, right? Is there a sense of urgency to resolve it once and for all?The prime minister is for activating the concerned bilateral mechanisms to resolve such issues. He has also invited Indian Prime Minister Modi to visit Nepal. We can expect the Indian prime minister’s Nepal visit in near future. We can make some progress in resolving some outstanding matters such as border issues during the high level visit. I believe we will move ahead in this direction.Any progress on submitting the report of the Eminent Persons’ Group?During the meetings, the prime minister raised overall bilateral issues that include the matter related to the EPG report. I think once the mechanisms are activated and start working, that will create a situation for the report’s submission.Nepal and Bangladesh are completing homework for greater energy trade. India’s facilitation is a must for that. Is there any progress on securing the southern neighbour’s support for that?Progress in energy cooperation is a major achievement of this tenure of the prime minister. The progress is not limited to the bilateral level but goes to the regional level. A Cabinet committee of the Bangladesh government earlier this month approved a proposal to import 40 megawatts of electricity from Nepal. At present, we will use India’s infrastructure to export energy to Bangladesh. But for the long term there is a plan to build a dedicated transmission line for that. This shows it is not only Nepal that is interested in exporting its energy but other countries in this region are also interested in importing Nepal’s electricity. We have also signed an agreement to build a cross border transmission line with China. The doors are being opened for regional trade of our energy. This development will make India more open to importing energy from Nepal.Why are we failing to expedite projects under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) of China?The economic cooperation between Nepal and China has substantially increased after we joined the BRI framework. So, Nepal has been benefitting from the BRI. We see some concern about the lack of progress on certain infrastructure projects to be built under the BRI framework. In fact, we are in a better position to implement the projects because now we can decide what kind of BRI projects are good for us based on the experience of project development and implementation under the BRI in other countries.We are working to finalise the BRI implementation agreement. Nepal wants to move ahead by signing the implementation agreement and developing the projects. Nepal joined the BRI framework based on its need to diversify trade and connect to the world market. The reality is the same now. So, we need to sign the implementation plan and move ahead as soon as possible. When I attended the Boao Forum a few months ago, I found the Chinese authorities and other stakeholders holding debates to build quality and resilient infrastructure. They also have plans to support the capacity enhancement of human resources and transfer technology in the BRI member countries.People mainly link the BRI with big infrastructure projects such as railway, road and transmission connectivity but there is no significant progress on these fronts. What are the roadblocks?In Nepal, no big infrastructure project has been completed on time, be it the Melamchi drinking project, airports, hydropower or road projects. We haven’t developed the capacity to build big projects, and we don’t envision any plan to operate after building it. So, not only with China but also with other countries and agencies, we have to seek support for small and medium-size projects that we can efficiently build and operate. Also, the third version of the BRI action plan has included building not only big but small and smart projects under the framework. We have to push for that. As we build our capacity, we can gradually take up big projects. For instance, now we can build big hydro projects on our own. It wasn’t the case until some years ago. We developed expertise in hydropower by building many small projects in the past few decades and gradually enhanced our capacity. We have already faced problems in operating the Pokhara and Bhairahawa airports. Is there any progress in taking Chinese support to operate the airports?We have to see both aspects—domestic as well as international use—of the airports. The two airports have helped us upgrade the quality of our domestic air travel as the passengers have benefited due to the upgraded infrastructure. The number of domestic passengers in these airports has increased significantly.It is true that there is no progress in terms of operating them as international airports. The government is studying all possibilities of their use based on their unique features. We are exploring various options in international markets to attract adventure tourists to Pokhara. Chinese stakeholders are also holding some promotional activities in Pokhara. Chinese authorities have told us that they are consulting with their provincial bodies and exploring possibilities to run regular flights to Pokhara. Similarly, the government is mobilising our embassies and other stakeholders in certain countries having a large number of Buddhist tourists to operate flights to Bhairahawa, and we have received some positive responses. I believe we will be able to operate regular international flights from these two airports soon.It’s been eight years since we signed the trade and transit agreement with China, which was touted as a historic deal between the two countries. Why haven’t we been able to implement it?Some symbolic steps have been taken in this period. For instance, a shipment was received from a third country [Vietnam] using a Chinese port in September last year. Similar other initiatives have been taken but these are limited to symbolic gestures. We have to prepare infrastructure and some legal basis to implement the agreements in a more result-oriented way. A bilateral meeting is being held this week. The meeting is likely to discuss how to bring the trade and transit protocol in an effective way. This meeting will discuss various issues faced so far and will also pave the way forward. We have also proposed to form a ministerial-level mechanism to oversee overall bilateral issues. The upcoming meeting will sort out various issues.The Chinese side was conducting a feasibility study of the Keirung-Kathmandu cross-border railway project. What is the progress?There is progress in various projects that we are carrying out with Chinese support. The cross-border railway feasibility study is in the final stage. Likewise, the study on the Chhahare-Tokha tunnel project is ongoing. A Chinese team is arriving to conduct a feasibility study of the Hilsa-Simkot road. A process to award a contract to build a friendly bridge at Hilsa with Chinese grants has begun. A foundation stone will be laid there soon. Also, a study to build the Chilime-Rashuwagadhi-Keirung 220kV cross-border transmission line is beginning soon. \nThe government has decided to make the National ID Card mandatory in order to receive services from government and public institutions. In the first phase, the June 6 Cabinet meeting made the National ID card number mandatory in 28 districts. People including federal lawmakers criticised the decision saying that it was enforced without first distributing the cards. In this context, Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Yubaraj Katel, director general of the Department of National ID and Civil Registration.Let’s begin with a basic question. Why do we need a National ID card while we already have citizenship certificate, driving license, passport and voting card?There is a fundamental difference between a citizenship card and National ID. Citizenship establishes whether you are a citizen of the country and it helps you identify yourself with some basic details. In Nepal, it was also widely used as a service card. Wherever you go, you have to show the citizenship card—to open a bank account or acquire a SIM card for a phone. If we study international practices, there are mainly two cards—one is an identity card and the other is a service card. In 2018, the Nepal government came up with the idea of distributing national identity cards with a unique digital number for each eligible citizen. The number can track not only the individual but also the person’s activities and movements. This project has various components. First is data collection. It has two categories—demographic data, such as the names of father, mother and other family members. Second is biometric data—fingerprints, eye retina and digital signature. The biometric data is crucial to create a unique identity of each individual and avoid duplication in the integrated national database. The National ID has these two types of data. The other tasks are enrollment of the data, printing and distribution of the cards and then providing services based on that. At present, people carry multiple cards in their pockets. The objective of this project is to replace all of them by a single card–National ID. The new card includes vital details of all other cards in its chip with 1GB storage capacity. The government wanted to trace people based on their unique individual numbers so that there is no need to print and carry multiple cards. There is a huge industry of printing separate cards for each and every service that is creating a jumble of information. The National ID will not only replace multiple cards but also help authorities control criminal activities like financial frauds by removing duplication. At present, government authorities have difficulty in tracing and identifying an individual and wrongdoers are benefitting from that situation.What cards will be replaced by the National ID?It has a chip with 1GB storage capacity where you can store your driving license, academic documents, voting card, insurance details, ATM card number, etc. For instance, if you go to a telecom company to acquire a SIM card, they will ask for a copy of your citizenship card. You can say, ‘no, I have a National ID card’. Once you give your number and fingerprint, they can immediately verify it through the system. Another objective is to help people get rid of filling up pages of forms for each service. International governance has a norm that says don’t ask citizens their information more than once. A state agency should seek the information once and provide it to other state agencies if they require it. People complain that many agencies don’t accept National ID. They still ask for a citizenship card for official record and verification. So, in practice, it didn’t help people reduce the number of cards in their pockets. In fact, it added one more.Therefore, the June 6 Cabinet decision made the use of National ID cards compulsory in 28 districts. Now, it is going to be essential to get social security allowances, pensions and claim health insurance. The Health Insurance Board has said it has become challenging for them to verify whether a claimant is the rightful one. The board has 8 million policyholders. We will give them our details. Then, they can cross-check the authenticity of a claimant. This will help avoid huge financial frauds. In fact, the government should have made it mandatory earlier.But people including lawmakers in the federal parliament have strongly opposed the decision saying that the government made National ID mandatory without first distributing the cards to the people.Nepal’s total population is over 30 million. Our principal stakeholders are citizenship card holders. Those 16-year-olds are eligible for citizenship cards. The Election Commission distributes voting cards to those above 18 years. We got the data from the commission and added 20 percent and estimated that we have 18.6 people above 16 years old. As of Friday, we have already distributed the National ID numbers to 14.9 million people. Now, as per our estimate, around 3.7 million people are yet to get the National ID. Millions of people are abroad. Thus, we are headed towards saturation point in terms of data collection and issuance of the numbers. One thing I want to stress is that people don’t need a hard copy of the National ID card. The number is sufficient. Printing cards is costly. We have to pay around 2 euro to procure a blank card. The cost of printing, delivery and other overhead expenses is added to that. With the task of printing over a billion copies of ID cards being too costly, even India discourages use of hard copy of the cards. You can create the QR code of your card, save it in your mobile or print it in a paper and scan it wherever you need it.Officials at our government agencies bring up the rule that makes it mandatory to present a physical copy of citizenship card or other documents for official works.Yes, we are trained and habituated in that way. Now we need to change. We must make offices paperless while developing a strong database system. We have been using citizenship cards to verify the identity of a person for a long time. Biometrics not only helps identify people but also trace their activities. Recently, Rs2 billion was found in the bank accounts of a 26-year-old man. The money was deposited in 56 bank accounts. He used 13 ATM cards and 17 phone numbers. Once the National ID card is implemented, transactions and movements of such wrongdoers will be easily traced and monitored. Identifying individuals accurately is crucial to ensure good governance and strengthen security. Many people have acquired fake citizenship cards. People even made fake passports. Implementation of National ID will control it. It is also related to our national image. It will help improve the status of our passport and add authenticity to our other documents as well.Once the National ID comes into wide use, our details will be traced and used by multiple agencies. State agencies and other institutions benefit from the integrated database as they can easily trace us. But how do you ensure our data isn’t misused and it doesn’t make us insecure?If you have a National ID card, you don’t need a hard copy of your driving licence. There is a backlog of around 2.1 million licences. The government has failed to print and distribute them. We told them, we have already procured 12 million cards. Of them, 3.2 million cards have already been printed and we still need to print around 8 million cards. Once the licence data is integrated with the National ID card, it will be shown there. Now, to come to your question, only the traffic authority can access the licence-related data. The device they use will trace only relevant data. Only an authorised agency will get access to the data and it can’t be used for anything other than the stated purpose. We give access to agencies like Nepal Rastra Bank, Nepal Telecommunication Authority and Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal. Then they regulate the things in their domain. No unauthorised body or individual can access it. Do the implementing agencies have infrastructure to use this technology?We are in a position to implement it in some parts of the country. Therefore, we are implementing it in phases. We are making it mandatory for certain services in 28 districts from mid-July. We should have started much earlier. It must be expedited.Lawmakers said in a Parliament meeting that the decision has ‘terrorised people’ in the 28 districts as locals feared they might be deprived of the services as the government has made National ID cards mandatory without first distributing them.We started the National ID registration process from 2018. Registration teams reached in each local ward except in Mugu and Humla districts of Karnali. It was carried out as a campaign. Even after the drive’s completion, the registration process was open in all the 77 districts, 54 area administration offices and in palika (local unit) centres. We also had registration centres in major downtowns. We receive data of around 4,000 registrations a day. So, there has been sufficient initiative and enough time to encourage people to get the number. Besides, if anyone in the 28 districts are still to get the ID number, they still have three months to register.You said only an ID number but no hard copy was needed to access any kind of service, right?Exactly. There is no provision that states one should produce a hard copy to get any service. You give the number and your biometrics to verify that you are the right person. Then, the official can crosscheck it in the database within seconds.Do all the implementing agencies have the devices that read the National ID cards?We have distributed 4,200 machines that read the cards in 333 local units of the 28 districts. Likewise, we have asked other local units and districts and some agencies such as banks to procure the devices and we have given the specifications based on their requirements. A device costs just around Rs 1,500. You can enter the number and place your thumbprint on it. We have trained relevant officials from all the local units for the purpose.How many cards can the department print at present?We can produce 1,500 cards an hour. But now we are producing only 1,800 a day. We have the strength to distribute 30,000 cards a day but are distributing only 5,000 a day.Again the same question. Then why are people not getting the cards?There is some communication gap. People who registered in 2018 or 2019 haven’t contacted us. We are giving them priority to clear the backlogs. But people who are newly-registered are showing more interest. So, we need to strike the right balance.When will the department be in a position to distribute the cards to all the people?At present, we can print 100,000 cards a month. We have a space to double the capacity. Meanwhile, people have now shown more interest. By enhancing our facilities’ capacity, we can print the pending 8 million cards in the next 40 months.What about election cards? Do we need to register for that and get the voting cards?In fact, the Election Commission doesn’t need to collect data and issue cards. We will talk to them. As a constitutional body, we have to readily make the data available for them. In fact, the National ID Card system can help the commission make voting arrangements for the Nepalis abroad because it can accurately identify the right person and can immediately update the integrated system here in Nepal about the votes cast in any country. This card will be helpful in conducting fair elections because the biometric data stored in this system will be perfect bases to identify the people and instantly update the activities in the database.You have emphasised replacement of other cards by the National ID cards. How long may it take to do so?We plan on giving priority to three sectors—banking, civil aviation and telecom. People right now need to fill separate forms for these services that have irked the service seekers. We have asked the bankers to buy the devices. We as a supplier are ready. Now the stakeholders should be ready too. It will benefit them because it helps control frauds.What if I don’t register for the National ID card?In the first place, you will be deprived of social security funds, pension, insurance policies. Likewise, the government will gradually make the card compulsory to receive many other services such as driving licence, land transaction, telephone numbers, bank accounts. How do you assure that our data stored in this system isn’t misused?See, the current practices make you more vulnerable. Because multiple agencies take your data for various purposes. Do they have a system to protect the data and ensure that it isn’t misused? But when your data is stored only by a dedicated government agency, it will be more secure as the agency is specialised for that. When other authorised agencies seek data, we give them access only to the relevant one. We have a National Identity Management Information System (NIMIS). We have maintained three layers of security—L1, L2, L3—to ensure foolproof security of the data. There are three servers.Are we dependent on any foreign company for any related service?So far, only one international vendor is involved but we are cutting down its involvement as well, with a plan to ultimately replace it by our own agency. The vendor now helps transfer collected data to the printing machine through the Automated Biometric Identification System (ABIS). But our plan is to do so through our own government agency or local vendor. We do all the other tasks. Security printing is done within the office basement where every movement of people is monitored and recorded. \nPrithvi Subba Gurung, deputy general secretary of the CPN-UML, is one of the leaders who strongly lobbied for a federal system while the Constituent Assembly was writing the constitution between 2008 to 2015. Eight years after the adoption of the federal democratic republican constitution, the federal system, particularly the provinces, are widely being criticised for their supposed failure to deliver. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asks former Gandaki chief minister Gurung what went wrong in the course of implementing the federal system.The implementation of the federal system has faced several hurdles since its adoption. Most provinces have for months failed even to form the governments, let alone run them efficiently. Where is the problem?We have adopted a federal system but are working against its spirit. Provinces should run autonomously. On some key issues, federal leaders and the party’s central bodies may give some direction to their provincial bodies. But most provincial activities are still centrally-governed even years after the adoption of federalism. So, our practices aren’t in line with the system. The provincial governments shouldn’t have been affected by the changes in the federal coalition. Such problems were seen in India years ago. But they have learned from their experience. In our case, leaders of major political parties treated the provincial governments as party chapters. The provincial governments are formed and run as per the constitution and all the three tiers of the governments are autonomous. The high commands in our political parties aren’t ready to accept the new constitutional setup.Are the provincial leaders equally responsible as they seek Kathmandu’s nod before taking any important decisions?They seek the centre’s support because they are trained in that way. They are too dependent on the centre. You said India learned by experience and now provinces there work more autonomously. But, in Nepal, provinces are now witnessing more problems than during their first tenure, which is evident also in the difficulties in government formation in multiple provinces. Why couldn’t they learn from the five-year experience?Nepal’s leaders and political parties are still not committed to federalism. They have failed to implement the federal system as per the spirit of the constitution. This is the major problem. The big parties as well as their leaders are guided by a centralised mindset and still prefer working in a unitary system. We should not forget that we transformed the executive and legislative bodies into three tiers of federal systems. But our judiciary retained the old structure. Therefore, the judiciary doesn’t accept the federal system and its practice in a true sense. Its verdicts reflect the same.The role of Speakers and Province Heads has courted controversies in multiple provinces. The top court invalidated some of their decisions. Is it because of lack of clarity, faults in our constitutional provisions, or is it because of the leaders?Speaker and Province Head are political posts created in accordance with constitutional provisions. When overall politics is dirty and unhealthy, those taking up these responsibilities also feel compelled to resort to similar tactics. When overall politics improves, they automatically make better decisions. Mainly there is no leader in the high command who completely owns federalism and is determined to implement it in its true spirit. This government in its policies and programmes unveiled last month had rightly said that “protecting federalism and strengthening the federal democratic republic is our top priority”. But the budget failed to introduce programmes as per the promises made in the policies and programmes.How do we correct these anomalies? Where do we begin?We are in a complex situation. Many have started to float the idea of making amendments to the constitution. But we shouldn’t forget that various forces and stakeholders had their own positions during constitution-making. They made compromises and found middle grounds to promulgate the constitution. If we go for amendments, they all will return to their respective stances. Some may want to revive the Hindu Kingdom while others will stand against it. Some leaders even within Nepali Congress have started to advocate for constitutional monarchy. But we can’t regress to the monarchical system. We can’t renounce secularism and an inclusive democratic system. We can’t backtrack on our commitment to a socialism-oriented system. We may explore some changes in our electoral system or form of governance without going against these key features of our constitution but we can’t destabilise the charter. What are the major flaws to be fixed?There are some. For instance, provinces have no role in education. The responsibility of education up to secondary level is given to the local level. And, everything is controlled by the federal government. The local units are entrusted with key responsibilities such as developing curriculum, overseeing the issues of career developments of teachers and staffers and their promotion as well as transfers etcetera. Local units can’t do all of these things efficiently as they have their own limitations. How can a local unit transfer a teacher from Kaski to Lamjung? Provinces should have been given such responsibilities. The power has been centralised at Singha Durbar. Such is also the situation in other sectors.Though the proportional representation (PR) system is hailed as one of the most beautiful features of our constitution in terms of ensuring inclusion, it has also been blamed for political instability. Many have demanded revision in the electoral system.The major political parties such as the CPN-UML and Nepali Congress have not trained their party members on the proper implementation of key constitutional features such as federalism and electoral system. The party members and general people have either wrongly understood it, or have negative impressions about the systems. These systems were adopted with an objective to resolve our decade-long conflict and address the concerns of the historically marginalised communities and even mainstream some groups through an inclusive democratic system. The idea was to integrate all the communities and maintain unity in diversity. After holding years-long debates on various options, we agreed on the mixed electoral system so as to reflect our diversity in the state agencies.As the proverb goes, “the bad workman blames his tools”, our leaders are blaming the system for their failure to secure a majority by winning people’s trust. Many countries that practise similar electoral systems have progressed. Our electoral system and the form of governance are not causing political instability. Many countries have adopted a parliamentary system and many others have practised the presidential model. Countries have progressed in both the systems. Also, there are examples of failures under both setups. So, the problem lies in our political parties and leaders, not in the systems. Shouldn’t political parties like the UML and Congress work with a plan to secure a majority by winning people’s trust? They aren’t training their focus on that but blaming the system. At times, they have squandered the majority as well and have failed to keep the party intact. Isn’t it our [leaders’] failure?Some argue that the issue of the fractured mandate can be addressed by increasing the threshold ceiling for political parties to be eligible to get PR votes and that can be done by amending election laws. Does it help?This is the idea coming from big political parties because they get more votes when fringe parties disqualify for PR votes. But a higher ceiling may deprive many small parties from representing certain communities. So, this goes against the spirit of inclusion. What we need is a good coalition culture. If we see the trend of recent decades, Indian politicians have become much more mature in this context. In the past, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi accommodated his electoral alliance partners in his ruling coalition even though his party won the majority single-handedly. If we scrap the inclusive electoral system, won’t the marginalised communities again revolt? We should be careful about that.At times, leaders have helped dissident groups split their party. These are the same leaders who issued an ordinance to change the provision that required a group within a political party to show support of 40 percent members of the party’s central committee “and” the parliamentary party. Only then could it split. They changed the threshold to 20 percent, and the “and” provision had been changed to “or”. The provision of requiring 40 percent support on both sides had earlier been included to ensure political stability. But the leaders who are helping party divisions are blaming the system for instability in the country. So, we [leaders] have to mend our ways, not blame the system. The Rastriya Swantantra Party, the fourth-largest in the lower house, has officially said that it wants to overhaul the federal system and drastically downsize the provinces. Also, leaders within the major parties who earlier stood in favour of federalism have started criticising it. On Saturday, Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa said the country can’t sustain the provinces in their present form. What is your view?I am one of those who advocated for a federal system even before the first Constituent Assembly because Nepal is a country full of discrimination based on caste, class, region and religion. We advocated for the system to do away with these discriminations and find a system to maintain unity within diversity. Federalism is the best system to promote national unity as all groups get their own space as per their unique features. For instance, if you make multiple rooms in a building, you can give space and adjust more people. But if you keep many people inside a big room, they will have difficulties—no matter how big the room is. We should strengthen the federal system. We can’t regress.Then, why do many people see provinces as a burden?In Nepal, the federal system was projected as a structure that resulted in huge liability to the state coffers. But the facts don’t substantiate it. A local unit in the federal structure replaced many erstwhile Village Development Committees (VDCs). For instance, in my home district of Lamjung, eight palikas covered the areas of 61 VDCs, and the expenditure of the current eight local units is no more than that of the erstwhile 61 VDCs. Now we don’t need 77 district coordination committees. They can be scrapped. No province needs more than seven ministers. Likewise, the federal Cabinet can be drastically downsized. Why do we need a 25-strong Cabinet at the centre when we already have seven other provincial cabinets? Twelve ministries are enough at the centre, as suggested by the high level commission on administration reform.There are many departments and divisions that were designed under the unitary system that have become completely redundant in the federal setup. So many project offices established over two decades ago based on the needs of that time are still there. These irrelevant bodies should be scrapped. This is how we can significantly cut down on administrative costs. Leaders and people don’t discuss that. They only blame provinces. \nThe weather across the country is forecast to be partly to generally cloudy on Thursday.Light to moderate rain accompanied by thunder and lightning is expected in several regions, including Koshi Province, Madhesh Province, Gandaki Province, Lumbini and Bagmati Province.

Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nIt has been over a week since the Nepali Congress and CPN-UML agreed to form a new government under the leadership of the CPN-UML chair KP Oli, but they have yet to settle the ministry-wise portfolio division.Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who lost his majority after the UML and other parties withdrew their support, will face a vote of confidence on Friday as required by the constitution. This will be Dahal’s fifth floor test since becoming the prime minister in December 2022. It is almost certain that he will not secure the majority, which means President Ram Chandra Poudel will have to call for the formation of a new government. As soon as the prime minister fails the vote, Speaker Devraj Ghimire will inform President Poudel of the results. The UML is planning to claim the formation of the new government with the support of over two-thirds of the lawmakers, a central committee member of the party told the Post.But it is not clear whether the President will appoint Oli as the next prime minister after the UML submits the signature of the two-thirds lawmakers or he will give political parties one to three days to form a new government under Article 76 (3).President Poudel is consulting his team as well as his advisors, said an aide.As per the initial power-sharing agreement between Deuba and Oli, Congress will get 11 ministries and the UML will get 10. But as more parties have decided to extend support to Oli, they will need to accommodate other fringe parties in the government.Despite these preparations, the Congress and the UML have yet to finalise their nominees for ministers. Oli is likely to be sworn in on Tuesday once the prime minister election process is completed. Sources citing an informal agreement between the two parties said the Congress will lead the home and foreign affairs ministries, and the UML finance and defence ministries.“We are lobbying for General Secretary Gagan Thapa to lead the Congress team in the new government,” Bishwa Prakash Sharma, another general secretary of the party, told the Post. Thapa is interested to lead the Ministry of Home Affairs, but Congress chief Sher Bahadur Deuba wants Ramesh Lekhak as the new home minister, according to Congress leaders. “If Thapa leads another ministry, but is given the position of deputy prime minister, he should join the government,” said Sharma.Dozens of lawmakers have expressed their intent to become ministers this time, so the party’s leadership, including Deuba, is in a difficult situation regarding whom to send and whom not to.Deuba's spouse, Arzu Rana, is widely expected to be the next foreign minister. Other potential Congress ministers include Chandra Bhandari, Jeevan Pariyar, Tejulal Chaudhary, and Ajay Chaurasiya, among others. Besides Thapa, senior Nepali Congress leaders like Prakash Man Singh and Krishna Prasad Situala, among others, are also interested in leading the party in the new Cabinet, according to sources. General Secretary Sharma, however, told the Post that he would not join the new government. Singh, due to his senior position inside the party and the support he had extended in the past to help Deuba win the party presidency, has a high chance of leading the Congress team in the government, if General Secretary Thapa does not join the government, according to Nepali Congress leaders. Thapa has reportedly set some conditions, including deputy prime ministership, for him to lead the party’s team in the Oli Cabinet.Although Sharma claimed that they would lobby for Thapa, Thapa himself, speaking at a function in Biratnagar on Thursday, said he would not join the new government.“I have told the party leadership that I will work as general secretary and not join the government,” said Thapa.He also claimed that as soon as the process of forming the new government begins, the seven-point agreement signed between Oli and Deuba at midnight of July 1 will be made public.“We will discuss with the party president on Friday about sending the Congress team in the government under Thapa’s leadership,” said Sharma. However, UML chief Oli, who is all set to become the new prime minister, is reportedly against having the deputy prime minister portfolio this time. That is one major reason why the two parties have been unable to finalise the portfolio division.If the post of deputy prime minister remains, UML’s Bishnu Poudel, who previously served in that role, might be appointed deputy prime minister and finance minister, according to UML leaders. However, Oli is not keen on bringing Poudel into the Cabinet, according to the leaders. Padma Aryal, UML's party secretary, said a secretariat meeting of the party on Wednesday had already entrusted Oli with selecting ministers.There is also a long list of aspirants in the UML hoping to become ministers in the new Oli Cabinet. If the deputy prime minister portfolio is removed, Oli is likely to pick Rishikesh Pokhrel as the next finance minister, according to the leaders. Pokhrel is the chairman of the Public Account Committee of the House of Representatives. \nPushpa Kamal Dahal secured the vote of confidence in four consecutive tries after becoming the prime minister on December 25, 2022, but when he goes for his fifth on Friday, he is almost sure to fail.After CPN-UML, the largest coalition partner, withdrew its support to the government on July 3, Prime Minister Dahal has been leading the minority government.Soon after the UML withdrew its support, the Janata Samajbadi Party, led by Ashok Rai, also pulled the plug on the government. The CPN-UML has 77 seats and the newly formed Rai-led party has 7 seats in the House of Representatives.Dahal on July 5 decided to go for the floor test after the UML’s withdrawal of the support.Dahal opted for the floor test in accordance with Article 100(2) of the constitution which says, “If the political party which the prime minister represents is divided or a political party in coalition government withdraws its support, the prime minister shall table a motion in the House of Representatives for a vote of confidence within thirty days.”Dahal, who had the support of 268 lawmakers in his first attempt at a floor test, is likely to see that vote slashed by almost 200 this time.As things stood on Thursday, Dahal is most likely to get 32 votes from his CPN (Maoist Centre), 21 from the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) and 10 from the CPN (Unified Socialist).The parliamentary party meeting of Unified Socialist on Thursday decided to give Prime Minister Dahal the trust vote.Though the RSP has called a meeting of its parliamentary party on Friday morning, a party lawmaker said, “Since we have been continuing in the government despite being in a minority, we are morally bound to give the vote of trust to Prime Minister Dahal.”On July 4, RSP leaders had announced they’d quit the government but ministers from the party met the prime minister later that day and decided not to resign immediately. They said they backtracked on their plan after the prime minister sought their support until the floor test.To secure a majority in the 275-strong House, one needs 138 votes.The Congress and the UML, which have 88 and 77 House of Representatives seats, respectively, have already decided to vote against Prime Minister Dahal. Likewise, the Rastriya Prajantra Party, which has 14 seats, has also decided to vote against Dahal.The Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal, led by Upendra Yadav, and the Janata Samajbadi Party, led by Ashok Rai, which have 5 and 7 seats, respectively, have said they will vote against Dahal.The Loktantrik Samajbadi Party, which has four seats in the House, is also standing against Dahal during the floor test. “Our party is a member of the democratic alliance led by the Nepali Congress,” Ram Parkash Chaudhary, a lawmaker of the party, told the Post. “Therefore, we will vote against Prime Minister Dahal.”Dahal also will not get the trust vote of the Nagarik Unmukti Party. “Since our party has already withdrawn support to the Dahal government, our party will stand against him during the floor test,” Ranjita Shrestha, a lawmaker of the party, told the Post.The CK Raut-led Janamat Party, which has six seats in the lower house, will also stand against Prime Minister Dahal. “The party has already decided to stand against Prime Minister Dahal’s trust motion,” Abdul Khan, a lawmaker of the party, said.After the November 2022 election, Dahal, chief of the third-largest party in the House, continuously led the government for over one-and-a-half years exploiting the support of both the Congress and the UML, by turn. During this period, the UML backed Dahal two times while the Congress supported him once to form the government.Dahal first became the prime minister with the UML’s support. But the Congress was bent on breaking the UML-Maoist alliance and supported him in the vote of confidence after his swearing-in.After that, Dahal and Deuba started hobnobbing. When Dahal decided to support Congress candidate Ramchandra Paudel in the presidential election, the UML withdrew its support to the Dahal government on February 26, 2023.When Dahal faced the second floor test on March 20, he secured 172 votes in the House.Dahal, during the second trust vote, was supported by the Congress, Rastriya Swatantra Party, Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal (before the party split), Unified Socialist, Janamat Party, Loktantrik Samajbadi Party, Nagarik Unmukti Party, three independent lawmakers and a lawmaker of Rastriya Janamorcha.On March 4, Dahal broke its coalition with the Congress to join hands with the UML. He then went for the floor test for the third time on March 13.In his third floor test, Dahal received 157 votes from the UML, RSP, Janata Samajbadi Party, Unified Socialist, and Nagarik Unmukti Party, in addition to his own party.Meanwhile, Dahal again went for the floor test on May 20, for the fourth time, just two months after his third attempt. This time, he had to seek the parliament’s confidence after a group of seven lawmakers from his coalition partner Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal split the party and formed a new outfit under Ashok Rai’s leadership on May 5.After the party split, JSP-Nepal chair Upendra Yadav withdrew its support to the government. In the subsequent floor test, Dahal garnered 157 votes.Out of 12 political parties in the House of Representatives, along with the first and second largest parties—the Congress and the UML—other 10 parties and five independent lawmakers supported Dahal when he sought a vote of trust for the first time after the 2022 election.In the hung parliament, there are only two scenarios to form the government. Either the Congress and the UML should come together, or one of them should build the majority with the support of other fringe parties to form the government.This time, the Congress and the UML decided to forge a partnership despite the odds. As per the understanding between the two parties, UML chief KP Sharma Oli will lead a ‘national consensus government’ for a year and a half. After that, Sher Bahadur Deuba, the Congress president, will succeed him for the remaining term of the House. \nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that Nepal’s economy, still reeling from subdued domestic demand and post‑pandemic balance sheet repairs, may face an increasingly gloomy and uncertain outlook, mainly due to fragile political stability and cooperatives failure.The global lender, which provides policy advice and financing to its members to foster growth and financial stability, said Nepal’s fragile political stability could disrupt policy continuity and reform implementation. Nepal is set to elect the new prime minister next week. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is almost certain to fail the trust vote. This will be his fifth trust vote in a year and a half. The CPN-UML withdrew its support to the government on July 3 after it ditched its coalition with the CPN (Maoist Centre) and joined hands with the Nepali Congress to form a new government.This is the fourth time in Nepal’s political history that two major parties are forming a government without a powerful opposition, which observers say weakens democracy's effective functioning.On Tuesday, the IMF completed the fourth review under its four‑year extended credit facility, allowing Nepal to withdraw $41.3 million to help the country's economic recovery.This brings total disbursements under the extended credit facility for budget support to $247.7 million.The IMF executive board approved the extended credit facility arrangement for Nepal on January 12, 2022. The approved amount totals $371.6 million, which is 180 percent of Nepal’s special drawing rights quota (SDR) of 282.42 million.“Nepal’s economy continues to face challenges,” said the statement issued by the IMF on Thursday. It said that Nepal’s growth projected at 3 percent in the fiscal year 2023-24 remains below potential due to subdued domestic demand and post‑pandemic balance sheet repairs. The IMF has talked about Nepal’s cooperatives sector for the first time.In the statement, the IMF warned about the intensification of financial sector vulnerabilities, such as a further rise in non-performing loans. In this context, “more failures of cooperative lenders could endanger the banking system's soundness,” the IMF said.According to experts and bankers interviewed by the Post, cooperatives, which the government once embraced as one of the three pillars of the economy, are now threatening the economy.In Nepal, millions of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are heavily involved in cooperatives, and their failure could not only damage the fragile economy, but also harm social harmony, say experts. Cooperatives are involved in sectors ranging from dairy and livestock to tailoring and retail.Recently, thousands of victims of cooperatives fraud have staged protests in various parts of the country, demanding the return of deposits embezzled by cooperative operators. Hundreds of such depositors came to Kathmandu and staged protests. The government recently signed an agreement with them, promising to solve their problems as soon as possible.“The problem in the cooperative sector will shake up the banking sector. But if there is a wise move, the banking sector can absorb the shock,” said Upendra Poudyal, president of the Confederation of Banks and Financial Institutions Nepal. He said that the regulation of cooperatives has already been delayed. “We have seen that cooperatives are being operated for personal gains. A limited number of people took the benefit.” “Now, the central bank should begin with a single threshold. Limit the number and start supervision.” As of mid-March, there are 31,450 cooperatives in Nepal, with 7.38 million members. The deposit mobilisation in cooperatives amounted to Rs478 billion, while credit mobilisation stood at Rs405 billion. They currently employ 94,000 people.In a recent interview, Kashi Raj Dahal, immediate past chairman of the Crisis-ridden Cooperatives Management Committee, a government agency, told the Post that globally, most cooperatives work in productive sectors like food production, dairy, fruits and other agricultural activities. “But in Nepal, around 25,000 cooperatives are involved only in financial activities, mainly collecting deposits and issuing loans. Such cooperatives are now in crisis. Over 15,000 are registered to collect deposits. Even others registered as multi-purpose cooperatives primarily engage in savings and credits. Around 500 cooperatives are currently in trouble.”The Dahal-led government has promised the return of at least Rs500,000 to each depositor by recovering it from the directors' assets. Yet doubts persist about whether depositors will get back their money. Some economists have warned about potential mass protests if the cooperatives issue is not taken seriously.The IMF has also warned that the failure to raise the execution rate of large-scale projects would deprive the economy of much-needed stimulus and weigh on growth. On the pessimistic side, the IMF said that economic activity is expected to increase, reaching 4.9 percent in 2024-25, supported by more robust domestic demand. The statement reads that the cautiously accommodative monetary policy stance, the planned increase in capital expenditures in the 2024-25 budget, additional hydropower generation, and a continued rise in tourist arrivals are expected to boost domestic demand and growth. Inflation is expected to remain within the Nepal Rastra Bank’s (NRB) target ceiling of 5.5 percent.“Nepal has made important strides on its economic reform agenda. Decisive actions in monetary policy, bank regulation and rolling off Covid support policies played a major role in overcoming urgent balance of payments pressure in 2021-22,” said Bo Li, deputy managing director of IMF. “Reserves continue to rise without the need to use distortive import restrictions. Despite revenue shortfalls, fiscal discipline was maintained in 2022-23 and 2023-24. Bank supervision and regulation have improved by rolling out new supervisory information systems. Nepal’s medium-term outlook remains favourable as strategic investments in infrastructure, especially in the energy sector, are expected to support potential growth.”The IMF said that strengthening public investment management would support the needed boost to capital spending. Enhancing fiscal transparency will help contain fiscal risks and strengthen medium-term fiscal sustainability.“As monetary policy transmission is still weak in a context of balance sheet repair, a cautious and data-dependent monetary policy remains appropriate to preserve price and external stability,” the IMF said.  \nAmid an economic slowdown, the banking sector is looking for a slightly loose monetary policy to boost the confidence of the financial and private sectors, including individuals. The banking sector expects favourable working capital guidelines, which will open avenues for the financial industry and traders to increase their economic activities. In this context, the Post’s Krishana Prasain caught up with Upendra Prasad Poudel, chairman of Nabil Bank, to discuss the economy and the banking sector amid Nepal’s ballooning foreign exchange reserves and slowed lending. Excerpts:The monetary policy is due soon. What are the expectations of the banking industry?Our expectations from monetary policy are high as the country’s economy is going through a challenging situation. Some people say the economy is in crisis. But I don't call it a crisis because the external sector, including key economic indicators, is doing well. The country’s economy is looking for a boost—confidence where it will be easy for everyone to work in tandem. Our economic base is small. It will not take a long time for the economy to revive. In that background, we need a loose monetary policy to address everyone's needs.A loose monetary policy aims to stimulate economic activity and reduce unemployment by lowering interest rates and increasing the money supply. Without a loose monetary policy, building the private sector confidence is difficult. Liquidity is sufficient. To increase the credit demand, there is a need to boost consumption. To increase consumption, people need to have enough cash in their hands. That demands government and private sector investments. This depends on both fiscal and monetary policies. For instance, the construction sector is facing trouble, and as a result, there is not much economic activity with the government failing to pay the contractors. When contractors are not getting money, they are not giving it to workers. So the money is not reaching the people. As a result, consumption has remained stagnant. The government is not giving subsidies to agriculture or the insurance sector. We learn that the government needs more money. The private sector no longer trusts the government’s fiscal policy. In contrast, since the banking sector is regulated and disciplined, everyone looks up to monetary policy. Naturally, the private sector has high expectations from the central bank. What kind of policies are needed to revive the economy? As I said, public consumption needs to grow. To boost consumption, there is a need to increase credit. In the past, the banking sector made aggressive lending, but the credit did not go into the real economy or the productive sector. So, the central bank and commercial banks are now worried. Even though credit has seen a growth lately, the impact is not visible. At one level, the money needs to reach everyone's hands. So monetary policy needs to encourage credit flow. There is a slowdown in the banking industry, too. Banks are not able to offer dividends. Positive developments also exist. Interest has been cut, which will reduce capital costs, ultimately increasing output and consumption.Foreign exchange reserves are at a record high. Banks’ lending has yet to improve. What does this show?People are spending less. Reduced spending means that the demand for goods and services has declined. Even though the interest rate has declined, banks struggle to boost credit. As the foreign exchange rate increases, we have the space to increase imports. Banks have liquidity and the capacity to disburse funds. Interest rates are also declining, and the environment is becoming more conducive. But the demand for loans is a must. The confidence in the system must be high for the demand for loans to grow. The International Monetary Fund also indicates that Nepal’s situation may improve in the next fiscal year, depending on the monetary policy. What is sustainable banking? Why are Nepali banks reluctant to follow it?We look at sustainable banking in a futuristic way. We work for days beyond today. We work for tomorrow's generation. We work to make resources available for tomorrow. We must work to make everything sustainable. We have to preserve nature. Banks have gone for short-term profits. That's how we have deviated from sustainability. But our banks still need to go for sustainable practices. The central bank defines the productive sector including energy as the real economy. Investing in those sectors leads to sustainability.Our system ranks banks on the basis of profit, the number of depositors or the volume of loans. In reality, though, to be number one, the parameter should be the impact the bank has on the economy, environment, and society. Knowingly or unknowingly, everyone is talking about sustainable banking. Many banks have started reporting their carbon footprints. Many banks, including Nabil, have started various schemes for agriculture. There are products for women entrepreneurship for inclusive development and migrant workers as well. The banking sector needs to be aware of responsible investment. The central bank has been reinforcing this idea from time to time. How have cooperatives issues affected banks?As the financial system is interlinked, problems in the cooperative sector have impacted the banking sector directly or indirectly. Some cooperative deposits are with banks, and the bank's money has also gone to cooperatives. Not only cooperatives but some credit to loan sharks might have been sourced from banks, too. These are serious issues that need to be tackled prudently. We sense that the problem in the cooperatives sector will shake up the banking sector one day. The banking sector is highly regulated and has the capacity to absorb any shock, though it may not make a profit as before. Regulating cooperatives is difficult now: it’s already too late. The SME sector complains that getting bank loans isn’t easy. What can be done to increase credit flow?We are the custodians of depositors and cannot lend money to anyone easily. We draw a borderline to mitigate possible risk. Lack of financial literacy is still prevailing, and we have been working to create awareness. The financial sector has become transparent, but the private sector hasn’t. The government needs to create an environment that makes businesses transparent. The banks have started taking steps to develop and scale up entrepreneurship. Such initiative needs to be taken by the government, including the local level. The growth in entrepreneurship will stop our youths from going abroad. The government needs to spend heavily on developing entrepreneurship by supporting startups. Nepal has started cross-border digital payment. How has the banking sector started preparation, especially on the operating side?Banks have made a giant leap in terms of digital payment. Certain levels of credit are being approved online. Bank accounts are opened online, and security documents are automatically generated. We have moved ahead in the information and technology systems in the banking sector. However, we are still in the infancy when it comes to the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in the banking sector. To make transactions with India more comprehensive, we need support from Indian regulators, especially in preventing illegal transactions. With proper regulations and support, digital payments will boom. \nThe reconstruction of Achham Durbar, a historical palace in Mangalsen severely damaged by Maoist bombing during the insurgency, nears completion after 16 years.The local people are elated to see the palace being restored to its original shape and style. “The Achham Durbar is an identity of Mangalsen and the entire Achham district,” said Khagendra BK, a local resident. “The locals were anxious as the reconstruction work had commenced six years after the palace was damaged, and the work was delayed under various pretexts.”The historical palace was severely damaged when the Maoist insurgents bombed it on February 16, 2002. In the explosion, a total of 122 people were killed, including the then Chief District Officer Mohan Singh Khatri.In 2008, the government had allocated Rs22.5 million for the reconstruction of the palace, originally built in the style of Kathmandu’s Hanuman Dhoka Durbar. Locals say the reconstruction work was affected by political pressure and negligence of the contractor, among other things. BK said that major political parties repeatedly raised the issue of the palace reconstruction during election campaigns but forgot it afterwards. “The political parties here have made the palace an election agenda. Now, when it appears that the construction is almost complete, they are trying to take credit saying it was possible because of them,” he said. “The palace is almost ready. The remaining work should not be stopped under any pretext.” The palace, also known as Mangalsen Durbar, sits in the middle of the Mangalsen market. “Since the palace was destroyed, the entire market seems incomplete and quiet,” said 80-year-old Kapure Nagarjee, a resident of Mangalsen. “Even though it took years to rebuild, the palace looks just like how it used to. This palace is connected to the history of Achham. It feels like history has come alive rather than just being a reconstructed palace,” he said.The historical palace is being rebuilt under the supervision of the Department of Archaeology. As the project nears completion, discussions have started about its use and ownership. Padam Bahadur Bohara, mayor of Mangalsen Municipality, said now there should be a discussion about who will own it. “Government offices including the district administration office and the police office were housed in the palace when it was destroyed. Separate buildings for these offices are being built now,” said Bohara. “The palace can be used as a museum. But what should be kept in it. All the historical artefacts inside the durbar were destroyed in the attack. It is better to use the palace as an administrative office of Magalsen Municipality.”Chief District Officer of Achham, Shiva Prasad Lamsal, said that his office has been overseeing the construction work and the palace will be ready by the Dashain festival, which falls in the month of October. “The roof of the palace has been covered. So work can continue even when it’s raining,” he said. “The authorities and stakeholders should sit together and formulate operational guidelines for the management and protection of the palace.” Currently, about 90 percent of the reconstruction work is complete.For the reconstruction of the palace, a contract was signed in 2010 with five construction companies namely Rajendra, Saud, Tulchidurga, Badimalika and Kuwar. In the beginning, work was delayed as Meen Bahadur Kuwar was authorised to carry out the work, but other companies left after receiving some payments. Currently, Rajendra and Saud Construction are in charge of the construction. Jaya Bahadur Saud, director of Saud Construction, said the difficulty in sourcing the specific wood needed for the old structure has been causing some delays.Earlier, the palace housed various offices including the district administration office, land revenue office, district court, among others. But at the time of the Maoist attack, only the district administration office was there. In the incident, 122 people including 53 soldiers, 59 policemen, two civil servants including the chief district officer, and eight civilians were killed. The construction of Achham Durbar began 150 years ago during the reign of the local king TikaBhuk Shah of Magalsen and was completed in around 1878 during the reign of his son Dal Bahadur Shah. According to Surat Bahadur Shah, an expert on Achham’s history, the government bought the palace for Rs90,000 from Yogendra Bahadur Shah, the son of the Achham king, in 1972. Yogendra Bahadur's brother, Tapendra Bahadur Shah, who was an army general, facilitated the sale of the palace to the government.The original palace was a three-storey building 20 metres long and 16 metres wide, with 30 rooms. \nPrime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal lost his position on Friday, over one year and six months after his appointment, as he failed to secure a vote of confidence during a floor test in the House of Representatives.Dahal failed to secure the 138 votes required to endorse the trust motion as only 63 lawmakers voted in his favour in the 275-member House of Representatives. A total of 194 lawmakers voted against him, while a member cast a no vote. A total of 258 lawmakers were present in Friday’s meeting of the lower House.The prime minister opted for the floor test in accordance with Article 100(2) of the constitution after the CPN-UML withdrew its support to the government following a deal with the Nepali Congress to form a new coalition, reducing the Dahal-led government to a minority.Speaking at the Parliament while presenting the trust motion earlier in the morning, the prime minister said his party would not weaken the constitution and not allow others to do so.Stating that the constitution provides a month’s time for the prime minister to seek a vote of trust, he said the party under his leadership will consistently defend the constitution.“The Maoist Centre has made a big sacrifice in the course of making this constitution. Therefore, the Maoist does not make it weak and it also does not allow it to be enfeebled,\" said PM Dahal while addressing the House meeting. “This constitution made on the foundation of a decade-long revolt and the subsequent movements of the oppressed classes, regions, genders and communities has been protected taking the support of the people from the streets, and it will be defended in the same manner in the coming days as well.”It was the fifth floor test for the prime minister after being appointed prime minister on December 25, 2022.Dahal had gone for the floor test for the first time on January 10, 2023. He had received 268 votes then. The prime minister won the trust motion for the second time only three months later as he broke ties with the CPN-UML and forged an alliance with the Nepali Congress. He secured the support of 172 lawmakers at the time.He had to seek the vote of confidence for a third time after Congress withdrew its support to the government after Dahal again broke the alliance with Congress and joined hands with the CPN-UML and other parties on March 4. He had received 157 votes then.A split in the Janata Samajbadi Party, Nepal, in May of this year forced Dahal to face the floor again, where he secured the vote of confidence for the fourth time with 157 votes.President Ramchandra Paudel will now make a call for a new government formation. As soon as the prime minister fails the vote, Speaker Devraj Ghimire will inform President Paudel of the results. The UML is planning to claim the formation of a new government with the support of over two-thirds of the lawmakers. As per the understanding between Nepali Congress and UML, UML chair KP Sharma Oli will lead the new ‘national consensus government’ for a year and a half. For the remaining term of the present parliament, Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba will be the prime minister. \nPresident Ramchandra Paudel has entrusted the Pushpa Kamal Dahal government with the responsibility of carrying out its regular duties until a new government is formed.A statement issued by the Office of the President said President Paudel, as per Article 77 (3) of the constitution, has assigned the current government to carry out its tasks until a new government is in place.“The incumbent Cabinet has been entrusted with the responsibility of continuing its operations until a new Cabinet is formed,” read the statement. The President made the decision after the Speaker of the House of Representatives sent a letter to the Office of the President stating that Prime Minister Dahal’s motion was not endorsed by a majority.Prime Minister Dahal lost his position on Friday, over 18 months after his appointment, as he failed to secure a vote of confidence during a floor test in the House of Representatives.Dahal couldn’t secure the 138 votes required to endorse the trust motion as only 63 lawmakers voted in his favour in the 275-member House of Representatives. A total of 194 lawmakers voted against him, while a member cast a no vote. A total of 258 lawmakers were present in Friday’s meeting of the lower House.Soon after failing to secure a vote of confidence in the House of Representatives, Prime Minister Dahal met with President Paudel to inform him of the outcome. On Friday, Dahal moved from his official residence in Baluwatar to his private residence in Khumaltar. \nPresident Ramchandra Paudel on Friday called on members of the House of Representatives to stake claim for the post of prime minister showing a majority with the support of two or more political parties in the lower house.The Office of the President, in a statement, has called on the House members to present the majority through the support of parties represented in the lower house by Sunday evening.“The President, in accordance with Article 76 (2) of the constitution, calls on House of Representative members to show a majority in order to be appointed as the prime minister of Nepal with the support of two or more political parties of the House of Representatives by 5 pm on Sunday,” the statement reads.Prime Minister Puspa Kamal Dahal lost his position on Friday, over 18 months after his appointment, as he failed to secure a vote of confidence during a floor test in the House of Representatives.Dahal couldn’t secure the 138 votes required to endorse the trust motion as only 63 lawmakers voted in his favour in the 275-strong House of Representatives. A total of 194 lawmakers voted against him, while a member cast a no vote. A total of 258 lawmakers were present in Friday’s meeting of the lower House.With the President’s call, the Nepali Congress and the UML are all set to claim the prime ministerial post for UML chair KP Sharma Oli as per the deal the two parties reached on July 1.  \nUML Chairman KP Sharma Oli on Friday staked his claim to lead a new majority government as per Article 76 (2) of the constitution.Oli presented his claim before President Ramchandra Paudel with the support of 166 lawmakers, including 78 from his party and 88 from the Nepali Congress.Although fringe parties, including the Janata Samajbadi Party (JSP), JSP-Nepal, Loktantrik Samajbadi Party, Janamat Party and Nagarik Unmukti Party are in favour of the Congress-UML coalition government, Oli staked a claim showing the support of only UML and Congress to the President.“We have staked a claim for the new government before the President. Now, it’s up to him to decide when to make the appointment,” said Ramesh Lekhak, Congress chief whip.President Paudel earlier on Friday called on members of the House of Representatives to stake claim for the post of prime minister showing a majority with the support of two or more political parties in the lower house.The Office of the President, in a statement, has called on the House members to present the majority through the support of parties represented in the lower house by Sunday evening.“The President, in accordance with Article 76 (2) of the constitution, calls on House of Representative members to show a majority in order to be appointed as the prime minister of Nepal with the support of two or more political parties of the House of Representatives by 5 pm on Sunday,” the statement reads.The Article 76 (2) states that in cases where no party has a clear majority in the House of Representatives, the President shall appoint as the prime minister a member of the House of Representatives who can command majority with the support of two or more parties represented in the lower house.Prime Minister Puspa Kamal Dahal lost his position on Friday, over 18 months after his appointment, as he failed to secure a vote of confidence during a floor test in the House of Representatives.Dahal couldn’t secure the 138 votes required to endorse the trust motion as only 63 lawmakers voted in his favour in the 275-strong House of Representatives. A total of 194 lawmakers voted against him, while a member cast a no vote. A total of 258 lawmakers were present in Friday’s meeting of the lower House. \nPrime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is all set to go today. After being taken for a ride turn-by-turn by a distant third CPN (Maoist Centre) led by Dahal, the two big parties in Parliament—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—have joined hands to form a coalition government. And with this, Dahal, who remained at or around the power centre for almost a decade even with his party performing poorly in polls, is pushed to the periphery—at least for a while. The overzealous commentaries about Dahal being thrown off the grid of power may, however, be premature. As per the current constitutional provisions, coalition culture is here to stay. And considering how adamant the political parties are in sticking to their morally corrupt politics, no one can tell if the impending Congress-UML coalition stays for the next three months or three years. As Dahal goes today, there does not seem to be much point assessing how well his coalition with the UML fared in just four months of its existence. It takes decades, even centuries, to build a nation. The five-year term of Parliament is the minimum required for a set of leaders to make some impactful decisions for the country. There certainly are provisions for changes in the government, even in the midst of the parliamentary term, but these should be exceptional cases. What we have got, however, is a perpetuity of the coalition culture. It is this perpetuity that has halted the nation-building process for decades now. With the same set of three old men playing the hot potato game around power, nation-building has become a staccato performance at best. Just as one performer comes to the stage and starts his performance, he is pushed to the sidelines in the middle of the act.Pushpa Kamal Dahal will perform the last scene of the four-month act that was his coalition. He will come on stage, search for UML chairperson KP Sharma Oli among the audience, and call him a betrayer. He will then look for the Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba and blame him for being power-hungry. Oli and Deuba will then take the stage by turns and blame Dahal for trying to take them for fools. Such acts have been repeatedly performed, with the same set of plots, performances and actors. There is certainly a new actor on the block, a television presenter who thought he had had enough of shouting out of the small screen. He stepped out of the screen into the field and competed with the old guards whose noses he wanted to break—as his infamous saying went.The moment Rabi Lamichhane came to the spotlight after an impressive electoral showing, the masks he had worn all along started falling off. After a while, he became the fourth old man in the club of politicians who see fault in everyone else besides themselves. Only that Lamichhane was louder, more contemptuous of the media, and as directionless as the other three when it came to envisioning a future for the nation. As Dahal is forced to step down and Oli is about to take the helm, it is worth pondering if this sordid cycle of drama will end anytime soon.  \nThere is a growing public outcry over rampant corruption in Nepal. People believe that corruption is widespread and institutionalised and involves political parties, senior government officials, local elected representatives, business communities and civil societies. New scandals seem to emerge constantly, with the government stepping up efforts in some cases but arresting only a few individuals involved, who are released soon after. Only junior officials or ordinary individuals are charged and made accountable, sparing the key masterminds and those with influence, party leaders, or senior government officials.Given the scale, magnitude and possible involvement of the highest level of political leadership and their patronage in the scandals, the public’s concern is that the institutions established to control corruption have become dysfunctional with the meddling of senior party or government officials or prominent business people. These institutions are primarily headed by individuals with patronage from the political party leadership, who protect the perpetrators manipulating the institution’s functioning. Furthermore, given that we have a united government with continued political negotiations taking place, there may be threats to pull down the government if certain give-and-takes are not met; thus, it is unlikely that any action will be taken against anyone involved. Deputy Prime Minister and senior political leader Narayan Kaji Shrestha recently stated that if the political party members are accused of corruption, the party leadership will complain and threaten the government to pull out their support. If any civil servants are arrested, the protest comes from civil service unions with threats of street-wise demonstrations. Similarly, if those controlling the economy are accused of wrongdoing, they accuse the government of taking steps to destroy the economy. He stated that all political parties, government and business people are wary of punishing their groups of wrongdoers. He questioned whether the government should punish only ordinary people, street vendors, small businessmen, labourers, or poor people if this is the case. He emphasised that it is impossible to have a clean government without real unity and united efforts by all parties to address corruption. Failure in sustainable developmentA massive increase in corruption continues to threaten the country's overall development, including jobs, infrastructure, health, human development, quality of life for every citizen and overall governance. Employment opportunities are less available in the absence of foreign investments and new industries. Lest we forget, some 75,000-80,000 people leave the country every month, seeking employment abroad. The quality of education in government schools has deteriorated significantly, with only 36 percent passing the latest SEE. Around 100,000 students went abroad for studies in 2023-24 and will most likely not return home. Nepal is bound to lose a new generation of skilled and educated workforce. Reputated public hospitals have become dysfunctional due to the non-availability of medicine, non-functional equipment and the absence of qualified medical professionals, who are often frustrated by a lack of prospects and seek employment abroad. Many private hospitals and educational institutions have been established but are beyond the reach of the vast majority.None of the major road projects have been completed on time in recent years. They often double the timeline, overshoot the budget and use substandard work, resulting in substantial economic loss and prolonged inconvenience and suffering to citizens due to bad road conditions, dust pollution and long travel times. Government offices providing basic services, such as the issuance of driving licenses and passports, are notorious for delayed services.Major scandalsSeveral major scandals that have been in the limelight in the country include gold smuggling, Bhutanese refugee scams, land properties surrounding the PM Office, the Ncell/Axiata sale case, OMNI-Covid-related purchases, the Giribandu Tea Estate case, Cooperative scandals and many more involving hundreds of millions of dollars. The main concern is that the real culprits are walking free, as they are part of the political leadership or individuals with solid party connections. As The Kathmandu Post put it in its recent editorial, “Rotten to the Roots”, indicating high local level corruption and “representatives have copied the ways of their federal leaders”. It is reported that out of 28,000 cases filed by the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA), half of the cases were at the local units in one year. Several such officials were recently reportedly suspended, and thus the local institutions cannot function, potentially threatening the whole process of devolution of power from the centre. Whether local units seriously lack good governance and fiscal transparency also needs to be verified and acted upon.Partnership against corruptionIt is gratifying that Nepal enjoys good friendship and cooperation with many countries, multilateral organisations and the UN, which have been keenly supporting Nepal’s sustainable development, peace processes and democratic transformation. Twenty-five years into the democratic process, there have been significant achievements and friends of Nepal should be proud of their partnerships and cooperation. Nepal is very fortunate that around 26 percent of the annual government budget is supported by development partners. Nepal is at a turning point, with its citizens increasingly concerned about intuitional corruption and the cartel system. In the absence of serious political commitments and weakness in government institutions, the situation risks further deterioration. This situation goes against the people’s aspirations for the overall sustainable development of Nepal, with a threat to security, stability and hard-earned democracy, devolution of power to the local level and failure to achieve the country’s graduation from LDC status. In 2014, major development partners and the UN joined together to remind the Nepali government of their concern regarding rising corruption. Leakage in aid leads to a trust deficit among donors, who continue to develop their strategies and find their way of delivering aid at the cost of the overall impact of development support. Nepal has ratified the 2011 UN Convention Against Corruption, so the government should take all measures to fight corruption. The current situation strongly requires development partners and multilateral institutions, including the UN, to continue to voice their concerns about the institutionalisation of corruption and closely engage with the government in supporting anti-corruption measures on multiple fronts. The outcomes of these efforts will have significant impacts, giving rise to greater values in development aid and across different sectors. Way forward Nepal should ensure that its citizens trust its intentions regarding good governance processes, and all known scandals must be transparently resolved. All governance institutions, such as the CIAA, should be reviewed to make them more effective and fully accountable. Every government public service should be improved through digitisation and targeted timelines, including, for example, the delivery of all pending driving licenses. The development partners must raise concerns about corruption and support the government in strengthening its accountability and transparency process with a robust digital system and other technical assistance. The government should occasionally provide exclusive briefings to the public, media and development partners on the measures it is taking to control corruption.  \nFatal animal attractions between wild and domesticated species threaten both wildlife and herders in remote areas, highlighting the need for cohabitation solutions to protect endangered species and support Indigenous peoples' livelihoods.\nPM Modi's hug with Putin drew criticism, as India prioritizes military-industrial complex, facilitating return of Indian soldiers from Russia's Ukraine invasion, while Nepal struggles to repatriate its citizens.\nPresident Biden faces increasing calls from Democrats to abandon his re-election bid amid concerns over recent stumbles and low approval ratings, but remains adamant about running and recently attended a rally in Detroit.\nPyakuryal, a political analyst and academic, discusses Nepal's political instability, narratives, patriarchy, and future trends in Nepali politics.\nArvind Kejriwal, Delhi CM, granted interim bail in graft case but remains in jail due to another arrest.\nForeign Secretary Sewa Lamsal attended the Second BIMSTEC Foreign Ministers’ Retreat being held in New Delhi on Thursday.During the retreat session, Lamsal reaffirmed Nepal’s unwavering commitments to carry forward BIMSTEC process and stressed on enhanced collaborative efforts among member states to realise shared objectives of sustained peace, stability, and prosperity in the Bay of Bengal region. “She further emphasised that Nepal will continue pursuing a ‘whole of the region’ approach to harness resources for common benefits, strengthen institution-building processes, and transform BIMSTEC into an effective, results-oriented regional forum,” the Embassy of Nepal in New Delhi said.The foreign secretary also highlighted the importance of leveraging synergies of South Asia and South-East Asia to ensure tangible benefits to the people of the region and addressing pressing challenges including climate change, health-related pandemics, natural disasters and transnational organised crimes, reads the press release issued by the embassy.Lamsal also called on Indian Minister for External Affairs S Jaishankar and Hasan Mahmud, foreign minister of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh, separately. The discussions focused on various aspects of cordial and cooperative bilateral relations, including regional cooperation within the BIMSTEC forum.

Some have made clear Kyiv can use them to strike targets deep inside Russia while the United States has taken a narrower approach, allowing its weapons to be used only just inside Russia’s border against targets supporting Russian military operations in Ukraine.Biden told the press conference the United States had allowed Zelenskiy to use American weapons in a limited way within Russia’s borders.Biden said he and US military and intelligence officials were making decisions on “a day-to-day basis on how far they should go in. That’s a logical thing to do.’The United States and its allies have used this week's summit to try to project unity in the face of what they see as a rising threat to Europe from Russia and China.However, NATO member Hungary said ahead of a meeting of NATO members with partners from the so-called Indo-Pacific Four - Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea - that it does not want NATO to become an “anti-China” bloc, and will not support it doing so.Hungary’s Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto also told Hungarian state television that Ukraine’s admission to the military alliance would weaken unity in the group.Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban irked other NATO members with surprise visits to Kyiv, Moscow and Beijing in the past two weeks on a self-styled “peace mission”. He and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump will meet on Thursday at the latter’s Florida home, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.Orban’s meeting in Moscow with Russian President Vladimir Putin in particular angered some fellow NATO allies, who said the trip handed legitimacy to Putin’s claims to Ukrainian territory seized since Russia’s 2022 invasion.Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, told a public forum he would not speculate on whether Orban’s trip to Moscow was coordinated with Trump, Biden’s rival in the November US election, but said the Ukrainians had grave misgivings about any effort to negotiate a peace deal without them.“So whatever adventurism is being undertaken without Ukraine’s consent or support is not something that’s consistent with our policy, the foreign policy of the United States,” he said.ANGRY WORDS FROM CHINAWednesday’s NATO declaration included sharp words about China, calling it “a decisive enabler” of Russia’s war in Ukraine, and said Beijing continues to pose systemic challenges to Europe and to security.China’s Foreign Ministry said the declaration was biased and “sowing discord” and its mission to the European Union described it as being “full of Cold War mentality and belligerent rhetoric, and China-related content full of provocations, lies, incitement and smears.”At the news conference, Stoltenberg recalled language in the declaration by saying that “China cannot continue to fuel the largest military conflict in Europe without this impacting Beijing's interests and reputation.”China has repeatedly lashed out at NATO criticisms and has warned against its expansion into the Indo-Pacific.Japan, South Korea, New Zealand and Australia have forged stronger ties with NATO amid rising concerns over China’s pressure on rival claimants in disputed waters in the region and on democratic Taiwan, the global hub of cutting-edge chip production, which Beijing claims as its own. \nThe weather today will be generally to mostly cloudy throughout the country.Koshi, Madhesh, Bagmai, Gandaki and Lumbini provinces are expected to experience heavy to very heavy rainfall at a few places heavy rainfall has also been forecast at one or two places in Karnali and Sudurpaschim provinces.Light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is likely to occur across the country.The weather is likely to remain the same until later tonight.Heavy rainfall may continue in Koshi, Madhesh and Gandaki provinces while light rainfall is likely to occur in some places of Bagmati province.Dipayal recorded a maximum temperature of 35.7 degrees Celsius on Thursday while Jomsom had a minimum temperature of 15.5 degrees Celsius. \nImports from China to Nepal rose more sharply than expected in the first eleven months of the current fiscal year ending mid-June, while imports from India continued to tumble.According to the Trade and Export Promotion Center, the national trade promotion body, Nepal’s imports from China increased by 34.8 percent in the review period. In comparison, imports from India fell by 3.1 percent.Experts attributed ballooning imports from China to a sharp rise in the entry of electric vehicles (EVs). Likewise, a fall in imports from India has been attributed to the export curbs on food by the southern neighbour. In terms of value, imports from China increased by Rs70.44 billion to Rs272.81 billion in the review period.Import from India, however, dropped by Rs29.53 billion to Rs908.30 billion in the period.Due to the drop in imports from India, Nepal’s total imports declined 1.8 percent to Rs1.45 trillion in the first eleven months of the current fiscal year, which ended mid-June 2024.An official of the National Statistics Office says for a consumption-driven economy, falling imports are a worrisome sign. This suggests people are spending less on services and consumption while exports are stagnant.Rabindra Duwadi, the spokesperson at the Trade and Export Promotion Center, said imports from the north were driven by a massive influx of EVs, smartphones, and readymade garments.Besides, exports of iron, chemical fertiliser, apples and readymade garments too rose significantly. Traders said that China fulfils 80 percent of Nepal's readymade garment needs. The country imported readymade garments worth Rs33.67 billion in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year.In the same vein, Nepal imported 7,931 EVs worth Rs21.83 billion from China in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, up from 1,269 EVs worth Rs3.75 billion in the same period last fiscal year.Similarly, the country imported 1.23 million units of smartphones worth Rs17.27 billion from China in the review period. During the time, Nepal imported 99,965 tonnes of chemical fertiliser worth Rs8.69 billion from China.In the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, the country imported 65,827 tonnes of apples worth Rs6.98 billion from China, compared to 50,153 tonnes worth Rs4.73 billion in the same period last fiscal year.Duwadi said India’s share of Nepal’s total imports is 65.5 percent, while China contributes 18.8 percent. Traders say Nepal’s trade with India is vast, but it is steadily shifting to China. “One key reason for import growth from China is EVs,” said Rajan Sharma, a trade expert. “Chinese EVs are comparatively cheaper and perform better compared to Indian ones.” According to market observers, that’s why there has been an abrupt switch from India’s Tata Nexon EV to Chinese BYD.Sharma said readymade garments imported from China are cheaper compared to Indian readymade garments, including branded ones, which makes them popular among Nepali customers. “At the same time, India-made branded clothing items are expensive.”The Chinese Shein clothing brand has quickly gained popularity in Nepal due to its trendy clothes and reasonable prices.Trade experts say that due to the open border, there has been a massive rise in informal trade from India in recent years. Smuggling has thrived after India imposed a ban on foods.According to a research report titled, ‘Dynamics of informal cross-border trade in agricultural products between Nepal and India,’ prepared by South Asia Watch on Trade, Economics and Environment, only 40 percent of rice is imported from India through formal channels.India’s share in Nepal’s imports in formal trade is 60 percent, but the share of informal trade is likely to be higher.The research has pointed out that informal trade has thrived after the imposition of a 9 percent agriculture reform fee and a 2.5 percent advanced income tax, resulting in a total duty of 11.5 percent on rice imports.The paper said that India’s ban on rice and other agricultural exports has led to massive smuggling of food through the 1,800 km porous border between Nepal and India.Nepal is dependent on onions imported from India. When the Indian government imposed a ban on onion exports from December 2023 to May 2024, the product was readily available in the vegetable market and grocery stores, which indicated that a massive quantity of onions came through informal trade channels.The government did not take a single step to control the illegal trade or negotiate with the Indian government to ease the repeated bans on export of various agricultural goods. Nepal has thus lost out on huge import revenue as goods are coming to Nepal through illegal channels and are easily available in the market.Paras Kharel, executive director of the South Asia Watch on Trade, Economics and Environment, said overall imports have not been able to rebound in two fiscal years, reflecting the country’s economic slowdown. However, the rise in EV imports contributed to the sudden rise in imports from China.“Imports from Tatopani and Rasuwa customs rose by twice as much,” Kharel said. This shows that imports from China, which were halted after the Covid pandemic, are not gradually improving but are ballooning.According to the Department of Customs, the worth of imports from Tatopani customs increased to Rs37.16 billion in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, compared to Rs11.79 billion in the same period last fiscal year.Similarly, the worth of imports from Rasuwa customs on the northern border increased to Rs55.45 billion in the review period, up from Rs27.25 billion in the same period last fiscal year. \nThe National Human Rights Commission has said that the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act must include war crimes and crimes against humanity as serious violations of human rights while also ensuring justice to former Maoist child soldiers.The constitutional human rights watchdog made its position public as the three major parties worked to finalise the amendment bill to the Act under consideration in a parliamentary committee. Neither the existing Act nor the amendment bill includes war crimes, crimes against humanity and the issues of child combatants. In its report “The National Human Rights Commission and Transitional Justice”, the commission has said that together with murder, enforced disappearance, abduction or disappearances after the kidnapping, torture, rape or other sexual violence, war crimes and crimes against humanity should also be classified as non-amnestiable crimes.The 150-page report the commission is set to unveil on Monday includes its position on the long-pending transitional justice process while also documenting the efforts it made to deliver justice to the war-era victims of human rights violations. Since its establishment in 2002, the commission has investigated 1,073 cases related to the 1996-2006 insurgency and recommended actions against 222 including former Home Secretary and chief of Nepal Police.Following successive governments’ reluctance to follow its recommendations, the commission made public the list of perpetrators in October 2020 and January 2024.The leaders in negotiation are still struggling to finalise whether to list murder as a serious violation of human rights. Despite long negotiations, they have yet to sort out issues of minor Maoist soldiers and sentence reduction. They are also divided on whether victims who refuse to reconcile should be allowed to take their cases to court.The commission’s report says killing any unarmed individual, regardless of their involvement in the conflict, or those not directly involved in the fight, is a serious violation of human rights. There cannot be amnesty for serious violations of human rights, including war crimes and crimes against humanity. Amnesty for other human rights violations is possible only with the written consent of the victims, according to the commission.“Those who refuse pardon should be allowed to seek legal remedy as per the existing laws,” reads the report. “The truth and Reconciliation Commission must delve into the cases of the victims who lost their lives or got injured in landmines planted during the insurgency even after the peace process began.” Issues of child Maoist combatants must be addressed through the law to ensure they get justice, according to the commission.The use of minors in armed conflict is a war crime as per international law. The ruling Maoist Centre, therefore, does not want to include this issue in the law.During the verification process for army integration conducted by UNMIN in 2007, thousands of Maoist fighters had been disqualified for being minors. Among the 4,008 combatants who did not qualify for integration, 2,973 were verified as minors, while the remaining 1,035 had joined the Maoist ‘People’s Liberation Army’ after the first ceasefire of May 26, 2006—six months before the signing of the peace deal. The government had provided between Rs500,000 and Rs800,000 each to the combatants who chose voluntary retirement. However, those who were disqualified didn’t get any substantial support, except for a few thousand rupees from the United Nations.A group of former child soldiers led by Lenin Bista have filed a writ petition at the Supreme Court demanding the prosecution of the then Maoist supreme commander Pushpa Kamal Dahal, now the country’s prime minister, and the then ‘people’s government’ chief Baburam Bhattarai, who also is a former prime minister. The final hearing for the petition has been slated for September.Unlike in other issues, the commission has stood with the political parties on reduced sentencing. “The jail term of convicts who meet the criteria [perpetrators cooperating in the investigation process], can be reduced to a minimum of 25 percent as per existing laws,” reads the report. “The criteria for reduced sentencing can be defined in the law.” Surya Dhungel, a commissioner, said their position is based on international practice where reduced sentencing is common in transitional justice process.The commission has also reiterated that it will send its representative to the panel formed to recommend office bearers in the two transitional justice mechanisms only if there is a commitment from the parties concerned to amend the Act. “We are firm in our decision. Commitment from top political leadership is a must for the commission to send its representative to the recommendation committee,” said Dhungel. \nIn the early 1980s, Nepal’s firebrand communist leader, Mohan Bikram Singh, split from his comrade Nirmal Lama to establish a radical political alternative. Lama and Singh had earlier revolted from the Communist Party of Nepal to establish their own faction after the party’s fourth convention in 1974. Among Singh’s trusted leaders were Mohan Baidya, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, CP Gajurel and Dev Gurung. But Singh was forced to spend most of the following years politically exiled in India. As a result, Baidya effectively captured the party, renaming it the Communist Party of Nepal (CPN), “Mashal,” pronounced slightly different from Lama’s CPN “Masal.” However, Baidya and many senior party leaders faced self-imposed demotion after the party suffered a strategic setback in the now infamous ‘Sector Scandal’. Baidya was forced to nominate Dahal as the party leader in 1989, a position Dahal has held for three and a half decades.During the first two decades of his leadership, Dahal reigned supreme, as his party led the country into a decade-long violent political conflict that claimed, by some estimates, over 16,000 lives. Despite substantial economic and political costs, the conflict accelerated Nepal’s transition from a semi-feudal society with an exclusive political system into a more inclusive and secular republic. To that end, the Dahal-led Maoist party received due recognition through a popular mandate of the 2008 first Constituent Assembly elections. But Dahal’s unnecessary distrust of Nepal’s more established political parties, which had played a considerable role in bringing his party back into the political mainstream, made him commit blunders and unseated him from a comfortable majority government. His suspicion against fellow comrades who questioned his leadership style and decisions led to multiple splintering of the Maoist party. An insecure leaderDespite leading the country in and out of a transformative political conflict and becoming one of the key signatories of the new constitution, Dahal has remained an insecure leader who takes every opportunity to remind the Nepali people and the world about his “revolutionary contributions”. Possibly, this deep-seated insecurity emerges from the fact that he is neither seen as an intellectually gifted politician like his fellow comrade Baburam Bhattarai, who is known as an ideologue of the Maoist conflict or as a leader with integrity and simplicity like that of his political gurus Singh and Baidya. The thought of losing the political legacy of the ‘People’s War’ despite clinging onto the leadership of the party must constantly haunt the Maoist supremo.Dahal’s insecurity and political hypocrisy were also palpable in the way he derided the Madhesh Movement, which also raised the agendas of federalism and inclusion. Instead of considering them allies, Dahal ordered his party cadres to attack the Madheshi party leaders and their cadres. A large part of the political onus of escalating the tensions leading to the unfortunate Gaur massacre in 2007 will always rest on Dahal. Over the past decade and a half, Dahal has repeatedly failed to display the leadership he is ironically fond of discussing. Despite mobilising thousands of Tharu youths during the conflict, he failed to support their genuine claims on provincial boundaries during the federal structuring. And despite claims of his ‘one-sided love’ for Madhesh, he remained silent as more than 50 Madhesi protesters were indiscriminately killed by the security forces in 2015. Unreliable coalition partnerThere was a time when Dahal led a party that had shaken the country’s political core. Less than two decades later, he now leads a party that has mostly eroded its political base and only relies on a stronger coalition partner to remain relevant. But has Dahal even proved to be a reliable coalition partner? Let’s take a closer look. After Baidya split the party in 2012, the CPN-Maoist was reduced to the third position in the second Constituent Assembly elections, a significant loss from its commanding majority in the first CA. In the following two years, Dahal’s party was not only kept out of power but also forced to endorse a constitution that the Nepali Congress and rival communist party CPN-UML tabled. Having lost the capacity to dictate the political course, Dahal resorted to coalition politics. When the opportunity came, he supported UML’s Khadga Prasad Oli to cobble up a coalition government in October 2015. However, when the Nepali Congress offered him to lead a new coalition, he abandoned Oli and became Prime Minister in 2016. With the 2017 elections on the horizon, Dahal knew his party would not be able to compete with the larger parties that had successfully led the constitution drafting. With some active external mediation, Dahal persuaded Oli for an electoral alliance and even agreed to an eventual unification of the communist forces. When the left unity won a landslide victory, Dahal was convinced that Oli would honour the agreement to hand over power to him mid-way through the four-year period. When Oli refused, he split the united CPN in 2020, convincing several disgruntled leaders like Madhav Nepal to abandon the party and join a coalition with the Nepali Congress. The new coalition also offered Dahal and his party a comfortable division of electoral seats in the 2022 local, provincial and federal elections. But soon after the elections were over, Dahal bargained for power with both Deuba and Oli. Despite having won only 32 seats in the federal parliament with only 11 percent popular vote, Dahal managed to become Nepal’s 33rd Prime Minister in December 2022.Impending downfallIn 2014, political analyst CK Lal had told me that Dahal’s political opportunism would make him relevant in Nepali politics for at least another decade. The Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML took exactly a decade to realise that Dahal had been cashing in on Nepal’s fractured politics. This week, the two parties agreed that Nepal’s long-term political stability requires an introspection into the present electoral system, which allows electorally less popular outfits to dictate the course of national politics. So, not only have the two large parties decided to pull the plug on the Dahal government, but they also agreed to form an independent commission to study and propose amendments to the current electoral provision.While there is little disagreement that the current electoral system paved the way for more representation of the hitherto marginalised sections, the opportunity to correct inefficacies like expensive election campaigning and manipulation of the proportional candidacy lists by the parties must not be dismissed either. There are also serious doubts about the intention of the two parties to strike a deal at a time when the Nepal Police and the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority are investigating some high-profile corruption cases. It is up to the two parties to vindicate their intent by ensuring that the new political course does not interfere in these investigations. And even if the two parties agree to amend the constitutional provisions regarding elections, they will need to gather a national consensus or at least a two-thirds majority. Whatever happens in the next few weeks and months, it is evidently clear Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s eventual political downfall is on the horizon. \nIn 2019-20, Nepal imported 236 units of passenger electric vehicles (EVs) from China worth some Rs674 million. In the past five years, imports of EVs from China jumped 35 times, suggesting EV adoption in Nepal is now outpacing that of conventional combustion vehicles which use engines that burn fossil fuels, such as petrol or diesel. The EVs have overtaken conventional combustion vehicles.The imports of fossil fuel-consuming passenger vehicles were 10,310 units worth Rs9.24 billion in 2019-20. After four years, in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, imports of conventional combustion vehicles were down to 3,537 units worth Rs4.21 billionHowever, overall vehicle imports have jumped from Rs65.02 billion in 2019-20 to Rs80 billion in the first 11 months of 2023-24.According to the Department of Customs, Nepal imported 11,466 units of EVs worth Rs29 billion in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, or by mid-June. The imports were 3,870 units worth Rs11.23 billion in the same period last fiscal year. Of the total EV imports, a third came from China. Customs data show that Nepal imported 7,931 units of EVs from China, accounting for 69 percent of the total EV imports in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year. This translates to Rs21 billion in value.After China, the majority of EVs were imported from India. In the review period, imports from India amounted to Rs6 billion, or 3,277 units. Until the last fiscal year, India was Nepal’s top EV supplier.The data show that Nepal imported 2,205 EVs worth Rs5.94 billion from India in the last fiscal year. In the same period, imports from China were 1,269 units worth Rs3.75 billion.Nepal’s imports of EVs jumped sharply by 158.23 percent in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year. Importers say BYD, a Chinese multinational, has taken over the Nepali market. The government collected revenue of Rs13.06 billion from the import of EVs in the review period.Akash Golchha, senior vice president of the Nepal Automobile Dealers Association, said the ongoing economic slowdown has not stopped Nepalis from buying EVs. However, petrol or diesel-run vehicle sales could have been better.EV sales and orders saw a dramatic surge before the budget was announced on May 28. Cimex Inc Pvt Ltd, the authorised distributor of BYD Auto Industry Co Ltd in Nepal, said it had achieved a milestone by delivering 50 cutting-edge BYD EVs in a single day on May 18. According to the company, all 50 units were sold from its service centre at Guheshwari, Kathmandu.According to Cimex, the company imported 4,000 EVs in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year. The import of Chinese EVs is high due to their larger production compared to India, said the company, which is among the top EV brands in Nepal.BYD’s Atto and Dolphin are the most preferred models among Nepali customers. With the recent hike in excise and customs duties, the company said the new price list of BYDs will be unveiled soon.“There was fear among buyers that the government may raise duty on EVs in the budget. As a result, the demand surged dramatically,” said Golchha. “The high import increased the stock of EVs.”Automobile dealers said that the government hiked the duty on EVs by 10 percent in the budget for the coming fiscal year 2024-25, which, however, may not impact the sales.Golchha said the government did not make drastic changes in the import duty of EVs in the budget, which may help EV sales boom in the coming days. “The EV demand will grow at a faster pace.”Auto dealers say the import boost for EVs is mainly due to banks’ easy financing. Banks lend up to 90 percent of the vehicle’s cost.Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun, in the annual budget for the upcoming fiscal year, revised the customs and excise duty rates on the import of EVs. The customs duty on EVs of up to 50 kW has been increased to 15 percent from 10 percent, while a 5 percent excise duty has been imposed on them.Likewise, the government increased the customs and excise duties on EVs of 50-100 kW by 5 percent. As per the revised tariffs, the customs duty has been increased to 20 percent from 15 percent, while the excise duty has been increased to 15 percent from 10 percent.The customs duty on 100-200 kW has been raised to 30 percent from 20 percent. Similarly, those in categories 200-300 kW and more than 300 KW will be subject to customs duty of 60 percent and 80 percent, respectively. In these vehicles, the indirect tax has been raised by 20 percent each.According to EV traders, the market is flooded with various EV models, features, and looks, and customers have options to select according to their needs. They said that EVs ranging from Rs4 million to Rs5.5 million have a large customer base, while high-priced EVs are also seeing good sales.EV traders said that despite the market slowdown, the EV sector has not been affected.“One interesting emerging trend is that people who already own conventional combustion vehicles are also buying EVs,” said Golchha. \nOn May 28, presenting the financial plan for the upcoming fiscal year, Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun said all the 77 districts of the country are now connected by the national road network.But the ground reality is different.Without a bridge over the Karnali river at Chuwa Khola of Kharpunath rural municipality, Simkot, the district headquarters of Humla, remains to be connected to the national road network. Villagers in the northwestern corner of Nepal bordering Tibet in China where the Humla Karnali crosses face hardships in the absence of one bridge.Though the track was opened to Simkot in mid-April, the construction of the bridge has yet to be completed. As a result, a 12 km section still needs to be completed to connect the district headquarters.Now, vehicles carrying goods along the Karnali Corridor can only reach Kharpu. From there, the goods have to be transported by helicopters and carried over the river using cables, resulting in additional costs. This method, however, is possible only when the water level is low. Due to the lack of a bridge, around ten vehicles bought for government offices and passenger service via Surkhet were taken across the river using ropes and a bulldozer. The cars are now operating on the Simkot side.In 2007-08, the government announced in the annual budget that it would connect Simkot to the national road network. However, even after a decade and a half, Simkot is not connected to the national road network.In September 2021, the joint venture of Swachchhanda, Mount, and Pumori was awarded the Rs110 million contract for the bridge. The construction companies were issued Rs11 million in advance, and the project completion deadline was fixed in March this year.However, the company did not start the construction work for a long time, and around a year ago, it was necessary to change the design.“The joint venture company was responsible for constructing a 55-metre-long motorable truss bridge. But when the contractor started to dig the foundation, a hot water spring was found,” said Bel Bahadur Nepali, chief of the Simikot-Hilsa Road Construction Project. “The assessment showed that the bridge will not be durable if it is constructed on the existing design. So, we made the new design, which got approved two weeks ago. We will start the bridge construction work in July.”Nepali said that with the change in design, the contractor has been given a new deadline to complete the project: August 2025.Binod Kumar Pokharel, chief district officer, said the locals have demanded a Bailey or portable bridge as it may take time to complete the project. “Due to the lack of a bridge, the travellers are facing hassles. The passenger and goods transport charges too are high.”Pokharel said the river's flow is high throughout the year, so vehicles must be towed across the river with the help of an earthmover to Simkot. “To solve the problem, the locals have demanded a Bailey bridge. We are assessing the need.”Until last year, vehicles were operated from Khulalu of Kalikot towards Mugu-Bajura-Sillisalla of Humla. Nepali said that the 39 km road track was opened this year. This year, a 39-kilometre stretch was added. The project opened 8 km of the total track, and the Nepal Army did the work on the remaining 9 km section. The road from Khulalu of Kalikot to the Chinese border is 268 km long. Of this, 95 km south of Simkot is served by transportation. However, as the vehicle flow is breached by the lack of a bridge, passengers from Simkot to Khapunath rural municipality must change the vehicle by crossing suspension bridges on foot.Dan Bahadur Shahi, a senior citizen, said since there is no bridge, vehicles are charging higher fares. Jeeps run on the 12km Simkot-Kharpu stretch. The vehicle operators charge Rs700 to Rs1,000 per person as fare for a special arrangement called “reserve”. In similar fashion, the jeep operated from Kharpu via Sillisalli to Surkhet charges Rs7,000 per person, he said.“We are compelled to change the vehicle as there is no bridge. While crossing the river using the suspension bridge, we need to pay wages to a porter,” Shahi said. “If there were a bridge, we would be able to reach Surkhet by a single vehicle, and the fare would be less.”The price of daily consumable goods in Simkot is sky high, too. “No goods-carriers operate here; small jeeps are permitted to carry passengers only. This means we have to transport goods using porters so the prices refuse to come down,” said Bhim Bahadur Rokaya, a trader at Simkot.“There is no chance of prices falling unless a bridge is constructed across the Kharpu river, allowing for goods to be ferried by trucks,” Rokaya said.Pokharel said that because route permits are issued only from Khulalu of Kalikot to Sillisalli, fares are not fixed. “We have directed the Transport Management Office, Jumla, to manage the route permit and fare. The decision will be taken soon by a meeting of the transportation management committee.” \n\n\nSri Lanka’s rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences make it one of the world’s best holiday destinations. The most common sight across the island nation is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure—a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use. Despite being cash-strapped and plunging into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back, thanks to the growing number of tourists. We spent five days in the island country two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Following the trip spanning over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites, the Post presents a travel guide to Sri Lanka. \nDia Yonzon (she/her) is a writer and researcher. She runs The Melung Stories, a platform dedicated to amplifying the literary and artistic expressions of queer and indigenous communities. Yonzon is also affiliated with the Writing Center at the Open Institute of Social Science.In this conversation with the Post’s Rishika Dhakal, Yonzon talks about queer literature, her work at UN Women Nepal, and the books that have influenced her.How has your background in law and arts influenced your approach to advocacy and activism at UN Women Nepal?I worked at the UN Women Nepal for three years. My background in law had a direct influence on my work. However, I never wanted to become a practising lawyer; I just wanted to understand the philosophy of law. While studying law, I gravitated towards the field of human rights.Currently, I am involved in creating art and literature. I realised that when we need to say something in society, more than logistics and data, what touches people’s hearts is art. It is because art shapes us in subtle ways, knowingly or unknowingly.Reading feminist literature has also shaped my activism. So, everything I do has been shaped by the books I read. For example, many people dismiss ‘Pride and Prejudice’ as cheap literature. But once you read the book, you will find that Jane Austen provided satirical commentary on the era in which she was born.Even today, we tend to dismiss literature. Art and literature provide a subtle glimpse of the contemporary world.The first book that made a significant impact on you and why?I mostly write about how time and space affect love. As a child, I remember reading ‘The Time Traveller’s Wife’, the first book I purchased with pocket money.And now that I think about it, the book significantly influenced me because I am a sucker for romance. The story centres on a timeless love that transcends specific moments and places. This one component resonated with me.But as my writing grew, I realised it didn’t necessarily have to be about sci-fi. I write about general things, such as how people express love. I developed that by reading ‘The Time Traveller’s Wife’.In your experience, how important is queer literature for the representation and empowerment of queer individuals?While growing up, I didn’t see much mainstream literature that had queer representation. This made me feel like I was some sort of outcast. And it wasn’t just me who felt this way; others did, too. You want to feel you are being represented. During my childhood, there was only one mainstream memoir about a gay person that I remember. Nepali literature should be more diverse. As it will allow young people from such communities to feel like they are being represented. The greater the presence of queer literature, the more normalised it will become.Currently, the representation of queer people is disheartening, often depicting their lives as solely filled with suffering. By discussing the various dimensions of queer life, including joy and sadness, we can normalise these experiences. This helps non-queer allies to relate and understand better.One of my major concerns is that we only have access to popular media, which limits our understanding of contemporary society in the past. For queer people, this is especially troubling because there are no reference points to learn about their experiences and situations back then.Decades ago, queerness was vilified. Films like ‘Chandigarh Kare Aashiqui’, reflect minor narrative shifts in our society, even if they are misguided portrayals of the experiences of queer people.Compared to the past, many people today are discussing queerness, indicating a significant societal shift. This is why it is crucial to write more queer stories now. From a documentary and archival perspective, these stories will be invaluable for understanding the experiences of queer people in the future.As someone who is into fiction, how do you think it can contribute to understanding social issues?Fiction reflects contemporary society and its conversations, ultimately allowing us to address various prevalent issues. In fiction, if you’re a man reading a novel with a female protagonist, you can immerse yourself in the protagonist’s experience. Because fiction is a story, it isn’t necessarily preachy. It doesn’t order people to do this or that. Instead, it builds a world and invites people to explore it. No subject is one-dimensional, so it allows you to explore everything. Speculative fiction lets us see what might happen if we continue on a certain path.By capturing all the small nuances of society in the story, we can amplify and highlight issues that have not received the attention they deserve.What books would you recommend to non-queer allies who want to better understand and support queer communities?Many smaller publications help in aiding one's understanding of queerness. Recently, we conducted a 10-day residency titled ‘A Room of One’s Own’. The UN, Katha Satha, and the Open Institute supported the residency. At the end of it, we published a book of the same title. One can follow magazines like ‘Queerbad’ by the Queer Muslim Project (TQMP), which features stories written by queer writers from South Asia. Similarly, the ‘A Room of One’s Own: Queer Writer’s Residency’ publication can also be followed. Additionally, small independent zines such as ‘A Song of Revolution’ from Nepal should be considered.For more accessible reads, I recommend Niranjan Kunwar’s ‘Between Queens and the Cities’ and ‘Beyond the Gender Binary’ by Alok Vaid-Menon. Ocean Vuong's ‘On Earth, We’re Briefly Gorgeous’ is also an excellent work of fiction that provides insight into queer experiences.Can you share about the Melung stories writing workshop? How do these workshops contribute to the queer and indigenous literary community?Melung Stories is a storytelling platform. They document and archive stories of queer people. Writing is not seen as a lucrative job. Even if one chooses to be a writer, they need a community. The community I speak of includes editors, readers, and publishers who will support you. Plus, there is no certainty that it will pay you. In that context, many people who belong to indigenous or marginalised communities avoid writing and instead take up stable jobs that pay well. So, who ends up writing? Folks who already have resources, have generational wealth or can make time for themselves. In our workshop, we target queer and indigenous people. We want to give them resources, time, space, guidance, and a certain agency. There are lots of people who want to share their stories but don’t have the time or the space to do so. So, in Melung stories, we give them time and space. And their stories get recorded. How do you envision the future of queer literature and representation in Nepal?When discussing art and literature, we assume they are void of societal issues. This is because the language we use to discuss them is sophisticated. However, art and literature are not created in a vacuum. They feed off of society and reflect the society we live in. Nepal and South Asia need more diverse voices to tell authentic and meaningful queer stories. Queer literature shouldn’t be limited to biographies and memoirs; it can include fiction, biography, or sci-fi to reach a broader audience. Queer books shouldn’t be treated as rare treasures but should be made widely accessible.Diya Yonzon’s book recommendationsThe God of Small ThingsAuthor: Arundhati RoyPublisher: Random HouseYear: 1997The book tells the story of two fraternal twins.

GB Rai, who is at large, is believed to have fled the country.In its terms of reference (ToR), the committee has divided the cooperatives it has to investigate into two categories. It has listed the 20 cooperatives declared problematic ones by the government’s Crisis-ridden Cooperatives Management Committee in its schedule 1 and nine others including those linked to the Gorkha Media Network in the schedule 2.The committee had planned to first listen to the victims who deposited money in the cooperatives listed in the schedule 1 and then move on to schedule 2.After listening to the cooperative victims’ grievances on Wednesday, the committee members decided to hold discussions on the cooperatives listed in the schedule 2.“Soon, the parliamentary special probe committee will start discussion on the fourth point [that mentions the schedule 2],” Lekh Nath Dahal, a member of the parliamentary special probe committee, told the Post.As per the ToR, the probe panel will conduct a study and make recommendations on resolving legal and institutional issues faced by cooperatives and on regulations, supervision, and transparency of their financial systems.Coordinators of various struggle committees formed by cooperative victims were also present during the discussion. Chair of the parliamentary probe panel, Surya Thapa, a lawmaker from CPN-UML, said that they invited the representatives to listen to their grievances as the victims’ suggestions would be crucial in reaching a conclusion on the matter.Speaking in a discussion with the House committee, Shaligram Duwadi, a victim of Sahara Multi-Purpose Cooperatives from Chitwan, said that Rs510 million was rerouted from the cooperative to the Gorkha Media Network.“We tried to lodge the complaint against Gorkha Media Network with Chitwan Police but they refused to register our complaint after they saw the name of Gorkha Media Network,” Duwadi was quoted as saying by a member of the special probe committee. “Why was the case not registered by Chitwan Police?”Likewise, the committee member said Krishna Pariyar, a cooperative victim of Swarnalaxmi Saving and Credit Cooperative of Kathmandu, also accused Home Minister Lamichhane of abusing state power by not letting him withdraw his money and cash his cheque.“Though the victims of many cooperatives were present in the meeting today [Wednesday], the discussion was more focused on the chairman and managing director of Gorkha Media Network,” said the committee member.According to the committee member, the victims stressed that no matter how powerful these two people [Rai and Lamichhane] are, they should be booked under the law.The parliamentary special probe committee invited representatives from 29 cooperatives mentioned in the ToR but most of those present at the meeting were victims from the cooperatives linked to the media company, according to committee members.“Though victims from other cooperatives were also present at the committee meeting, most of them were those whose money was embezzled by the Gorkha Media Network,” Ishwari Devi Neupane, a probe committee member representing Nepali Congress, told the Post. Listed under schedule 2 of the ToR or linked to the media company are: the Ideal Yamuna Multipurpose Cooperative, the Image Saving and Credit Cooperative, the Sahara Saving and Cooperative, the Samanata Saving and Credit Cooperative, the Sano Paila Saving and Credit Cooperative, the Supreme Saving and Credit Cooperative, the Suryadarshan Saving and Credit Cooperative, the Sumeru Saving and Credit Cooperative and the Swarnalaxmi Saving and Credit Cooperative.Reportedly, money from Butwal-based Supreme Saving and Credit Cooperative, Suryadarshan Saving and Credit and Cooperative of Pokhara, Sahara Saving and Cooperative of Chitwan, Swarnalaxmi Saving and Credit Cooperative of Kathmandu, Sano Paila Saving and Credit Cooperative of Birgunj, and Nepalgunj’s Samantha Saving and Credit Cooperative has been rerouted to the Gorkha Media Network.Before this, the committee held discussions with top government officials including Secretary of the Ministry of Home Affairs Ek Narayan Aryal and Inspector General of Police (IGP) Basanta Bahadur Kunwar, among other officials, on July 4 to discuss the cooperatives under investigation.On the same day, Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) Chief Shyam Gyawali and Crime Investigation Department Chief Tek Bahadur Tamang were also called for the discussion.As per a probe committee member, some committee members grilled IGP Kunwar about his previous statement in the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee. Speaking at the parliamentary committee in the last week of March, the Nepal Police chief had claimed that police had found no evidence of Home Minister Lamichhane’s involvement in cooperative fraud.“When I made the statement in the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee about the home minister, his involvement in the scam had not been disclosed,” a committee member quoted IGP Kunwar as saying at the special committee meeting. Another member of the probe committee, Shishir Khanal, said the IGP said he was not under any pressure to give a statement about Home Minister Lamichhane. Khanal is a lawmaker from the Lamichhane-led Rastriya Swatantra Party.“The IGP said that he spoke on the basis of facts and that no information regarding Home Minister Lamichhane’s involvement in the cooperatives scam had been found till the day he made the statement.”Also, the committee held discussions with chiefs and representatives of various panels formed since 1990 to probe irregularities in the cooperative sector.The parliamentary special panel will make recommendations on safeguarding depositors’ savings, and quick and easy refunds for victims whose deposits have been embezzled.The panel also agreed to probe crisis-ridden cooperatives and fast-track the refund process for the depositors of the cooperatives concerned.The parliamentary special probe committee began its work a month ago after a month-long discussion with top officials from government agencies as well as chiefs and members of various panels formed so far by the government to look into problems involving cooperatives. \nPrime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal has said that CPN-UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli had hatched a conspiracy against him and the government and joined hands with the Nepali Congress to form a new coalition by dismantling the UML-Maoist Centre alliance prematurely.The four-month-long partnership between Dahal and Oli collapsed after the UML chief sealed a yet-to-be-disclosed seven-point agreement with Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba on the midnight of July 2. Speaking at a meeting of the Maoist Centre’s parliamentary committee on Wednesday, the embattled prime minister accused Oli of betraying him. After the UML recalled its ministers from the Dahal Cabinet and withdrew its support to the government, Dahal is seeking the vote of confidence in the House of Representatives on Friday.“Oli betrayed me for no reason,” said Dahal. “We came to know that the Nepali Congress and the UML were inching towards a political deal but Oli lied to me several times about it.”On the morning of July 2, Dahal and Oli had a three-hour-long conversation at his residence in Baluwatar but Oli did not tell him the truth about what he had agreed with Deuba. “If you are going to become the prime minister with the support of Nepali Congress, I will quit and help you,” Dahal shared with the party’s lawmakers about what he had told Oli. But Oli had flatly denied having reached an agreement with the Congress, according to Maoist leaders.Hitraj Pandey, the chief whip of the Maoist Centre, quoted Dahal as saying that Oli did not want to inform him about the deal with Deuba. According to Congress and UML leaders, Deuba, Oli and second rank leaders of both parties had met regularly for months ahead of the July 2 deal.After second-rank leaders worked out the fundamentals of the new political deal and power-sharing, Deuba and Oli gave it a final touch at midnight on July 2 at the residence of a businessman.Dahal and Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Rabi Lamichhane have been claiming that after the arrest of Bechan Jha in the fake Bhutanese refugee case, Deuba and Oli joined forces in order to protect some of their close aides and family members. According to Nepal Police officials, Jha, who claimed to be an influential power broker, had established good connections with top Congress and UML leaders. Citing their initial findings of interrogation with other suspects they had arrested, police said individuals had given millions of rupees to Jha to facilitate their travel to the United States on the guise of Bhutanese refugees. Some of the accused who masterminded the fake Bhutanese refugee scam are in police custody. Jha’s arrest made the Congress and UML leaders fearful of being arrested, said the Maoist and Swatantra Party leaders. Briefing his party’s lawmakers, Dahal said that he then telephoned Deuba to know what exactly had happened between them. Deuba’s reply was that he and Oli had already reached a deal. He reportedly turned down Dahal's offer to lead the government, according to Pandey.But UML leaders, including their general secretary Shankar Pokhrel, Deputy General Secretary Pradeep Gyawali and others, claimed that after Dahal returned from New Delhi, he started negotiations for new government formation with Deuba and offered him the leadership of a national government.“After we came to know that the prime minister was hatching a conspiracy and going to destabilise the country's politics by changing the ruling partners, we decided to initiate talks with the Congress for the sake of forming a stable government, giving people hope and amending some constitutional provisions,” UMl leaders said. Dahal returned from New Delhi on June 10 after attending the swearing-in ceremony of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Dahal is seeking a vote of confidence on Friday. On Wednesday, the Nagarik Unmukti Party also decided to withdraw the support extended to the Dahal government. The government has already been reduced to a minority after the UML pulled the plug on it last week.“We will talk to all political parties and seek their support,” said Pandey, the Maoist Centre chief whip. The prime minister will mull his resignation only after the vote of trust in the House, said Pandey. Dahal, who was elected prime minister as per Article 76 (2) of the constitution, claims that the next government will be formed as per Article 76 (3) of the constitution. If the President upholds the spirit of the constitution, he should call for new government formation as per Article 76 (3), Pandey said. \nFormer prime minister and CPN-UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli, who is set to become prime minister next week, defended his seven-point deal with Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba. However, Oli said that the intricacies of constitutional amendments, which the two largest parties have reportedly agreed to in principle, have yet to be finalised.Speaking at a meeting of the party’s secretariat on Wednesday, Oli said that the two parties have agreed to the need to amend the constitution to protect national interests, make Nepal prosperous and the Nepalis happy, but the details have not been worked out.Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is set to go for a floor test on Friday after the UML and some other coalition partners withdrew their support to the government. As per the agreement reached between Deuba and Oli on July 2, the UML chair will become the prime minister early next week.Giving reasons why the first and second largest parties in the House of Representatives had come together for government formation, Oli stated that the current tendencies to allow private and partisan interests to dominate state affairs, and fringe parties with few lawmakers claiming the post of chief minister and their unusual manoeuvrings needed to be defeated by the partnership of the two parties.Deuba has already endorsed Oli as the next prime minister. The two parties will have a more or less equal number of Cabinet ministers, though they have yet to enter into the power-sharing deal.“Some are trying to create an illusion about the agreements signed between the Nepali Congress and the UML. Some were trying to pay their lip service to amending the constitution, but they actually engaged in making the constitution a failure. In due course of time some constitutional provisions should be revisited, so we have stressed the need for amendments,” said Oli.After the meeting, UML deputy general secretary Pradeep Gyawali said the statements made by Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane were not true. After the government decided to open more cases of corruption targeting top leaders of the Congress and the UML, the two parties came together overnight to topple the government, Dahal and Lamichhane have said publicly.But that is merely a political stunt, said Gyawali. Who stopped them from opening corruption cases in the last four months?“Prachanda ji had been in the government for 10 months [until he pushed the Congress out of the coalition], but what stopped him from opening the corruption cases? Rabi ji became the minister for six months over two terms. What stopped him from investigating the cases?” Gyawali asked. “These are only stunts. After failing to run the country and the government [effectively], they need some excuse which they are making. They kept saying this in the past week.”There is a large section, including the CPN (Maoist Centre) and others, that has critically taken the issue of charter amendment. But we have not discussed which constitutional provisions will go for the changes, he said. Those constitutional reforms will be based on the experience of a decade. The constitution was promulgated in September 2015. The agreement between the Congress and UML to amend it has made the political fraternity and activists and observers curious.No agreement has been reached on who will lead the commission that will suggest amending and reforming the constitutional provisions, he added.“Some are trying to create an illusion after the Nepali Congress and the UML came up with a deal. They are also saying that the agreement has taken the constitution towards anarchy, political instability and confusion. We see the governments in provinces are changing frequently or every month. Private and partisan interests dominated, instability and bargaining were rampant, and parties frequently changed the camps,” Oli shared his observation. “Development activities, necessities and requirements of the people had never been at the centre, but corruption and instability were dominated and rampant. So, how can we stop such a tendency? That is why we, the Nepali Congress and the UML, came together,” said Oli.Any attempt to fail the constitution, and weaken federalism is not accepted, he said the constitution is the dynamic document; it should guide society so the constitution should be amended as per the context of the time. Oli is all set to become the prime minister by early next week, but the Nepali Congress and UML have not settled the power-sharing deal, including the division of the ministerial portfolio, according to Oli.Oli said the power-sharing deal will be concrete only after the new government takes shape. “We will try to bring more parties into the government. We are in discussion with them. In general, the allocation of the ministries will be made as per the strength of the political party,” he added.The division of ministerial portfolios will be decided only after Friday or after Prime Minister Dahal fails to get the vote of confidence in the House of Representatives.The UML has issued a whip to all its lawmakers to vote against Dahal on Friday.Oli told the party meeting that smaller parties are also likely to join his government, according to one UML leader. There was a general understanding between the Congress and the UML of dividing 19 ministries between them.From the UML, Bishnu Poudel will be in the government as the finance minister. But there is no decision in the Congress on who will lead the party’s ministers in the Oli cabinet. It could be the party general secretary Gagan Thapa or one among senior leaders like Krishna Prasad Sitaula and Prakash Man Singh. Deuba wants Ramesh Lekhak to serve as the home minister, a leader close to the party president said.Oli is in a mood to form a governing team of both experienced and new faces, UML leaders said. Choosing ministers is more difficult for Deuba due to multiple power centres in the party led by Thapa, Sitaula, Singh and Shekhar Koirala. There is also the need to balance gender, region, and ethnic clusters in the party’s picks.The Congress has already endorsed the two-party deal. Oli is tipped to lead a ‘national consensus government’ for a year and a half, before handing the reins over to Deuba who will lead the administration until the general elections in 2027.Deuba and Oli have also agreed to review the electoral system, proportional representation, the composition of the National Assembly, and the size of provincial assemblies. The Congress and the UML will lead three provincial governments each, leaving the provincial government in Madhesh that is led by CK Raut’s Janamat Party. \nIn a bid to lessen the spread of the dengue virus during the ongoing monsoon season, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City has decided to continue the drive to destroy mosquito larvae and breeding grounds. Officials at the health department of the city office said on Friday that they have just completed a week-long drive in all 32 wards of the metropolis and plan to continue these efforts in the coming days as well.“Every Wednesday, our health volunteers will visit households and open spaces to destroy mosquito breeding grounds,” said Rishi Bhusal, epidemic prevention and control focal person at the metropolis. “Decisions on preventive measures including launching search and destroy drives will depend on the spread of virus and intensity of rainfall in the coming days.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vectors also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus, according to the World Health Organisation.According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,268 people from 72 districts have been infected with the dengue virus since January this year. Among the 72 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases: 141. Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and can be treated with paracetamol at home.Dengue symptoms include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes. Patients with these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and proper medical care can prevent death.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district. Since then, an increasing number of dengue infections have been reported from many districts, including major dengue outbreaks. Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Though the post-monsoon period is considered the dengue epidemic season, the deadly disease has already become endemic in Nepal, as outbreaks of the virus are reported every month, including in the winter months.Officials at the health department said that 654 health workers, including female community health volunteers, were deployed in the week-long campaign, which concluded on Friday.“Volunteers and health workers who were deployed to the door-to-door campaign checked the mosquito breeding grounds and the larvae, made people aware about the risks and destroyed the breeding grounds,” said Bhusal. Health workers reported that storage places for scrap materials, discarded cups, and plastic in open spaces, and unused lands as potential hotspots for the dengue virus in the coming days. Health workers have warned owners of these sites that action will be taken if mosquito larvae are found against the owner of the storage place if mosquito larvae were found.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects, such as plastic cups and bottles, could be breeding grounds for these mosquitoes.Public health experts say now is the right time to prepare for and prevent possible outbreaks. Health ministry officials said they have alerted all related agencies to the risk of a dengue outbreak. \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City has imparted mental health screening training to doctors and paramedics serving at urban health promotion centres.Officials at the Health Department in the metropolis hope that the move will help hundreds of patients with mental health issues in the city to get timely treatment.“Getting free treatment for mental health problems comes under the right to get free basic health care services,” said Sajina Maharjan, acting head of the department. “Mental health problem screening training to doctors and paramedics will help in the timely diagnosis of the problems and start of early treatment.”At least 32 doctors serving at the urban health promotion centres under the city office and dozens of paramedics participated in five-day screening training. The metropolis has upgraded its urban health clinics to urban health promotion centres and started providing services through medical doctors. “Due to the lack of doctors at our urban health promotion centres, patients suffering from mental health problems have been deprived of timely treatment,” said Nali Bajracharya, a senior public health officer at the department. “Now patients having mental health issues and seeking care at our health centres will also get mental health treatment.”Though neither the federal government agency nor the city office has data on the number of people suffering from mental health problems in the metropolis, doctors estimated that a lot of people could be suffering from various forms of mental health problems—anxiety, depression and others.Officials say that they are also planning to provide free medication to patients with mental health problems.Health workers say that many city dwellers, despite having mental health problems, do not seek treatment and instead turn to drugs and substances to cope. Due to the entrenched social stigma, fear of discrimination and other factors, many patients in Nepal do not talk about their mental health issues.The general tendency among people to conceal mental health issues due to the stigma attached to it has also forced patients to opt for substance abuse, doctors say.They say that while drugs and alcohol may provide temporary relief from stress, they are not a solution and can adversely affect mental health and well-being in the long run.“Treatment in the initial stage of mental illness helps patients achieve better results. For that, early diagnosis is crucial,” said Dr Pomawati Thapa, chief of the Non-communicable Disease and Mental Health Section at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Other local units should also follow the initiative to provide mental health screening training to health workers, including doctors.”Nepal is among the countries with highest rates of suicide, which is an extreme manifestation of a mental health problem.According to Nepal Police data, 6,993 people took their own lives in the fiscal year 2022-2023. This accounts for more than 19 deaths on average daily. Fifty-six percent of those who die by suicide are men.Doctors say that people do not attempt suicide for a single reason, but due to a complex situation arising from multiple problems.An increasing number of people are struggling with mental problems owing to the rising cost of living and the struggle to manage even their most basic needs, such as food, housing, healthcare and jobs, experts say.Whatever the cause, suicides and suicide attempts have a ripple effect, impacting families, friends, colleagues, communities and societies, doctors say.A study carried out by the Nepal Health Research Council in the past shows that about 13 percent of Nepalis suffer from some form of mental disorder. This means around one in eight Nepalis has mental health issues. Moreover, the country simply does not have enough experts to treat mental health problems, it added.Studies show the magnitude of suffering, the burden and costs for individuals, families and societies arising from mental health disorders are alarming in Nepal.“No doubt, mental health problems have been emerging as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in our country,” said Thapa. “All local governments must take initiative to address the problems. Only the federal government agencies cannot do much.”The World Health Organisation says that one in four people in the world has been affected by mental or neurological disorders at some point in their lives, and around 450 million people currently suffer from such conditions, placing mental disorders among the leading causes of ill health and disability worldwide. \nDuring the 2022 local level election, people of Kathmandu elected independent candidate Balendra Shah as their mayor for five years. Sunita Dangol of the CPN-UML secured the position of KMC deputy mayor in the same election. When they began their term, many suspected that the two—an independent mayor and his party-affiliated deputy—wouldn’t have cordial relations. But, in the last two years of their term, there has been no visible disagreement between them. They proved their sceptics wrong.Deputy Mayor Dangol kept mum when Mayor Shah accused her party chair, KP Sharma Oli, of policy corruption in the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate land scam.Moreover, Shah expressed his anger on June 3 over the government’s intervention in his plan to widen pavements in the New Road area. Deputy Prime Minister Raghubir Mahaseth of the UML leads the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, which maintains major roads.After the ministry intervened in the municipal plan to expand the sidewalk on New Road, Shah took to social media and wrote, “Honourable KP Oli jyu, don’t hoodwink people by engineering yet another scam to hide a scam of Rs10,000 crore [Rs100 billion].”He further added, “You have reassured those who had made advance payments to buy land of Giri Bandhu Tea Estate that they would get the land within two years.” “If one looks at the policy corruption in the tea estate, it appears not a single leaf would stir without Oli’s nod,” Shah wrote.A few days prior to the incident, Mayor Shah had engaged in a heated debate with Chinkaji Maharjan, a UML member and chairman of KMC’s ward 22, over the sidewalk expansion plan.Dangol remained quiet on the issue thus far. However, at the city council meeting on Monday, which also discussed KMC's policies and programmes for the fiscal year 2024-25, she criticised Mayor Shah for his remarks.“This should be the first time the deputy mayor opposed the public behavior and statement of the mayor,” a Kathmandu ward chairperson told the Post on the condition of anonymity.Dangol had her initial plan to contest the mayor position independently but the UML gave her the deputy mayor’s ticket.Speaking during the Monday discussion, Deputy Mayor Dangol said, addressing Mayor Shah, “Your and mine voices are being heard and watched by Nepalis worldwide. Therefore, those of us who want to come to politics should think about our expression,” Dangol remarked. “We should maintain the image and dignity of the institution we represent.”She also emphasised the need to accommodate the voices of everyone in an undertaking.Though the representatives of Kathmandu Metropolitan City claim that Dangol's Monday statement was unusual, they deny any rift between the two leaders of the local government. “City council’s is an internal meeting of the KMC where various issues arise. We settle those issues internally,” Nabin Manandhar, the KMC spokesperson and ward 17 chairman from the Nepali Congress, told the Post. “Having an opinion does not necessarily mean criticism.”Rajesh Kumar Shrestha, chair of KMC ward 19, seconded Manandhar.However, local representatives of Kathmandu have been questioning Shah for his ‘lone-wolf’ manner of leading the institution.“We should develop a working relationship that welcomes everyone’s spirit,” Dangol told the council meeting. “If one thinks they are in a position and everything should be done as they say, it will only lead to trouble.”She added, “While working in a team, we definitely have a different opinion, but different opinions should be respected.”At the meeting, referring to Mayor Shah's past statements, council member Anita Karki asked him, saying, “What if the voters of Kathmandu set ablaze the Durbar where the KMC office lies?”In September last year, when the traffic police obstructed a KMC vehicle, later known to be used by his postpartum wife, Mayor Shah provocatively wrote on Facebook, threatening to burn Singha Durbar, the federal government’s central secretariat.Traffic police, under the federal government, had stopped the vehicle to check necessary documents on a Saturday.After the incident, Shah wrote on social media warning that if the government blocked KMC's vehicles again, he would set fire to Singha Durbar.Dangol said on Monday that she believed it was wrong to write on social media or make a statement inciting people to burn the Singha Durbar or the Bagh Durbar, where the KMC office is situated.Dangol, speaking at the city council meeting, also said there should be no polarisation between the representatives who were elected to develop Kathmandu. \nA police officer was found dead on the premises of the federal parliament building in Baneshwar, Kathmandu on Wednesday.According to Ekram Giri, spokesperson for the federal parliament secretariat, Ajit Gole of Dolakha committed suicide by shooting himself.The body of the victim was recovered from the parliament building’s washroom.Dinesh Mainali, spokesperson for the Kathmandu Metro Police Range, said Gole, who was on duty from 6am to 10am, was found dead at around 8 in the morning. “A constable of Nepal Police was found dead inside a toilet of the parliament building,” Mainali told the Post. “Preliminary investigation shows he was inflicted with a gunshot.”Nepal police said the investigation is underway. \nPolice on Friday arrested two people from Thimi of Bhaktapur for allegedly mining cryptocurrency.The Central Investigation Bureau took 50-year-old Biswas Gurung and Rajendra Tahamata, 25, into custody in connection with the crime, said Hobindra Bogati, spokesperson for the bureau.The duo allegedly ran mining operations from the CTEVT’s information technology lab using a server and 64 desktops, on which blockchain applications were found during a preliminary investigation. Further investigation into the matter is underway. \nKot Ghar, once considered the seat of powerful Malla kings of Galkot, a pretty kingdom in the confederation of 24 states known as Chaubisi Rajya, has been restored and preserved to draw tourists.The Kot Ghar means a house where weapons are placed or stored. The town of Galkot once served as the fortress of the hilly kingdom ruled by the Mallas. The historical palace, which has been renovated, offers a reason to visit Galkot.Before the Panchayat era, Galkot served as Baglung's headquarters. Without the administrative offices, the locals seek to make Galkot the tourism headquarters of Baglung.According to history, Jitari Malla, the elder son of King Narayan Malla of Parbat, established Galkot Rajya in 1631 BS.A stone inscription states that Kot Ghar was constructed in 1661 BS. Galkot was free until Jagat Pratap Malla's rule in 1844 BS. The local government has been trying to preserve the historical artefacts to showcase to the visitors. The ancient palace of Galkot was in dire straits because of the lack of conservation.The Shreemeher Gana barracks of the Nepal Army and Galkot municipality have jointly renovated the almost-collapsed Kot Ghar.Professor Din Bahadur Thapa, a historian, said that the state also produced rice during the 10th generation of kings 213 years ago. After that, until 2015 BS, the kings of Galkot remained rulers. After the last king, Bharat Bam Malla, was elected to parliament in the 2015 BS general election, Raja Rajouta stepped down. There is a history of Bharat Bam submitting a proposal to remove Raja Rajauta from the House of Representatives.Thapa's research mentions that the state of Galkot extended to Kathekhola in the east, Pandavakhani in the west, Rum in Myagdi in the north, and Musikot in Gulmi in the south. After the kingdom was taken away, Jagat Pratap Bam Malla moved the palace to Shraddhakhet. The last king, Bharat Bam, built a palace in Harichor Bazar in 1990 BS. The construction started in 1978 BS.Even until 2019 BS, the central administrative units of Baglung were in Galkot. Later, they were shifted to Baglung Bazaar. The Kot Ghar conservation and tourism promotion programme was started five years ago to reflect this legacy. Bir Jung Bhandari, former ward chairman of Galkot Municipality, had started some of the works.Bharat Sharma Gaire, mayor of the municipality, said that the historic city planning and the work to preserve the history had been completed with the help of the Nepal Army.Cannoning infrastructure has also been built at Sahasradhara waterfall near Kot Ghar. Festivals are organised during the Dashain and Chaite Dashain. Hundreds of pilgrims tour these religious sites annually.Locals conduct regular worship. A hundred houses in Kotmaidan village offer worship by taking ownership. It is listed in the city pride project.The weapons in Kot Ghar have been kept separately by making a new home. The doors and windows of Kot Ghar have been modelled on the Bhaktapur craft. On the way to Kot Ghar, a barbed wire fence and railing have been set up.Drainage and culverts have been constructed in some road stretches that reach Kot Ghar from the mid-hill highway. The municipality has been investing yearly to pave the road to Kot Ghar. The location is important from the tourism perspective.Galkot Valley, Ghumte hill, Daram River, and Tara River can be viewed from Kot Ghar. Kalika temple, near Kot Ghar, has also been maintained.Nearly 100 ropanies have been protected through barbed wire fences. The number of tourists visiting Kot Ghar has recently increased with the construction of drinking water taps and resting areas.The association of the former army conducted a district-level annual general meeting in the Kot Ghar area.It is presumed that the state was named Galkot, derived from ‘Golo Kot’, the way the Kot Ghar was built.Kot Ghar, located in Galkot Municipality-3, was the first seat of the kings. Though the king shifted to Harichaur through Shraddakhet, the weapons were kept in Kot Ghar and Kalika temple. Other structures were also built around Kot Ghar. Gaire said the places of historical importance were protected. A six-kilometre road has been built from the mid-hill highway to Kot Ghar.The road to Kot Ghar from the highway was maintained and paved, said Pham Bahadur Khatri, the ward chairman. He said that around Rs1.5 million was spent to renovate Kot Ghar, and the Nepal Army provided Rs900,000 and the human resources. \nThe government last week raised the minimum support price for paddy by more than 6.5 percent for the harvest of the next fiscal year, 2023-24, soon after the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led administration was reduced to a minority.This was the second time the government fixed the minimum support price during the paddy transplantation period. The Ministry of Commerce and Supplies tabled the proposal to increase the price, which was approved by the Cabinet meeting on July 4.The government decided to increase the minimum support price of common paddy to Rs3,580.62 per quintal (Rs35.80 per kg), up 6.50 percent. Similarly, the floor price for ‘mota dhan’ has been increased to Rs3,410.51 per quintal (Rs34.10 per kg), up 6.64 percent.The minimum support price is the lowest legal price that farmers receive for their harvests. The government does not fix the floor price of fine paddy.A minimum support price is an intervention by the government to protect farmers against sudden slumps in market prices. It is the rate at which the government buys farm produce when no other buyers are in the market.Usually, it is announced in time for farmers to make their production plans before the beginning of the planting season. Under the scheme, the government has to buy a certain amount of the total paddy harvest.In 2012, the government announced the resumption of the policy of fixing the minimum price following complaints that middlemen had been determining the market rate.Until 1999, the minimum support price for paddy and wheat would be announced regularly.According to reports, the practice was fully abandoned that year after the government launched the 20-year Agriculture Perspective Plan.Even when the minimum support price was announced, it was irrelevant as it was set well below the projected market price to protect the government from having to buy farm products should prices tumble.Moreover, reports said that even when support prices were announced, it was not done in time.The policy was irregular.In 2016-17, the minimum support price was announced in mid-November. In 2017-2018, the Cabinet sent back the supplies ministry's proposal. In 2021-22, the government announced the minimum support price for paddy on November 3, which is harvest time. The price was raised by 8 percent.On different occasions, members of parliamentary committees have criticised the government policy as ‘absurd’ because it was announced after many farmers had already harvested and sold their crops. Lawmakers said that the minimum support price was supposed to encourage farmers to boost output, but the government-fixed floor price had ‘discouraged’ them instead.It was only since the last fiscal year that the government announced the price before the transplantation season started.Paddy is transplanted in June and harvested by the end of October.This year, as of Sunday, paddy transplantation has been completed on 539,766 hectares as of Sunday, which is 38.6 percent of Nepal's 1.39 million hectares of paddy fields.Tilak Raj Chaulagain, a senior agro economist at the Department of Agriculture, said that the paddy transplantation rate was slightly lower (by 4 percent) compared to the same period last year. This year, the monsoon entered Nepal from the east on June 10, three days ahead of its usual onset date, according to the Meteorological Forecasting Division.Chaulagain said that the monsoon arrived on time, but it took time to be active. “As a result, transplantation was delayed slightly in the hills, but this will not affect production or productivity.\"According to Chaulagain, while transplantation on the hills is nearing completion, it will pick up pace in Tarai from mid-July. The Tarai, the largest paddy-producing region in the country, accounts for 71 percent of the total rice acreage. The hills account for 25 percent, and the mountain region for 4 percent.“Since there are no reports of a shortage of chemical fertilisers this year, we expect transplantation to be completed within a month and a half at this pace,” said Chaulagain.According to the department, Madhesh has the lowest translation rate of all provinces. In Madhesh province, which commands the lion’s share of the paddy fields, transplantation has been completed on 97,851 hectares, which is 25.5 percent of the 383,150 hectares available paddy fields in the province. Nepal’s economic well-being is closely tied to the rainy season. Rainwater is the lifeblood of Nepal's Rs5.70 trillion economy, which relies heavily on agriculture, with nearly two-thirds of the farmlands being rain-fed.During the four months of June to September, a large part of the country receives nearly 80 percent of its annual rainfall.The production of food grain, mainly rice, depends on the amount and distribution of monsoon rainfall over the country. The monsoon rains also replenish groundwater and reservoirs critical for drinking and power generation. \nIn a bid to support midwives and other healthcare personnel in ensuring safer births in low-resource settings, the Ministry of Health and Population has launched a “safe delivery app”.Officials hope that the mobile application will complement and enhance the ongoing capacity-building of health workers and help in reducing maternal and newborn deaths.“The Safe Delivery App provides up-to-date lifesaving procedures and practical guidance in the local language,” said Dr Bibek Kumar Lal, director of the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services, at the launch of the Nepali version of the Safe Delivery App. “It aims to improve the quality of emergency obstetric and newborn care, and the main users will be our frontline health workers, especially nurses and midwives.”Officials at the division said that the government has collaborated with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the Maternity Foundation (MF) to launch the Nepali version of the widely used digital health tool.Globally, every two minutes, a woman dies. In Nepal, two women die every day due to pregnancy-related complications—most of which are preventable, said Won Young Hong, a UNFPA representative in Nepal. “These are staggering numbers. UNFPA is pleased to work with the concerned stakeholders to localise this digital application so healthcare workers across Nepal can use it.”The Safe Delivery App is an evidence-based learning and training tool designed to support midwives, nurses, and other healthcare professionals to assist during births and to manage the most common complications. Among other features, it contains the latest clinical guidelines, animated instruction videos, descriptions of practical procedures, and action cards. It is free, and once downloaded on a smartphone or a tablet, it works offline, making it possible to be used even in the most remote areas. To date, more than 435,000 healthcare professionals across more than 70 countries have been reached through the Safe Delivery App and the accompanying programme worldwide, with Nepal being the latest country to introduce the App. “We will work with provincial governments and development partners to quickly roll out the App throughout Nepal,” said Lal.Nepal cut the maternal mortality rate from 539 per 100,000 births in 1996 to 239 per 100,000 births in 2016—for which the country even received a Millennium Award. According to the National Statistics Office report, the country has further reduced the number of deaths to 151 per 100,000 births in 2021. Maternal health experts, however, say that even if the country has made good progress in reducing maternal deaths, the current maternal mortality ratio is more than double the Sustainable Development Goals target, which is 70 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births by 2030.Neonatal deaths have not declined between 2016 and 2022, according to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022 carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population.The government’s target for the Sustainable Development Goals was to reduce neonatal mortality to 16 deaths per 1,000 live births by 2022 and 12 in every 1,000 live births by 2030.The SDGs, a follow-up on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), aim to end poverty, hunger, and all forms of inequality worldwide by 2030, and Nepal has committed to meeting the goals.The health ministry has been taking several measures to reduce maternal and neonatal deaths, including installing an underfloor heating system at birthing centres, setting up special newborn care units, training doctors, nurses, and paramedics in the district hospitals and distributing non-pneumatic anti-shock garments to prevent maternal deaths from excessive bleeding.Besides, the ministry provides free service and travel allowances for those opting for institutional delivery and antenatal visits. It also distributes misoprostol, a medication used to treat postpartum bleeding in new mothers, through female community health volunteers. \nAs heavy monsoon rains cause chaos across the country, dengue cases are surging in several districts, including Kathmandu.According to the Health Office Kathmandu, around 18 people are infected with the dengue virus every day. Officials, however, admit that this number could be just the tip of the iceberg, as the office gets reports only from 18 health facilities.“Yes, the number of people infected with the dengue virus could be several times higher than suggested by the reports we are getting every day,” said Dr Arjun Sapkota, chief of the Health Office, Kathmandu. “We are working to make daily reporting of dengue cases mandatory for private health facilities as well.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vectors also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus, according to the World Health Organisation.According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,432 people from 73 districts have been infected with the virus since January this year. Among the 73 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases with 159, followed by Jhapa with 120, Chitwan 83, Makawanpur 65, Tanahun and Doti 49 cases each, and Okhaldhunga and Sindhupalchowk 46 each.Sapkota informed that his office has sensitised the local bodies about the looming risk of a massive dengue outbreak in the coming days.“Mandatory reporting of dengue cases every day is among the preventive measures through which we can identify dengue hotspots,” said Sapkota. “This will help health workers target such measures in particular areas. Additionally, starting this week, we are resuming the “10 minutes at 10 am” initiative every Friday, during which mosquito breeding grounds will be destroyed.”Officials informed that several local units, including the Kathmandu Metropolitan City, have already started preventive measures against dengue. Dengue symptoms include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes. Patients with these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and proper medical care can prevent death.Doctors say many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and can be treated with paracetamol at home.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district. Since then, an increasing number of dengue infections, including major outbreaks, have been reported from many districts. Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Though the post-monsoon period is considered the dengue epidemic season, the deadly disease has already become endemic in Nepal, as outbreaks are reported every month, including in the winter months.According to health workers, storage places for scrap materials, discarded cups, plastic material tossed in open spaces, and unused lands will be potential hotspots for the dengue virus in the coming days. Health workers have warned the owners of these sites that action will be taken if mosquito larvae are found there.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects, such as plastic cups and bottles, could be breeding grounds for these mosquitoes. \nWith monsoon havoc sweeping across the country, the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division has urged health workers to avoid taking leave during the season.Officials have warned that health facilities could be overwhelmed by patients in the coming days as outbreaks of waterborne and vector-borne diseases are expected, as floodwaters have contaminated most of the drinking water sources.“We have requested the provincial and local health authorities not to grant leave to health workers during the monsoon season,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director of the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Health agencies have been cautioned about the looming risk of outbreaks of waterborne and vector-borne diseases in the coming days.”Torrential rainfall started Friday wreaking havoc in various places across the country. At least 14 people have died in disaster-related incidents—nine in landslides and five in floods—since Friday, according to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority. Officials said 18 others have been injured, and four people are missing. Since the monsoon entered the country on June 10, at least 43 people have died in landslides and flood-related incidents. Lightning strikes killed as many as 19 people during this period.The monsoon season in Nepal is a time of epidemics during which thousands of people across the country become infected with water-borne and vector-borne diseases.The persistent rainfall that started on Friday not only destroyed houses and inundated settlements but also contaminated drinking water sources.Health officials warned that health facilities could witness an uptick in the number of viral fever cases, and waterborne diseases—diarrhoea, dysentery, food poisoning, and snake bites—in the coming days.“We have also requested central hospitals and medical colleges to be prepared for help during disease outbreaks,” said Ghimire. “As we don’t have enough doctors and health workers to deploy to control the outbreaks, we have to seek help from big hospitals and medical colleges.”Officials at the Ministry of Health and Population said that they have been raising awareness through all available means to inform people of the risks. “Essential medicines have been stockpiled, health workers have been asked to be ready for deployment to affected areas, anti-snake venom has been supplied to health facilities,” said Dr Prakash Budhathoki, spokesperson at the Health Ministry. “As of Sunday evening, no outbreaks have been reported.”According to health experts, sources of drinking water generally become contaminated in disaster-hit areas, and people displaced by natural disasters become highly vulnerable to infections with waterborne and vector-borne diseases. Every year, thousands of people get infected with vector-borne diseases such as dengue, kala-azar, malaria, and scrub typhus during this period. Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts. According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,432 people from 73 districts have been infected with the dengue virus since January this year. Among the 73 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases: 159. Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. Likewise, snakebite incidents and resulting deaths are also common during the season, but the phenomenon, which experts dub “a lurking invisible crisis”, remains grossly neglected. “Incidents of snakebites have started to surge over the last few weeks,” said Dr Rajiv Jha, director at Provincial Health Directorate of Madhesh Province. “Along with the surge in waterborne and vector-borne diseases in the coming days, we have anticipated a rise in snakebite cases.”Doctors say the only ways to prevent deaths from waterborne diseases, including diarrhoea, are to raise awareness and ensure safe drinking water.They say a combination of careful surveys, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation and treatment are required to contain the spread of the diarrhoeal infection. \nWith the onset of the rainy season, the incidents of snakebite are on the rise in western Tarai districts.Snakebite treatment centres and hospitals in Kanchanpur and Kailali districts of Sudurpaschim province are now crowded with snakebite patients. Treatment of the snakebite patients, according to health workers, is quite challenging as patients are often brought to the health facilities at the last minute.As many as 60 snakebite patients visited the Snakebite Treatment Centre set up by Nepal Army at Arjuni of Shuklaphanta National Park within the past three weeks. “Over the past one week three to four snakebite patients have been visiting the centre on a daily basis,” said Ratan Bohora, a paramedic at the Arjuni-based Snakebite Treatment Centre. The local residents have hugely benefited after the Nepali Army and the local community jointly established the snakebite treatment centre at Arjuni in 2014. The centre, however, has to refer the patients with serious health conditions to other well facilitated hospitals due to the lack of an intensive care unit (ICU) and ventilator. “Two patients who were bitten by poisonous snakes were referred to Mahakali Provincial Hospital in Mahendranagar this year. We have no alternative but to send serious cases of snakebite to other hospitals due to the lack of the ICU and ventilator facilities,” said Bohora. The centre also does not even have a monitor to track a patient's vital signs such as blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen levels. The flow of the patients is increasing, but the centre only has two paramedics to provide treatment.Incidents of snakebite and resulting deaths are common in Nepal, but the issue still remains grossly neglected as what experts call a lurking ‘invisible crisis’. Each year, around 2,700 people, mostly children and women from Nepal’s Tarai region, die of snakebites, according to a March 2022 report.Most snakebite incidents occur when farmers are transplanting paddy fields or children are playing outdoors. Health workers say that the snakes that live in water are generally less poisonous. “The cases that are most serious occurred at night, often inside houses. Such patients should be taken to hospital immediately,” said Bohora. According to him, people living in thatched-roof houses are especially vulnerable to snakebite, because snakes often enter such homes in search of rats.Nepal is home to around 17 highly venomous snakes. Each year, the country sees about 20,000 to 40,000 cases of snakebite. The numbers could be higher, as many cases of snakebite go unreported, health workers say.Another health challenge in rural Nepal is the superstitious belief in visiting shamans instead of seeking treatment at medical facilities for snakebite. Experts say awareness drives should be launched to educate people that the snakebite patients should be taken to the hospital at the earliest. They recommend promoting cleanliness around homes, preventing children from playing in bushy areas, avoiding nightime walks, and using torchlight while walking in the dark.“Treatment of snakebite patients is possible if they are taken to health facilities on time. Patients are often brought to the hospital only after their condition has worsened, resulting in serious consequences,” said Dr Arjun Bhatta, medical superintendent at Mahakali Provincial Hospital. According to him, 10 snakebite patients with serious health conditions visited the hospital in the past three weeks. “They returned home after treatment,” said Bhatta. \nParopakar Hospital is organizing a healthy baby competition on August 13 to promote proper baby care, including exclusive breastfeeding, vaccination, and family planning.\nA culinary journey from a first kitchen experiment leading to the development of baking skills, emphasizing precision, technique, and the joys and challenges of home baking, culminates in a recipe for indulgent \"Bliss Brownies.\"\nLGBTQIA+ individuals have historically faced discrimination and judgment, leading to the need for safe spaces like the Stonewall Inn and Inclusive Galaxy, which provide acceptance and support for the community.\nAditya Mishra, a Nepali chef in New York, founded the supper club 'The Sewing Tin' to promote Nepali cuisine, drawing inspiration from his Michelin-starred experiences while balancing traditional flavors with modern culinary styles.\nCeleus Baral, an environmental science student, combines her passion for baking with environmental awareness through her online shop, Bakeleus, showcasing her creativity and advocating for zero-waste practices.\nPotato, a staple food of hundreds of thousands of people, especially those residing in the mountainous regions, is among the most widely consumed and versatile crops in Nepal. The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar. \nThe noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built. Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nEngland finally showed their true colours at the European Championship on Wednesday, putting on a convincing and effective performance when it mattered most to book themselves a berth in Sunday’s final in Berlin.Ollie Watkins’ late winner to secure the 2-1 win over the Netherlands was as much as they deserved after dominating the encounter in a display their supporters had been eagerly awaiting but barely daring to hope for.It was an emphatic answer after the criticism heaped on the side for some languid showings against underwhelming opposition earlier in the tournament, and sets up a mouth-watering final against a slick-looking Spain.England had frustrated their followers, looking pedestrian at times in the group phase as well as their knockout round games. It was as if they were suffocating at times under a heavy burden of expectation, a feeling coach Gareth Southgate said on Tuesday that they learned to leave behind as they went deeper into the tournament.Their round of 16 performance as they edged Slovakia bordered on the miraculous, snatching victory minutes from being eliminated, and there was a nervy showing as they fought back, again, to edge Switzerland on penalties in the quarter-final.This time, however, there was a positivity about their play from the start, even if it was a third successive game where they went behind, this time to Xavi Simons’ spectacular seventh minute effort.Harry Kane’s penalty equaliser was followed by a sustained period of pressure on the Dutch defence, with England shaking off the cobwebs and properly greasing the wheels of their attack.The individual quality of their players was on full display and they had their opponents pegged back, looking dangerous every time they entered the final third. Phil Foden was exceedingly unlucky not to have them ahead at halftime with some sublime skill but had his effort cleared off the line.The second period was not as dominant as fatigue set in and the Dutch enjoyed their fair share of possession.But even then, whenever England moved menacingly forward, a goal looked on the cards.It was almost to script that they engineered victory just before the final whistle, as Watkins emerged an unlikely hero not long after coming on.The confidence boost cannot be underestimated, especially as an in-form opponent awaits on Sunday at the Olympiastadion.When they needed to stand up and be counted, the real England came to the party and, after almost a month of gritty competition, the tournament has two worthy finalists. \nColombia beat Uruguay 1-0 in their Copa America semi-final on Thursday despite being reduced to 10 men for 45 minutes to book a title decider against defending champions Argentina thanks to a first-half header from Jefferson Lerma.Uruguay’s Darwin Nunez missed several chances in the first half and Colombia made them pay when Lerma rose above the defence on a corner in the 39th minute and squeezed his header past goalkeeper Sergio Rochet.Colombia went down to 10 men just before halftime when Daniel Munoz lost his cool and got himself sent off, with the right back receiving a second yellow card for elbowing Manuel Ugarte in the chest when play was stopped.Uruguay dominated possession in the second half and veteran striker Luis Suarez nearly equalised when he hit the post but Colombia bravely held on for a famous win and will play Argentina in Sunday’s final.Uruguay will play Canada a day earlier in the third-place playoff. \nNepal's women's cricket team lost consecutive practice matches against Sri Lanka's Development Squad in preparation for the 2024 ACC Women's T20 Asia Cup.\nDefending champions Argentina advanced to the Copa America final with a 2-0 victory over Canada, courtesy of goals from Julian Alvarez and Lionel Messi, who reached several milestones with his second.\nTeenager Lamine Yamal's record-breaking goal sparked Spain's 2-1 comeback win over France, sending them to the Euro 2024 final against England or Netherlands.\nResidents of Gaza City were trapped in houses and bodies lay uncollected in the streets under an intense new Israeli assault on Thursday, even as Washington pushed for a peace deal at talks in Egypt and Qatar.Hamas militants say a heavy Israeli assault on Gaza City this week could wreck efforts to finally end the war just as negotiations have entered the home stretch.Home to more than a quarter of Gaza’s residents before the war, Gaza City was destroyed during the first weeks of fighting last year, but hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have returned to homes in the ruins. They have now once again been ordered out by the Israeli military.The Gaza health ministry said it had reports of people trapped and others killed inside their houses in the Tel Al Hawa and Sabra districts of Gaza City, and rescuers could not reach them.The Civil Emergency Service said it estimated that at least 30 people had been killed in the Tel Al-Hawa and Rimal areas and it could not recover bodies from the streets there.Despite army instructions on Wednesday to residents of Gaza City that they can use two “safe routes” to head south, many residents refused to heed the order. Some posted a hashtag on social media: “We are not leaving”.“We will die but not leave to the south. We have tolerated starvation and bombs for nine months and we are ready to die as martyrs here,” said Mohammad Ali, 30, reached by text message.Ali, whose family has relocated several times within the city, said they had been running short of food, water and medicine.“The occupation bombs Gaza City as if the war was restarting. We hope there will be a ceasefire soon, but if not then is God’s will.”Withdrawal from ShejaiaJust east of Gaza City in the Shejaia suburb, residents were returning on foot to a desolate moonscape of destroyed buildings after Israeli forces withdrew following a two-week offensive there.The territory’s main cemetery had been bulldozed by the army. People wheeled supplies on the back of bicycles across rubble-strewn tracks, passing the remains of burnt-out and blasted Israeli armoured vehicles.“We have returned to Shejaia after 15 days. You can see the destruction. They spared nothing, even trees, there was a lot of greenery in this area. What is the guilt of stones and trees? And what is my guilt as a civilian?” resident Hatem Tayeh told Reuters in the ruins.“There are bodies of civilian people. What is the guilt of the civilian? Who are you fighting?”Israel launched its assault on the Gaza Strip last year after Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and capturing more than 250 hostages according to Israeli tallies.Since then, Israel’s assault has killed more than 38,000 according to medical authorities in Gaza.At the southern edge of the enclave in Rafah near the border with Egypt, where tanks have been operating in most of the city since May, residents said the army continued to blow up houses in the western and central areas, amid fighting with Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and other smaller factions.Palestinian health officials said four people were killed, including a child, in an Israeli air strike in Tel Al-Sultan in western Rafah.The Israeli military said earlier on Thursday around five rockets fired from the Rafah area were successfully intercepted.The negotiations in Qatar and Egypt follow important concessions last week from Hamas, which agreed that a truce could begin and some hostages released without Israel first agreeing to end the war.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who faces opposition within his right-wing cabinet to any deal that would halt the war until Hamas is vanquished, says a deal must allow Israel to resume fighting until it meets all its objectives.Two Hamas officials contacted by Reuters had no immediate comment on the content of the ongoing talks, led by Egypt, Qatar, and the United States.“There will be a meeting today between Hamas and the mediators to check on what responses they have received from the occupation,” said one Palestinian official close to the mediation, without elaboration. \nUS President Biden welcomed UK Prime Minister Starmer's desire for closer ties with Europe, discussed conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza, and emphasized the importance of unity in addressing global challenges.\nNepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) \nBharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality’s ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via ‘tallo bato’—backdoor route—and that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal. \nGyanumaya BK had been suffering from severe backaches for a while. The resident of Pokhara-15, BK visited the Metrocity Hospital in Srijanachowk seeking treatment five months ago. The 69-year-old, who works as a labourer, has already spent over Rs50,000 on follow-up checkups and medications.BK spent eight days in the hospital in January and has been paying off loans she had taken to pay her bills and for follow-up visits to the hospital. Had BK been aware of the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020, which private hospitals must adhere to, she wouldn’t have had to borrow money to pay her medical bills. As per the regulations, hospitals must set aside 10 percent of their total beds to the underprivileged and needy.“I didn’t know hospitals were required to provide free treatment to those who can’t afford hospital stays,” BK said. “But even if I did, I would have to fight to get the service as the hospital won’t willingly offer me the service.”The Pokhara-based 50-bed hospital’s Chief Executive Officer Gyan Prasad Aryal admits that his hospital does not adhere to the mandate. “We don’t have explicit information from the health ministry on the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020,” said Aryal. “Moving forward, we will follow the instructions.” The hospital authorities say they give a 10-15 percent discount on the final hospital bill as opposed to dedicating 10 percent of their beds and free treatment and medications to the less privileged. Hospitals with 15 beds come under the jurisdiction of the local units while those with up to 50 beds fall under the ambit of the Provincial Health Directorate. Likewise, the Provincial Health Ministry oversees health facilities with over 50 beds.However, no regulatory body has data on whether health facilities are following government rules, especially Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. But it is an open secret that most private hospitals in Pokhara are not following the regulations.Pokhara Municipality Health Department Officer Yadunath Baral, Kaski District Health Officer Bhim Prasad Poudel, and Province Health Director Khim Bahadur Khadka all admit that local hospitals disregard the regulations. “Our monitoring and inspection is also lax, that’s why most hospitals ignore the rules,” he said. He says lack of manpower hampers effective inspection. “Our manpower is enough to conduct inspections in other districts, but not in Kaski, which has many private hospitals,” he said. “We need more people for that”. According to Baral, although the hospitals claim to offer a certain discount on final bills to the needy, they are unable to show the record of the discounts provided. “The hospitals claim they give discounts, but most hospitals have not even been able to show us the proof,” said Khadka. “Legal actions should be taken against the hospitals that fail to submit a monthly report on the free services for the poor. More importantly, they must be liable for flouting government standards that aim to benefit the poor.” The Provincial Health Directorate also does not have any data on the directive’s implementation at hospitals with more than 50 beds.The department’s chief of health services Dr Ramesh KC says that they have been working on updating information of health services in the Gandaki region. “Hospitals have failed to submit their mandatory monthly reports. We will seek that information when they come for new permits or permit renewal,” KC said. There are 27 privately-owned hospitals within the Pokhara Metropolitan City and 39 in the Gandaki region. Bharatpur Metropolitan City in Chitwan in Bagmati Province is also called the ‘medical city’  as it is home to 23 private hospitals with a total of 1,200 beds. Additionally, there are multiple large-scale government hospitals and two medical colleges—Chitwan Medical College and College of Medical Sciences—that also provide medical services. Had the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020 been followed by the 23 private hospitals, 120 patients would have received free health services every year, according to Durgadutta Chapagain, chief of the Chitwan Health Office.“Although the hospitals claim they provide the services, none have been able to provide convincing proof. Instead, we found them giving such discounts to patients who are close to hospital operators,” said Chapagain. “Our department validates the permits for new health facilities and re-registrations for hospitals with a 25-bed capacity. We have asked such public health service providers to put up posters or stickers reading ‘Discounts for the needy’ on the hospital premises so that patients know what services they can get on discount.”Meanwhile, Bikram Adhikari, Secretary of the Private Hospitals Coordination Committee in Chitwan, claims that the regulations are impractical. “There are a few services that hospitals can provide free of cost. You cannot expect hospitals to provide all services for free. That’s why there is a need to amend the existing regulations,” said Adhikari.The monitoring bodies’ inaction and lackadaisical approach to ensuring that public health services are accessible and affordable to all makes private hospitals blatantly ignore government mandates.Bharatpur Metropolitan City’s Deputy Mayor Chitrasen Adhikari says that although the metropolis is aware that private hospitals must allocate 10 percent of their beds for free treatment of poor people, the metropolis administration has yet to devise a monitoring mechanism. “We have not taken any steps towards that end, but we will soon,” he said.Just like Pokhara and Chitwan, Biratnagar is also plagued with the same problem. There are 32 private hospitals currently in operation in the metropolis. Deepak Bhattarai, statistical officer at the municipality’s health office, asserts that none of the health facilities met the set requirements. A monthly report submitted by the Biratnagar-based Nobel Medical College and Teaching Hospital, which has 750 beds, stated that the hospital had provided the said concession to more than 400 patients. “However, the report did not clarify how many of the 400 patients were provided free hospital beds and the services that come along with the beds, and how many were given discounts on their hospital bills,” Bhattarai said. “We found that hospital reports also include concessions provided to patients who sought outpatient, emergency, and X-ray services.”The hospital’s director Narayan Dahal claims to be following all government instructions. He says 10 percent hospital beds are set aside for needy patients who are not charged any treatment fees, while 10 percent of service seekers also get discounts.Although the Biratnagar Metropolis has directed all health facilities under its jurisdiction to allocate free beds and provide free services to the needy, inform service seekers about the government-provided services, and submit a list of all patients who have received the services, the directive is ignored more often than followed. According to Bhattarai, medical establishments must get a letter from the local unit before making any upgrades or purchasing any equipment. “But the hospitals have been found presenting fake documents in order to acquire such permits,” he said. “The metropolis has refused such permits to 12 private hospitals in the current fiscal year.”Butwal Sub-Metropolitan City in the Lumbini Province has also taken no concrete step to ensure private hospitals adhere to Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. Despite having the authority to carry out inspections, the sub-metropolis’ apathy has deprived hundreds of needy patients of various government services. The sub-metropolis with 17 wards has more than two dozen big hospitals in the Butwal bazaar area itself. Not one of them adheres to the government’s health regulations. But the sub-metropolis is yet to monitor these hospitals. Yubraj Pandey, chief of Butwal Sub Metropolitan’s health department, says they have been unable to inspect medical institutes due to a lack of a proper set of rules.“I have just been transferred here. Discussions are underway to prepare legal requirements,” he said. Private hospitals in Butwal only began filing their reports two months ago after a joint meeting, informs Chief of the Sub Metropolitan’s Education and Health Department Mitramani Khanal. Twenty-year-old Suraj BK of Sarawal Rural Municipality-2 in West Nawalparasi got into a motorcycle accident on April 26. He suffered injuries on both his legs and was taken to Zenus Hospital and Research Centre in Butwal. Suraj was handed a bill of Rs 70,000 for treatment but he did not have the money to clear the bill and sought the hospital’s help. “The hospital refused to provide any discount. They in fact refused to discharge me. I got my discharge papers only four days later after I paid almost Rs 100,000,” he said. “I had to get a loan to pay the hospital bills as my father, who is a farmer, did not have that kind of money.”Dr Sharda Singh, the hospital director, said Suraj did not qualify for a discount as he did not have a recommendation letter from the local unit. “Patients have to get a recommendation to avail of free services at private hospitals but Suraj could not bring one,” she said. “I was in the hospital bed for four days. I could not have secured a recommendation from the local unit in that state,” said Suraj. Ishwari Prasad Chapagain, a civil society leader of Rupandehi and a member of the Consumer Interest Protection Forum, says private hospitals in Butwal are more interested in making money than helping those in need. “They do not follow government mandates. They act as if they have to bear the expenses of providing free service to the poor when in fact they get tax rebates and such for such services,” he said. “The sub-metropolis also does not do the needful. Everyone is corrupt including the city officials.”  \nThe one lesson Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal seems to have forgotten even as he indulged in all manners of chicanery and machinations to stay in power was the simplest—two can play the same game. In his case, it was actually three but the end result was the same. For a public long wearied of his constant restlessness and the promise of even more instability, the universal reaction to the Oli-Deuba gang up against Dahal was either studied indifference or a feeling that justice has been served.To now be known as the ‘Duplicitous One’ is a big step down from the ‘Fierce One’, the translation of his nom de guerre most commonly used in the heady days when Dahal had just entered mainstream politics. And rather than admit that he had been beaten at his own game, the prime minister has been on a whine, even singing a song about betrayal in love. Most of all, though, warning yet again that regressive forces were becoming active.No record to whine aboutOne just wonders if Dahal(and his minions) now going to town about how the incoming alliance will take the country backward even pause to consider his own record. From engaging in mindless politicking to donning the daura-suruwal to complete his metamorphosis from revolutionary leader to an ordinary politician, what has he done to advance the cause of progressivism that is substantially different from other governments?Since the issue of ‘inclusion’ is one that the Maoists, somewhat justifiably, can be proprietorial over, let us take the case of the different constitutional commissions aimed specifically at furthering that objective. Under ‘Other Commissions’, the 2015 Constitution has provisioned for the National Women Commission, the National Dalit Commission, and the National Inclusion Commission. Following these three are the Adibasi Janajati Commission, the Madheshi Commission, the Tharu Commission, and the Muslim Commission.Why the latter four were not designated as ‘national’ beats reason as does why Tharus were granted a separate commission since, by law, Tharus are also part of the larger Adibasi Janajati grouping. Equally so, why there was no indication of what these ‘non-national’ commissions were to do. Grafted as they were into the draft of the constitution in the wake of the horrific Tikapur incident of August 2015, the political parties were in such a great hurry to assuage those with serious misgivings with the draft constitution that they simply declared that there shall be such-and-such commissions and left it at that. Granted, the Maoists did not have much bargaining heft back in 2015. But they could at least have called for a more comprehensive copy-and-paste job with regard to these commissions. Not that it would have mattered one whit since, over time, all the commissions, ‘national’ or otherwise, have been given nearly the same reduced responsibilities as well as shrinking authority. And, the Maoists have played along without demur. To top it off, even though Dahal has headed the government for the past year and a half, the resource crunch in these commissions, both human and financial, remained wholly unaddressed. These commissions will all be facing an existential threat next year since a review is a constitutional requirement. With barely anything to show over the years, it should come as no surprise if the commissions were written out of the constitution. But it is more likely that the Maoists and other parties will follow the politically expedient path of letting them toothlessly exist as they are.Three ole menHaving said that, we do wonder what kind of political system we live under. All the goings and comings among and between the three major parties, the Nepali Congress, the UML and the Maoists, can hardly be called that. For it was not engagement among parties but just individuals. It is absolutely amazing that for each party, the president alone can decide the way forward. And the office-bearers elected and nominated are then left scrambling for post-facto justifications of their leader’s actions they mostly had no inkling about.Hence, Sher Bahadur Deuba felt no need to take into confidence the party leadership when he decided to back away from the pre-poll understanding with Dahal on who would first lead the government back in 2022. Neither did KP Sharma Oli feel the need to explain to his cadre why he preferred a, b or c as the presidential candidate over x, y and z. Dahal being the self-styled disruptor and heading a party new to democratic politics, obviously would not deign to take anyone’s advice for anything. He now finds no one but himself to blame for the unsavoury situation he has led his party into. The tragedy is that the entire country is being held hostage to the whims of these three men and is likely to be so well into the future.Country doing fineThese men’s efforts to hold back Nepal notwithstanding, we seem to be doing somewhat fine. As mentioned in an earlier piece, national poverty rates have shrunk despite the political dysfunction of the past decade. By one reckoning of the World Bank, measured against the ‘International Poverty Line’ of a per capita income of USD 2.15 per day, poverty has made an exit from Nepal. We will let the economists quibble over these numbers but the fact remains that in spite of the politics, the country is not doing so badly.I would even argue that our democratic space remains open precisely because of the unstable politics we complain so much about. It cannot be just the role of the national character or other such attributes that Nepal is the most open in the region. Just look at the neighbourhood. Each country is in the grip of either a strongman (India, and, till recently, Sri Lanka), or a strongwoman (Bangladesh), or an undemocratic institution (Afghanistan, Myanmar and Pakistan). Our man Oli did try to pull a stunt a la Erdoğan/Orbán/Modi on us when he headed the most powerful government in Nepal’s modern history. But his ambition was cut short by, at times, the force of civil society opposition and, at others, an alert judiciary. We do not know if Oli has tempered his autocratic instincts since. Coalition politics will certainly keep them at abeyance for now. Until the next election, that is. The real test of his and of other leaders will be if they were to lead their party into an emphatic victory. Will we then follow the path of so many other countries of sliding into some form of electoral autocracy? Or will our civil and political institutions be strong enough to withstand any such attempt to undermine them? I am betting on the latter and hoping against hope that I am right. \nAs Iran’s President-elect, Masoud Pezeshkian, continues to receive congratulatory calls from global leaders, he is due to hold discussions with foreign counterparts from July 8, with a swearing-in before the Parliament not scheduled before the first week of August. This does not seem to prevent senior Iranian diplomats from supporting Pezeshkian’s policies (from engaging the West to Afghan refugees, which was a focal point of discussion during the elections). That said, it remains unclear as to how the conservative political regime will respond to his policies, with one scholar referring to over two interactions with the Ayatollah, speculating Pezeshkian to have received some directions/guidance on the same. On enquiring over Pezeshkian’s interaction with the Ayatollah, one IRGC commander acknowledged Pezeshkian received direction to continue the foreign policy initiatives of his predecessor, the late former president Ebrahim Raisi, without naming the Ayatollah. It may be too early to predict the potential prospect of Pezeshkian’s Middle East policy or future efforts to renew Iran-West diplomacy with a neighbouring Taliban, but we witness some excitement within the Rahbari Shura, with members enthusiastically watching this political transition.Afghan migration post-Taliban ruleAs the third year of Taliban rule comes to a close, Afghans continue to apply—in large numbers—for migration to Iran, a pattern which appears to have grown since 2021. According to a source close to Khalil Haqqani (the acting Minister of Refugees), citizens (by hundreds) continue to stand in line outside the Ministry of Refugee and Repatriation in Kabul, seeking permission to leave the country.With the Islamic Republic of Iran topping the list of countries hosting Afghan refugees since the Taliban rule, Iran’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Ambassador Amir Saeed Iravani, during a Security Council session on June 21, reflected the reality. He stated that Iran has hosted over 6 million Afghan refugees till date. In what appeared to be a call for global support on the fate of Afghan Refugees, he argued that the Afghan refugees cost over $10 billion annually for sanctioned-struck Iran. With economic challenges and sanctions drastically sinking Iran’s economy, this amount may be phenomenal, with thousands of Afghan refugees waiting to flee.Tehran’s approach to Afghan refugeesThe fate of Afghan refugees in Iran and Tehran’s approach to resolving the refugee crisis may appear to be pertinent as questions, but they receive occasional responses from Tehran. The future of millions of Afghans living in despicable conditions throughout Iran raises questions on the sheer absence of housing, medical care, education, reunification of families (living within various camps), citizenship, access to bank accounts, or right to work, among other basic facilities, in the background of sheer ambiguous occasional responses from the Tehranian political class. To the Iranian public, the presence of Afghan migrants living in Tehran is a significant cause of concern, as expressed roughly by every scholar we interviewed. Unlike nations with dedicated migration frameworks/programmes/initiatives formulated by state humanitarian entities, Iran lacks a migration policy. This reflects local Iranians’ sentiment towards Afghan migrants, forcing Tehran to maintain some distance from the issue, creating a policy vacuum. Devoid of social interaction/societal integration, the Afghan migrants continue to be viewed with great suspicion, forcing local authorities to deny them even basic amenities and access to decent living.A hope from Pezeshkian?In many economies, migrant/refugee policies have always found their way through the electoral process. They did so, even in Iran’s conservative political system, with presidential candidates arguing on the issue of migrants. During the presidential race, Mohammad Ghalibaf and Pezeshkian emphasised the need to seriously address the Afghan refugee issue, at least in their campaign, garnering greater interaction/engagement over the problem. However, it remains ignored and occasionally answered by Tehran when asked by South Asian/Western scholars.Reflecting on Pezeshkian’s presidential campaign, we decided to predict that President-elect Pezeshkian's refugee policy—which remains unclear due to the Ayatollah’s constant guidance (according to one scholar)—may vary from closing the eastern borders with Afghanistan and Pakistan to mass deportation of refugees to a dedicated refugee agreement with the Taliban government or creating a dedicated Afghan refugee policy without alienating the Taliban. Those close to Pezeshkian reflected some positive outcomes to the Afghan refugee issue since “the President-elect aims to formulate a multi-dimensional approach to counter illegal foreign nationals”, according to a source who advises him on migrant issues.According to a Tehran-based scholar, Pezeshkian may call for a complete border closure, taking a harsher stand on migration in the first few weeks of his presidency. Although the President-elect discussed the challenges to migration and the influx of refugees (in Europe) with European leaders, it is highly likely for him to request that EU leaders accept some refugees if the Israeli hostage negotiations between the US and Hamas conclude successfully. It would not be incorrect to credit Pezeshkian on his positive reflection towards Afghan refugees, which, according to him, would play a positive/progressive role in Iran’s development, terming their contribution as constructive to the country’s growth.With the elections over and Pezeshkian yet to take office, the issue of Afghan refugees (which took precedence during his election campaign) may take a back seat, at least until August.A dedicated Afghan refugee policy?Without a doubt, the President-elect aims to govern refugees, and he understands the challenges of shutting down the border. Unlike his counterpart, he has drawn lessons from Trump’s Mexico Wall or the stricter stance of right-wing policymakers in Europe. It remains unclear whether his government would formulate a dedicated refugee policy (even one dedicated to Afghan refugees), carrying the risk of alienating either his voters, regime loyalists, Ayatollah himself or the Taliban.Pezeshkian’s first few months of the presidency will focus on the Gaza War, sanctioned hit economy, increasing unemployment and depleting workforce, not on the Afghan refugee crisis. Nonetheless, he could initiate policies and programmes to integrate Afghan refugees into a constructive role in Iran. The argument of a refugee policy/migrant reform dedicated to Afghan refugees appears far-fetched, but the President-elect may allow them to contribute to Iran’s economic development and infrastructural growth and also guarantee better housing, healthcare and access to better living.That said, decisions about the fate of Afghan refugees are made at levels higher than the legislative branch (executive under the guidance of the Supreme Leader), which the President-elect Pezeshkian cannot substantially change even as a policy. Though he may bring minor alterations in such a scenario, a fundamental change is but ideal. \nThe 2015 Constitution marked a significant milestone in Nepal’s political history. Its formal implementation began with the election of the three levels of government—federal, provincial and local—in 2017. As Nepal enters a new phase of its political evolution, it is an opportune moment to consider necessary amendments to the constitution to strengthen federalism and democracy. The Post also published an editorial titled 'Easy does it' this Monday, highlighting the complexities involved in this process. The Nepali Congress and the Communist Party of Nepal (UML), the two major political parties, claim to have agreed to amend the constitution. If so, this is a positive step toward addressing critical governance issues. However, alliances and agreements between these major parties are precarious and prone to change, threatening political stability. There are talks of forming a national consensus government and amending the constitution, but the possibility and impact of such an endeavour remain questionable.Nine years after its promulgation, the constitution’s shortcomings and inconsistencies have become evident. A severe review of the constitution's implementation is necessary, and reforms and amendments must address these issues. The constitution should be seen as a dynamic and living document, not merely a source of problems. This approach emphasises continuous improvement to reflect the evolving political and social environment.A good constitution alone does not ensure good governance; it requires competent, sincere and committed leaders. The constitution issued by the Constituent Assembly is certainly an improvement over previous versions, but its implementation has been slow. Provincial and local governments have struggled to exercise the rights granted by the constitution. For instance, the constitution assigns provinces the exclusive right to exercise police powers, but this has not been allowed in practice.Frequent changes in power have caused dissatisfaction among citizens. While the United States has maintained the same federal constitution and governance system for over two centuries, Switzerland has had the same federal system for 176 years, Canada for 157 years, and India for 74 years. These countries have undergone repeated constitutional reforms to ensure stability. In contrast, Nepal has seen numerous changes in its governance system and constitution.Federalism is the cornerstone of Nepal's constitution. The issue lies not in the constitution itself but in its implementation by the rulers. Instead of addressing constitutional loopholes, leaders have exacerbated them. Reforms in the electoral system are essential to achieving stability and a better federal governance system. Nepal’s mixed electoral system has led to coalition governments. While some people lament that small parties play disproportional roles in the coalition culture, a coalition of diverse parties can also bring more comprehensive ideas and solutions for the country’s development. However, individual interests have often taken precedence over national interests, leading to a lack of collective accountability. Therefore, reform of the electoral system is inevitable.A significant debate revolves around whether to reduce the seats allocated for proportional representation in the House of Representatives. The proportional representation system was designed to ensure fair representation for women, Dalits and marginalised communities. Removing this system altogether, or even reducing its weightage, without addressing the underlying issues of representation, would be inappropriate and counterproductive. The fault lies not in the electoral system but in the political leadership that constantly changes alliances.Some politicians and analysts have proposed direct election of the Prime Minister and Chief Minister, which could lead to more stable governments. This change would require making parliamentary elections entirely proportional, ensuring that MPs focus on law-making and government oversight. They also propose reforming the structure of the provinces, as the current federal system does not appear to function effectively. Reducing the number of Members of Parliament (MPs) is necessary. The House of Representatives (HoR) currently has 275 seats, and the Provincial Assemblies together have 550 seats. The large size of the HoR and the provincial assemblies has resulted in huge expenses. The first-past-the-post (FPTP) voting system should ensure that everyone is directly elected, and the number of MPs should be adjusted accordingly. Reducing the number of MPs elected through the proportional electoral system—currently 110 in the HoR and 220 in the provincial assemblies—will also address the high costs associated with federalism. However, in the FPTP system, those elected via the proportional electoral system, such as women, Dalits and other marginalised communities, should be addressed with reserved constituencies. In such cases, elections should be held exclusively within these groups.The proportional electoral system is not inherently flawed. However, it has often benefited those with political connections or financial influence. To address this, proportional candidates should be elected based on joint votes from political parties and candidates, ensuring the people approve them. Amendments should include fixing the tenure of the Prime Minister, similar to the President and local level heads, who have two tenures. The PM should not serve more than two terms. Limiting MPs from becoming ministers can also reduce political corruption. Reducing the number of ministers is crucial; the current provision for up to 25 ministers is excessive. With the provincial and local levels taking more responsibilities, the number of ministries at the federal level should be reduced by half.Nepal's federal system must also streamline the number of departments and ministries. Many existing departments play insignificant roles and should be abolished or transferred to provinces. Stability at the provincial level is another critical issue. Frequent changes of Chief Ministers have led to public discontent. Direct elections for Chief Ministers can enhance accountability and stability. The constitution should be amended to allow the Vice President to become the Chairperson of the National Assembly. This will reduce additional expenses and enhance the role and effectiveness of the National Assembly.Amending the constitution requires a two-thirds majority in both houses of Parliament, which the Congress and the UML alone cannot achieve. Forming a national consensus government is necessary to garner the required support. However, significant contradictions among the parties on constitutional issues make it challenging to reach a consensus. These contradictions need to be addressed through dialogue and compromise to move forward effectively.The constitution outlines formal roles and duties and expects certain behaviour from political and institutional actors. Political parties, leadership, parliament, judiciary and constitutional bodies must establish actions aligned with the constitution's essence. Without this alignment, politics cannot gain people’s trust, and the Constitution becomes merely a tool for gaining power.Judicial reforms are also crucial for constitutional stability. The constitution must be amended to address these issues comprehensively. Disillusionment and mistrust towards political leadership and politics in general are prevalent. This sentiment stems from the opportunism of political leaders rather than the constitution and the system. We need a new generation of leaders who can feel the changing aspirations of society and maintain relevance in politics. Leadership should focus on long-term national interests rather than short-term personal gains.Nepal stands at a crossroads where constitutional amendments can pave the way for a more stable and prosperous future. The collaboration between major political parties and the lessons from international experiences underscore the importance of these reforms. By addressing the current challenges and ensuring proportional inclusive representation, Nepal can strengthen its federalism and democracy, fulfilling the aspirations of its people.Finally, amending the constitution alone will not solve the problems unless it is accompanied by a change in political culture and leaders’ attitudes and actions. Political stability and effectiveness depend on the commitment of political actors to uphold the principles of the constitution and work towards the common good. This holistic approach is essential for ensuring the constitution remains a robust and guiding document for the nation’s future. \nAs much as we love the monsoon for its greenery and promise of a bountiful harvest, we dread floods, landslides and diseases. As in years past, disasters have wreaked havoc in several parts of Nepal this year too, leading to at least 70 deaths since June. Adding to the woes are vector- and water-borne diseases, such as viral fever, diarrhoea, dysentery, food poisoning, typhoid, dengue and kala-azar, turning the season into a time of epidemics. The Epidemiology and Disease Control Division has already warned doctors and the public of possible uptick in incidents of these diseases.In 2022, as a result of contaminated water, Kathmandu Valley saw an outbreak of cholera, with 77 positive cases reported. The same year, diarrheal diseases affected hundreds of people for many months. Just last month, a patient tested positive for the Vibrio cholerae 01 Ogawa serotype at the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital, of which the authorities were reportedly unaware, as per a Post report. This is not a good sign, as many cases usually go unreported because people don’t visit hospitals unless there’s an emergency, and a lack of investigation from the government means no awareness about the possible spread of cholera. Such negligence about a deadly disease will only fuel its spread.Moreover, the dengue outbreak in the country has gone out of hand over the years. According to official records, the virus has circulated to 73 districts, infecting almost 1,500 people since January. What is concerning is that these numbers could go up, as we aren’t even halfway through this monsoon, and the dengue virus lasts until post-monsoon. Additionally, climate change and rising temperatures have pushed the disease even into the winter season. Recently, health experts have also been worried about the possible instances of the Zika virus (similar to dengue) in Nepal, as cases are being detected in the southern neighbour India. The outbreaks of these diseases and their prolonged presence can easily drain the healthcare facilities of an under-resourced country like ours. In the monsoon crisis, the poor and vulnerable suffer the most, as their condition is compounded by contaminated water, floods, landslides, and other monsoon-related disasters. This not only affects their treatment-seeking behaviour but also their ability to adopt preventive measures, which could in turn lead to community-level transmission of diseases.The Epidemic and Outbreak Surveillance of the Ministry of Health is tasked with collecting data on diseases, informing the general public, and encouraging policymakers to take necessary actions against outbreaks and make people aware of them. Moreover, it also regularly monitors drinking water quality and does surveillance of water-borne diseases. In recent months, it has found harmful substances like faecal coliform in bottled water and even tap water in some places in the Kathmandu Valley. These findings suggest the surveillance and monitoring mechanism in the country has to be strengthened, and local units around the country should be made responsible for keeping their water resources safe throughout the year, especially during the monsoon, to prevent possible outbreaks of water-borne diseases. In the case of vector-borne dengue, Zika and chikungunya viruses, a year-round door-to-door search and destruction of mosquito breeding areas is a must.Nepal has been dealing with monsoon maladies for decades. Our healthcare system should proactively allocate human, infrastructural and budgetary resources to combat these monsoon epidemics and prevent unnecessary loss of life and a whole lot of suffering.  \nThe monsoon has been causing havoc right across Nepal in the past couple of days. At least 70 people have been killed in floods, landslides and other monsoon-related disasters since June 10, according to the Nepal Police. Five others were missing and 86 people were injured in water-induced disasters over a month. There must have been many other incidents not included in official records. The monsoon entered Nepal from its eastern part in the second week of June. Heavy rainfalls that caused huge damage in Bagmati, Gandaki and Lumbini provinces until Sunday, wreaked havoc in far-western Nepal on Monday.As a country with over 83 percent of its land covered by hills and mountains, Nepal is always at the risk of landslides and floods mainly in the monsoon period. Similarly, people in the southern belt are tormented by inundation. Monsoon-related disasters are a yearly occurrence. The Monsoon Preparedness and Response Plan 2024 estimated that over 412,000 households may be affected and of them over 83,000 are likely to be badly hit by monsoon-related disasters this season. In a decade between April 2014 to April 2024, there were 1,602 recorded floods and 2,840 landslides. At least 3,052 people were killed, 791 went missing and 4,176 were injured in the period, according to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority. Similarly, 16,054 buildings and other structures were damaged. This shows the magnitude of the losses caused by monsoon-related disasters in the country.As heavy rains have battered almost all parts of the country, a large number of people have been struggling to deal with the disasters. Besides deaths, missing and injuries, thousands have been displaced and taking shelter in nearby places. In such times, saving lives by rescuing people trapped in difficult situations should be the government’s first priority. Logically, what follows is shifting people from disaster-prone areas to safer places, swiftly distributing reliefs and working on a plan to rehabilitate the displaced. Though our three security agencies often do a commendable job of saving people’s lives, they are still not well-equipped. Just months ago, some of them died while trying to contain wildfires. Rescuers should be equipped with better gears and other logistics before they set out on rescue missions. Moreover, relief distribution and rehabilitation works often court controversy either because of substandard quality of the goods distributed, or the irregularities while carrying out the task.When it comes to rehabilitating flood victims, our state agencies have utterly failed. Thousands of people have been languishing in either nearby forest areas, on riverbanks or other unsafe places for years where they had supposedly been shifted for a few months. For instance, floods in Koshi in August 2008 displaced 7,563 families from the present-day Shreepur, Haripur, and West Kushaha, located across different wards of Koshi Rural Municipality. But they are still living in makeshift huts and mud houses as the government has failed to properly rehabilitate them in the past 16 years. The Koshi Flood Victims Struggle Committee is fighting for their basic rights. A state that cannot ensure the basic safety of its citizens, we are afraid, has gotten its priorities badly wrong.    \nThe text of the midnight deal last Monday whereby the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML agreed to stitch together a new coalition remains hidden, giving rise to much speculation. Yet while talking about the deal, the leaders of the two parties have pointed to the necessity of a ‘national consensus’ government in order to address the country’s pressing problems. This, they say, entails amending the nine-year-old national constitution. Even if the country’s two largest parties come together, they will fall short of a two-thirds majority needed to amend the constitution in the federal lower House. Had they the numbers in the lower chamber, they would have fallen short in the upper House. To amend the constitution, the ruling parties ought to have two-thirds majority in both. This is why many analysts reckon the constitution amendment is no more than an excuse to justify the toppling of the Pushpa Kamal Dahal government. That is unfortunate. The biggest architects of the national charter cannot be so cavalier when it comes to its amendment.The other suspicion is that in pushing for constitution amendment, the two big parties want to significantly reduce the number of proportional representation seats in the two Houses. The reasoning is that the PR seats have allowed many smaller political outfits to enter parliament and to bargain for power with the big parties, thus contributing to political instability. The Congress and the UML also seemingly want to capitalise on the perception that the PR seats are mostly reserved for those close to powerful party chairs rather than for members of the marginalised and under-represented communities, as was envisioned in the constitution. Whatever the case, they should tread carefully. Despite all its flaws, the PR system has significantly increased the political representation of marginalised communities and groups and it would be dangerous to fiddle with it without their buy-in. There is also no guarantee a fully FPTP system will ensure stability. Even before the new constitution came into effect in 2015, not a single government, each one of them formed through direct elections, came close to serving out its full term. This again points to the need for broad consultations—and not a little introspection on the part of our top leaders. A living document that is the constitution can and should be amended on a timely basis, or it becomes irrelevant. But hastily tweaking it could invite more problems than it would solve. It is interesting that many of the high-ranking Congress and UML leaders were unaware of the Monday deal even an hour before it was signed. It is thus hard to believe that the points of agreement were much discussed even inside the two parties, much less in the broader society. For far too long, the leaders of the big parties have treated the apparatus of government pretty much as their personal property. The biggest reason the new federal republican system has not functioned as intended is their sense of entitlement, lack of accountability, and paucity of faith in the system they have themselves championed in public. Unless there is a change in this mindset, no system of governance or election will yield the desired results.  \nThe Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML last week reached an agreement to form a coalition government under the leadership of UML chair KP Sharma Oli. As a part of the package, they also aim to make certain changes to the constitution. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asked Pradeep Gyawali, deputy general secretary of UML, the reasons behind the coming together of the two largest parties, how they plan to run the government and to review and amend the constitution.Many are seeing the Congress-UML alliance as something unusual. What factors brought the two largest parties together even as there is no crisis-like situation or a special task such as constitution writing?Definitely, in normal parliamentary practice, the two largest parties don’t forge an alliance to run a government. The party that gets the biggest mandate leads the government, and the other big party remains in the opposition to make the ruling force accountable. In Nepal, the country’s two major forces, the Congress and the UML, have also joined hands in certain junctures for certain purposes. They worked together to make the constitution in 1990, to conduct general elections in 1999, to complete transition after the 2006 people’s movement and to bring out the constitution in 2015. We felt a need for a similar collaboration this time around. After the November 2022 elections, we saw three alliances in our parliament. At first, Maoist Centre chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal became prime minister with our support, but he failed to abide by the agreement sincerely. He changed the coalition within a month. The subsequent alliance between the Congress and the Maoist Centre lasted for a year. He again sought the UML’s support. Within four months of the March 4 deal with the UML, he started yet another gameplan to join hands with the Congress under the pretext of forming a national consensus government. It was quite unusual for the prime minister himself to instigate instability in the government. He publicly boasted that he had a ‘magical number’ [32 seats in the House of Representatives]. He thought that he could employ the tactic of ‘use and throw’ with the two largest parties and rule the country for the full term. He was completely indifferent to people’s plight, the country’s pressing issues and service delivery. This was the height of irresponsibility. So, the UML and Congress leaders concluded that the time had come to intervene to ensure political stability and service delivery and make sure public frustration doesn’t get out of hand. Did external factors play a role? Recent statements by UML leaders suggest that the party has taken it seriously. When national forces are weak, the neighbouring countries and international forces become more cautious, even more so given Nepal’s geo-political situation. Some of their concerns are valid. They fear political instability in Nepal may have an adverse impact on their genuine issues. We have to take this naturally. Second, it is no secret that we have a long legacy of facing external interference. Sometimes such interventions are carried out covertly and sometimes overtly. Therefore, national forces should be strong. Some political parties and leaders have a tendency of seeking external forces’ support to fulfil their vested interests. In return, they serve the external forces’ undue interests. Formation of a government is a purely domestic affair, but in our case sometimes it also becomes an issue of geopolitical interest. It is said that the UML was spooked when it learned that Prime Minister Dahal had reportedly approached the Congress for a new alliance. This reportedly happened after Dahal returned from New Delhi following Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s swearing-in.We were taken by surprise when the Congress leaders told us that the prime minister had reached out to them with a proposal to form a national consensus government. We were informed about the development from the leaders of the main opposition party. When we reached the March 4 deal with the prime minister, we thought he came to us with a commitment to course correction. Based on that, we supported him almost unconditionally. We didn’t bargain while sharing ministerial portfolios and didn’t talk about the prime minister’s term. We had even thought of allowing Dahal to run the government for the full term if the government functioned well and people were satisfied. We hadn’t even imagined that we would have to think about changing the coalition within four months.We definitely had certain grievances such as a lack of consultation with our party and our lawmakers while preparing the government’s policies and programmes and while allocating budget. Our party chair brought up this issue with the prime minister. But our concerns weren’t addressed. They had already started to ignore us. There were several issues with the prime minister, but we were committed to the partnership. But they had already gone too far. Fortunately, the Congress leaders didn’t accept the offer and instead raised critical questions about the rationale behind the proposal. Basically, the Congress didn’t trust Prachanda ji [Dahal] and came to us. It concluded that Dahal didn’t come with the intent of solving the country’s problems but to manoeuvre between the Congress and the UML.Besides jointly running the government, constitution amendment is another major aspect of the latest Congress-UML deal. What are the provisions the parties want to change?There are four major objectives of this agreement. Safeguarding national interest; strengthening economy; improving governance and service delivery; and ensuring political stability. A debate has started that some constitutional provisions are not helping maintain political stability. What we have said is that it’s been almost a decade since the promulgation of this constitution. Some of its provisions are yet to be implemented. On the other hand, provincial governments complain that they have not been able to work in a full-fledged way because the federal government has still not made some laws they need. So, first, we will undertake a comprehensive review on the progress in the course of implementing the constitution and the challenges we faced in the past decade, among other things. While doing so, we will find out if there are provisions that have posed challenges in maintaining political stability and running a stable government and suggest amendments accordingly.So, it’s not only about the amendment but also about review, assessment and recommendation for amendment, if there is a need. Even if the amendment process begins, it will be limited to ensuring political stability and won’t touch other aspects of the statute. There is no need to over-react. For instance, some Maoist leaders are trying to make it a political issue by describing it as a regressive move. That is wrong.So as per the two-party deal, the statute will be reviewed but not necessarily amended?Yes, whether to go for amendments will depend on the findings of the review. No constitution in the world is perfect. Its success largely depends on the practitioners. So, first we have to differentiate between the role of the constitution and the practitioners. It is true that our society is divided over certain provisions of our constitution. All these issues will be considered, but the fundamental features of the constitution such as democracy, inclusion and federalism won’t be altered. Our priority would be to only remove hindrances in making the system more functional, people-oriented and productive.Of late, people are debating the electoral system, provincial structure and secularism. Will these issues also be dealt with?Federalism is a new system for us. In fact, it is still an in-the-making process in Nepal. We have to note some timelines while analysing the performance of provinces. After the provincial and federal elections in 2017, the first provincial governments were formed in 2018, and they worked for around three years in a stable way. With small cabinets, they worked genuinely to strengthen the provincial system. At the time, most provincial cabinets had around six to seven ministers. They weren’t severely criticised at the time. The wrong trends in the provinces started with the division of the then Nepal Communist Party and the fall of the NCP-led governments at the centre as well as provinces. We saw the trend of horse-trading in provinces. Small parties made unjustified bargaining for ministerial portfolios, chief ministers started splitting ministries and increasing the number of ministers in their cabinets. Also, the November 2022 polls again gave a fragmented verdict, further augmenting the instability and anomalies at the provincial level. So, the problem is the way we are handling things more than the provincial structures. The time isn’t ripe to seek an alternative to the provinces. As far as the electoral model is concerned, we included proportional electoral (PR) system after long debates and discussions. Based on three general elections held after 1990, a conclusion was drawn that the first-past-the-post (FPTP) model couldn’t properly represent the historically under-represented sections. The premise is still valid. Based on the achievements, we may exclude certain communities from the list. But that time hasn’t come. Two questions raised over the use of PR are valid. Is the system really doing justice to the strata and class of the society for which it was introduced? This is the question not about the PR system but the leaders who use it. Similarly, some questions: Is proportional representation required in executive as well because representation is basically vital for policy making? The forms and modalities of the PR system might be discussed, but no one has even thought of removing the inclusive system.Similar is the case with secularism. The spirit is to make the state patron of all religions in the country. However, some sections of society have often tried to misuse and misinterpret the new constitutional provision. They try to interpret secularism as openly allowing rampant religious conversion, and some have made it an excuse to attack the age-old Sanatan faith. For instance, if the President or prime minister visits Lumbini, gurudwara or a shrine of any other faith on certain occasions, that is taken positively, but when they visit Pashupatinath Temple, a section of people raise questions. These activities have made some people think that these attacks on our Sanatan faith are taking place because of the secular system. There is no problem in the constitutional provision because the statute added an explanatory note that states, “‘secular’ means religious, cultural freedoms, including protection of religion and culture handed down from time immemorial.” But some extremist activities have given wrong impressions.Some experts believe the problem of fragmented mandate can be addressed by increasing the threshold required for a political party to be eligible to get PR seats, which can be done by amending laws. Will the Congress-UML alliance opt for this?Yes, this is one feasible option. I am in favour of this. As per the existing provision, a political party can secure seats under the PR category by securing 3 percent votes in the federal parliament and 1.5 percent votes in provincial assemblies. If a political organisation doesn’t even represent 5 or 7 or 10 percent of the population, what can they contribute to the country? You do politics to represent a sizable population and get a public mandate. Otherwise, the presence of such groups would only promote unreasonable bargaining and instigate instability in governments. This can be one of the agenda of the discussion between the two parties.This time, leaders have made it transparent that chiefs of the two parties will lead the government on a rotational basis. But why have other details of the agreement not been made public?There hasn’t been topic-wise discussions on specific provisions. The broader understanding is to review and assess the implementation aspect of the constitution and move ahead based on the findings of the assessment. We have also made it clear that such an act will be guided only by the objective of ensuring political stability and we will not go beyond that. Who will undertake this type of constitution review?We haven’t worked on it in detail. We haven’t reached any understanding. Naturally, inputs will be taken from the constitution makers, experts on constitutional law and politicians involved in this field. But no decision has been made on its nitty-gritty.The Rastriya Prajatantra Party that wants to revive the Hindu kingdom was the first party to welcome the Congress-UML deal while the Maoist Centre has accused Congress and UML of making a regressive move. So don’t you think this affair is tricky?I don’t think the political parties will touch the issues that the RPP talks about, such as reinstatement of Hindu kingdom and dissolution of federalism. No one is thinking about that. Also, the questions raised by the Maoist leaders have no meaning. They are only trying to make a political agenda.It also seems that the Congress and the UML floated this idea of reviewing the constitution to make a case for the two largest parties to form the government.That’s not true. This question undermines the spirit of this agreement. If this system fails, people will raise questions mainly to the leaders of the Congress and the UML, not Prachanda. It’s not only about running the government. We were already in the government and it isn’t a big deal for the Congress to return to power. If democracy fails, the democratic forces will lose the most. So we are genuinely working on this. The Congress and the UML are historical rival forces in Nepali politics. How can the two work together in government?It is true that the Congress and the UML are the two major competitors of this country. But we have some converging factors. First, we both believe in a broader democratic framework. Sometimes, the Congress may give more emphasis on liberal values while we may push for more socialism-oriented programmes. But the common ground is democratic values. We also have the experience of successfully carrying out certain tasks jointly. We may have some friction but we also have experience of managing bitter intra-party fighting as well as inter-party rivalry.How will the ministerial portfolios be shared in the new coalition?We haven’t reached any agreement in detail. As we aim to make this a ‘national consensus government’ we are in favour of accommodating other parties. So it will depend on the number of parties that join the Cabinet. Our only concern is that ministerial allocations should be done in a way that doesn’t weaken the prime minister in order to ensure that the head of the government can deliver.How can a government without the Maoist Centre and some other parties be called a consensus government?We have to wait for that. Leaders of political parties that fiercely criticise the government also join the Cabinet under one or other pretext. Some political parties seemingly cannot exist without being in the government.  \nIn the Secondary Education Examinations (SEE) conducted this year, over 52 percent of students failed to graduate to grade 11. The National Examination Board had enforced the ‘non-graded’ category from this year. The underperformance of the majority of school students has stirred a fresh debate about the test system. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with former National Planning Commission member Usha Jha, who led the committee that recommended the government to adopt the letter grading system.How do you analyse the SEE results published on Thursday?People have reacted to it with shock, not me. In fact, on the basis of the teaching system that is being practised in our schools, I think the results are good. We get the results based on what and how we teach students. Over 52 percent of students have been categorised as non-graded. We need to identify and address the causes behind the bad results. I have heard some people blame the letter grading system. This is wrong. A form of letter grading system was already there. We only suggested an upgraded form of the system. If we start blaming the system, we won’t find the real cause of the problem. What may be the real causes that you are hinting at?The first is the poor quality of teachers in our country. A form of letter grading system was there even before. But it had two loopholes. First, the government took an approach whereby all students would pass. That gave an impression to the students that they don’t need to study hard. That degraded the quality of their education. Second, there was a system of giving marks based on the students’ performances in theoretical and practical exams. Of the total 100 marks, the practical exams made up 35 marks. Most students were given maximum marks in the practical exams. That helped them get higher grades even if they didn’t do well in theoretical exams. This system encouraged students to neglect theoretical studies. That has caused huge damage to our education system. The letter grade system introduced this year has closed those loopholes. But the letter grading system requires a learning environment. The system was introduced without adequate preparation for its effective implementation. Also, the Covid pandemic disturbed preparatory works at the time. We should have drastically improved classroom teaching practices, and trained teachers across the country because their teaching methods are outdated. They weren’t trained on the grading system. They give lectures and encourage students to memorise while the letter grading system requires a thorough process and encourages result-oriented learning. It doesn’t prioritise marks. Our teachers and schools lacked the capacity to implement the new system. Teachers weren’t trained and prepared. Even now, most teachers don’t know what the letter grading system is. The system is necessary to make our students compete in global markets.While we upgraded the system, we didn’t upgrade the schools and teachers. Our teachers engage only in routine and formal responsibilities such as completing textbook courses before the examinations. This system should be properly internalised not only by teachers and students but also school management, palikas [local units] and parents of the students. Only then can it be effectively implemented. These are the major reasons behind the poor results. How is the students’ performance evaluated in the letter grading system?First, teachers should study a lot. They take reference of the subject matter from the textbook and teach students giving a broader perspective of the matter. They have to engage the students practically on the issue. The students should be regularly evaluated based on their participation and response in study and activities. The teachers should teach them and constantly monitor whether they are learning and making progress. The marking should be based on that. So, in this system, the examination starts from day 1 and everyday activities contribute to their marks. It also takes other activities such as behaviour, understanding, presentation into consideration. Therefore, it is called a regular assessment system based on a thorough process, unlike the traditional three-hour-long yearly examination method. If the teachers aren’t competent to carry out these activities, this idea can’t yield good results. They badly need capacity enhancement. The pedagogy should be remodelled.What was the rationale behind the decision to implement this system?One reason was to upgrade our education’s standard on par with the international standards and make our students fit for global markets. In the course of formulating this policy, we undertook a comprehensive research of international practices. Based on that evidence-based research, we submitted a report to then education minister Giriraj Mani Pokharel. The government studied and endorsed it. Basically, this system was introduced with an objective of upgrading our education system in the changed context. But we lacked preparations to implement this idea.We will make a mistake if we change this system. I heard that the education minister [Sumana Shrestha] decided to make some changes in the policy and allow all non-graded students to sit for chance examinations, whereas the system says only those students who secured non-grades in two subjects can retake exams for the same subjects. There is no point in changing the method to favour even the students who have failed in all the subjects. She should have made it clear what factors made her change the criteria overnight. I cannot understand why the minister made the decision in a haste without considering its impact.In fact, our next step should have been capacity enhancement of teachers. The minister took some right decisions such as separating teachers from political parties. But an incumbent minister changing a system that was implemented by a previous minister would cause a problem. She could have formed a panel to conduct a study to find if the letter grading system is the main cause behind the students’ underperformance. But changing a policy through an order didn’t look good.Results show our students are very poor in mathematics, science and English. What could be the reasons?This is unfortunate. We saw similar trends in previous years as well. Mathematics and science are becoming more challenging. One reason is the lack of sufficient teachers for these subjects. Also, some teachers are under-utilised. Some teachers don’t go to the schools. So special measures need to be taken to manage teachers mainly for these subjects. Otherwise, we will have similar results in the coming years.The committee under your leadership recommended that those getting a GPA below 1.6 have to choose technical courses and those willing to study Grade 11 must score above 1.6 GPA. What was the idea behind that recommendation?The idea was to end the situation of halting students’ study and activities because of their lower grades. We have a government body in the form of the Council for Technical Education and Vocational Training (CTEVT) which has been offering dozens of vocational training based on the needs and interests of people. So our youths can join a suitable CTEVT course. We need more people in vocational fields. Skilled people aren’t available in the country. A large number of people working in technical fields in Nepal are from India. We included the provision in consultation with CTEVT officials. Minister Giriraj Mani Pokharel had also prepared a broad plan to implement the letter grading system and integrate the vocational part in our education system. The present government should improve the education system by enhancing teachers’ capacity and encouraging youths to join vocational training to fill the gaps in the employment market. Are the infrastructure and resources available in our education system sufficient to implement the grading system?Some schools lack even essential resources while in some we find misuse or underuse of resources. So, our education ministry should carry out a comprehensive mapping and find where teachers are required, where they are underutilised and where they are idle. Then, the government can make optimum use of the teachers and make additional investment on need-basis. Such an approach will yield better results. In general, our academic institutions lack resources as there is a trend of allocating insufficient budgets for the education sector. Yes, the letter grading system needs more investment. We have to work on teachers’ capacity enhancement and to provide learning materials to students. When you make an activity participatory, you certainly need resources and investments.Do we need to review our teacher recruitment process and our pedagogy in the universities that produce teachers?The government can consider new requirements while recruiting teachers and train them accordingly. Also, we need to update our curriculum and pedagogy for courses such as BEd and MEd to produce quality teachers. I have doubts about the quality of our graduates, post-graduates and even PhD holders due to the poor teaching and learning environment of our academic institutions. There is a need for more coordination and collaboration between the government and universities to address such issues.In the end, I want to stress that the government should adopt a clear and consistent policy and avoid ad-hoc decisions. The letter grading system is the best and we should push for that despite the challenges in its implementation. Just that it should have been enforced after enhancing teachers’ capacity. The problems we have now are due to lack of preparation. \nThe government’s recent decision to recall ambassadors, particularly Nepal’s envoy to India, just ahead of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s visit to New Delhi, courted widespread controversy. What are the takeaways of the prime minister’s Delhi visit? What is the progress in implementing the trade and transit agreement signed with China and with the BRI projects? Thira Lal Bhusal of the Post sat down with Rupak Sapkota, foreign affairs advisor to the prime minister, for some insights.The government’s decision to recall ambassadors from 11 countries at once has come under heavy criticism. Why did the government take such a decision?In general, it has become a practice of sorts to recall incumbent ambassadors and appoint new ones after changes in the government or in the ruling coalition. This has both merits and demerits. The country’s foreign policy doesn’t change with a change in government. But every government and coalition has its specific policies, programmes and priorities. Therefore, even other countries make changes in political appointments as per the government’s priorities. Our case is a bit different. Ruling coalitions are frequently changed, and so are ambassadors. As there is a high chance of our politics being governed by coalitions given our electoral system, it has become necessary to establish a rational system on ambassadorial appointment. Either the political appointees themselves should voluntarily quit the job and return home just like vice-chair and members of the National Planning Commission do. Or there should be a consensus among major political forces to allow our ambassadors to serve out the full term.The second option of allowing ambassadors to serve out their term sounds better, doesn’t it?Definitely. Some initiatives have been taken with the objective of making our diplomatic appointments more prestigious, merit-based and better-managed. The government in 2019 introduced some criteria on ambassadorial appointments. We have to put more effort into ensuring that our ambassadorial appointees have the capacity to effectively carry out diplomatic duties. Once we establish a system of appointing envoys based on merit and not out of political biases, we can create a situation of allowing them to serve for the full term. Then, a change of coalition wouldn’t affect their continuity. We need to develop such a political consensus, given our geopolitical sensitivity.But the ambassadors appointed in recent years and their activities in host countries have lowered the bar of our diplomacy.We have seen rapid and huge changes in power equations in the world. In view of that, we can see some countries have appointed former ministers and even prime ministers as envoys to the countries with whom they have vital relations. They also appoint such personalities as envoys for a special mission. So, we have to think about ambassadorial appointments from different perspectives based on the changed context. It is high time that all the political forces and leaders agree on a basic point that those who have in-depth understanding and expertise of the field and can work for the best interest of the country will be appointed the country’s ambassadors. If the individual is competent, the person’s affiliation to a political party may not be a problem. But whether the person can work in the best interest of the country must be considered before appointment.But the government itself doesn’t seem serious about maintaining diplomatic decorum. For instance, the June 6 Cabinet meeting decided to recall the ambassador from India just days ahead of the prime minister’s New Delhi visit. There were also reports that the prime minister made the decision reluctantly due to pressure from coalition partners. What is the real story?It is nothing more than a coincidence. There were discussions about making changes in the ambassadorial positions in line with the March 4 changes in the ruling coalition. But it was deferred as the government needed to accomplish some important tasks and convene events such as the investment summit. When the government decided to change our ambassadors, it just happened to coincide with the prime minister’s visit to New Delhi to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It was a coincidence. Despite the decision, the ambassador had sufficient time to properly conclude all his engagements and duties there. The way he facilitated the process during the prime minister’s visit doesn’t reflect any misgivings about the government’s decision. So, it should be taken as a course that is in keeping with our tradition. In recent decades, other countries have given top priority to economic diplomacy, but the selection of our envoys and their activities doesn’t reflect that. Why aren’t we thinking in that direction?Yes, diplomacy in the past used to be one-dimensional, or it was conducted mainly by one particular ministry—the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. These days, many other ministries are engaged with international agencies. Economic diplomacy, labour diplomacy, climate diplomacy and security affairs have become crucial. We have to increase coordination, cooperation and collaboration among relevant agencies to make our international relations more fruitful and in line with the policies and goals set by our government.We have seen profound changes in terms of approaches, perspectives and dynamics of diplomacy in recent decades. All countries have started to give more importance to the competence of diplomats also in view of the increased geopolitical competition and rivalry seen between world powers. Rapid innovation in science and technology has not only eased our lives but also added challenges. We have to handle so many diplomatic engagements. Similarly, the number of international forums where we have to engage are increasing. These days, multilateral diplomacy and engagements have become as important. Even minilateral forums have started to play vital roles in international relations as the world powers have adopted multiple strategies to create their spheres of influence. In the meantime, the role of public diplomacy has become influential. So, a diplomat today must be dynamic and efficient enough to grasp the international situation, understand the sensitivity of the host country, articulate our country’s views efficiently and work in national interest. Therefore, it has become vital to be extra careful while selecting ambassadors.You talked about better coordination but we don’t see any correction in the practice of bypassing the foreign ministry while working with international agencies.Definitely, the foreign ministry is our focal point for all international relations conducted by a ministry or agency of our country. There should be no dispute about that. We need to make the foreign ministry more resourceful. Then, the ministry will have more capacity and efficiency to handle issues related to security, finance, labour and climate.Why have we failed to maintain reciprocity in terms of diplomats’ relations with the leaders of host countries? For example, our ambassadors in some capitals don’t get to meet the host leaders for years while the foreign envoys in Kathmandu can meet our prime minister and foreign minister directly and instantly.We have to see it from two perspectives. One is the power structure. In international relations, we can see the reflection of the asymmetric power relations between the big powers and other countries. The more developed and resourceful country’s influence in a host country can be seen and felt. Second, despite being an envoy from an underdeveloped or a small country, one can have diplomatic relations based on the principle of sovereign equality. It depends on the individual diplomat as well.In Kathmandu, we often err when dealing with foreign envoys. We have to decide what level of importance to give them. Therefore, some initiatives have been taken to correct and maintain consistency by implementing a diplomatic code of conduct that aims to integrate all activities through the foreign ministry. Foreign envoys will follow the system if we implement it consistently, irrespective of changes in the government. For that, there should be a political understanding at the national level.Let’s move to Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s recent India visit. Though it was mainly to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Indian Prime Minister Modi, he held some important political meetings. What are the takeaways from the visit?The visit was important from bilateral, regional and international perspectives. Traditionally, foreign affairs was described as an extended form of domestic affairs. But these days, international affairs have influence over domestic affairs as well. So such meetings and dialogues at the prime minister’s level are important. They exchanged views in a very cordial atmosphere. Of late, we have maintained bilateral dialogues at the political level on a regular basis and that has helped remove misunderstandings. Our prime minister’s emphasis is to hold bilateral dialogues both at the political as well as diplomatic levels in order to settle differences. India has taken this spirit positively.Second, the two prime ministers discussed how to expedite the implementation of the agreements reached between Nepal and India during Prime Minister Dahal’s official visit a year ago. The issue was discussed during the meeting between Prime Minister Dahal and Indian External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar as well. They also expressed satisfaction over progress in the implementation of bilateral agreements mainly in energy trade, connectivity and investment. In recent years, we have seen progress in investment, economic and trade sectors. Yet we still have some differences on border issues. That is an important and positive development in Nepal-India relations in recent years. In the past, when we had some differences on political, border or other issues, that used to badly affect other aspects of our relations. But now, both the countries agree to resolve outstanding issues through dialogue and our trade and all other affairs are moving ahead smoothly. This is the encouraging part of our relations. But border disputes can sour our relations anytime, right? Is there a sense of urgency to resolve it once and for all?The prime minister is for activating the concerned bilateral mechanisms to resolve such issues. He has also invited Indian Prime Minister Modi to visit Nepal. We can expect the Indian prime minister’s Nepal visit in near future. We can make some progress in resolving some outstanding matters such as border issues during the high level visit. I believe we will move ahead in this direction.Any progress on submitting the report of the Eminent Persons’ Group?During the meetings, the prime minister raised overall bilateral issues that include the matter related to the EPG report. I think once the mechanisms are activated and start working, that will create a situation for the report’s submission.Nepal and Bangladesh are completing homework for greater energy trade. India’s facilitation is a must for that. Is there any progress on securing the southern neighbour’s support for that?Progress in energy cooperation is a major achievement of this tenure of the prime minister. The progress is not limited to the bilateral level but goes to the regional level. A Cabinet committee of the Bangladesh government earlier this month approved a proposal to import 40 megawatts of electricity from Nepal. At present, we will use India’s infrastructure to export energy to Bangladesh. But for the long term there is a plan to build a dedicated transmission line for that. This shows it is not only Nepal that is interested in exporting its energy but other countries in this region are also interested in importing Nepal’s electricity. We have also signed an agreement to build a cross border transmission line with China. The doors are being opened for regional trade of our energy. This development will make India more open to importing energy from Nepal.Why are we failing to expedite projects under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) of China?The economic cooperation between Nepal and China has substantially increased after we joined the BRI framework. So, Nepal has been benefitting from the BRI. We see some concern about the lack of progress on certain infrastructure projects to be built under the BRI framework. In fact, we are in a better position to implement the projects because now we can decide what kind of BRI projects are good for us based on the experience of project development and implementation under the BRI in other countries.We are working to finalise the BRI implementation agreement. Nepal wants to move ahead by signing the implementation agreement and developing the projects. Nepal joined the BRI framework based on its need to diversify trade and connect to the world market. The reality is the same now. So, we need to sign the implementation plan and move ahead as soon as possible. When I attended the Boao Forum a few months ago, I found the Chinese authorities and other stakeholders holding debates to build quality and resilient infrastructure. They also have plans to support the capacity enhancement of human resources and transfer technology in the BRI member countries.People mainly link the BRI with big infrastructure projects such as railway, road and transmission connectivity but there is no significant progress on these fronts. What are the roadblocks?In Nepal, no big infrastructure project has been completed on time, be it the Melamchi drinking project, airports, hydropower or road projects. We haven’t developed the capacity to build big projects, and we don’t envision any plan to operate after building it. So, not only with China but also with other countries and agencies, we have to seek support for small and medium-size projects that we can efficiently build and operate. Also, the third version of the BRI action plan has included building not only big but small and smart projects under the framework. We have to push for that. As we build our capacity, we can gradually take up big projects. For instance, now we can build big hydro projects on our own. It wasn’t the case until some years ago. We developed expertise in hydropower by building many small projects in the past few decades and gradually enhanced our capacity. We have already faced problems in operating the Pokhara and Bhairahawa airports. Is there any progress in taking Chinese support to operate the airports?We have to see both aspects—domestic as well as international use—of the airports. The two airports have helped us upgrade the quality of our domestic air travel as the passengers have benefited due to the upgraded infrastructure. The number of domestic passengers in these airports has increased significantly.It is true that there is no progress in terms of operating them as international airports. The government is studying all possibilities of their use based on their unique features. We are exploring various options in international markets to attract adventure tourists to Pokhara. Chinese stakeholders are also holding some promotional activities in Pokhara. Chinese authorities have told us that they are consulting with their provincial bodies and exploring possibilities to run regular flights to Pokhara. Similarly, the government is mobilising our embassies and other stakeholders in certain countries having a large number of Buddhist tourists to operate flights to Bhairahawa, and we have received some positive responses. I believe we will be able to operate regular international flights from these two airports soon.It’s been eight years since we signed the trade and transit agreement with China, which was touted as a historic deal between the two countries. Why haven’t we been able to implement it?Some symbolic steps have been taken in this period. For instance, a shipment was received from a third country [Vietnam] using a Chinese port in September last year. Similar other initiatives have been taken but these are limited to symbolic gestures. We have to prepare infrastructure and some legal basis to implement the agreements in a more result-oriented way. A bilateral meeting is being held this week. The meeting is likely to discuss how to bring the trade and transit protocol in an effective way. This meeting will discuss various issues faced so far and will also pave the way forward. We have also proposed to form a ministerial-level mechanism to oversee overall bilateral issues. The upcoming meeting will sort out various issues.The Chinese side was conducting a feasibility study of the Keirung-Kathmandu cross-border railway project. What is the progress?There is progress in various projects that we are carrying out with Chinese support. The cross-border railway feasibility study is in the final stage. Likewise, the study on the Chhahare-Tokha tunnel project is ongoing. A Chinese team is arriving to conduct a feasibility study of the Hilsa-Simkot road. A process to award a contract to build a friendly bridge at Hilsa with Chinese grants has begun. A foundation stone will be laid there soon. Also, a study to build the Chilime-Rashuwagadhi-Keirung 220kV cross-border transmission line is beginning soon. \nThe government has decided to make the National ID Card mandatory in order to receive services from government and public institutions. In the first phase, the June 6 Cabinet meeting made the National ID card number mandatory in 28 districts. People including federal lawmakers criticised the decision saying that it was enforced without first distributing the cards. In this context, Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Yubaraj Katel, director general of the Department of National ID and Civil Registration.Let’s begin with a basic question. Why do we need a National ID card while we already have citizenship certificate, driving license, passport and voting card?There is a fundamental difference between a citizenship card and National ID. Citizenship establishes whether you are a citizen of the country and it helps you identify yourself with some basic details. In Nepal, it was also widely used as a service card. Wherever you go, you have to show the citizenship card—to open a bank account or acquire a SIM card for a phone. If we study international practices, there are mainly two cards—one is an identity card and the other is a service card. In 2018, the Nepal government came up with the idea of distributing national identity cards with a unique digital number for each eligible citizen. The number can track not only the individual but also the person’s activities and movements. This project has various components. First is data collection. It has two categories—demographic data, such as the names of father, mother and other family members. Second is biometric data—fingerprints, eye retina and digital signature. The biometric data is crucial to create a unique identity of each individual and avoid duplication in the integrated national database. The National ID has these two types of data. The other tasks are enrollment of the data, printing and distribution of the cards and then providing services based on that. At present, people carry multiple cards in their pockets. The objective of this project is to replace all of them by a single card–National ID. The new card includes vital details of all other cards in its chip with 1GB storage capacity. The government wanted to trace people based on their unique individual numbers so that there is no need to print and carry multiple cards. There is a huge industry of printing separate cards for each and every service that is creating a jumble of information. The National ID will not only replace multiple cards but also help authorities control criminal activities like financial frauds by removing duplication. At present, government authorities have difficulty in tracing and identifying an individual and wrongdoers are benefitting from that situation.What cards will be replaced by the National ID?It has a chip with 1GB storage capacity where you can store your driving license, academic documents, voting card, insurance details, ATM card number, etc. For instance, if you go to a telecom company to acquire a SIM card, they will ask for a copy of your citizenship card. You can say, ‘no, I have a National ID card’. Once you give your number and fingerprint, they can immediately verify it through the system. Another objective is to help people get rid of filling up pages of forms for each service. International governance has a norm that says don’t ask citizens their information more than once. A state agency should seek the information once and provide it to other state agencies if they require it. People complain that many agencies don’t accept National ID. They still ask for a citizenship card for official record and verification. So, in practice, it didn’t help people reduce the number of cards in their pockets. In fact, it added one more.Therefore, the June 6 Cabinet decision made the use of National ID cards compulsory in 28 districts. Now, it is going to be essential to get social security allowances, pensions and claim health insurance. The Health Insurance Board has said it has become challenging for them to verify whether a claimant is the rightful one. The board has 8 million policyholders. We will give them our details. Then, they can cross-check the authenticity of a claimant. This will help avoid huge financial frauds. In fact, the government should have made it mandatory earlier.But people including lawmakers in the federal parliament have strongly opposed the decision saying that the government made National ID mandatory without first distributing the cards to the people.Nepal’s total population is over 30 million. Our principal stakeholders are citizenship card holders. Those 16-year-olds are eligible for citizenship cards. The Election Commission distributes voting cards to those above 18 years. We got the data from the commission and added 20 percent and estimated that we have 18.6 people above 16 years old. As of Friday, we have already distributed the National ID numbers to 14.9 million people. Now, as per our estimate, around 3.7 million people are yet to get the National ID. Millions of people are abroad. Thus, we are headed towards saturation point in terms of data collection and issuance of the numbers. One thing I want to stress is that people don’t need a hard copy of the National ID card. The number is sufficient. Printing cards is costly. We have to pay around 2 euro to procure a blank card. The cost of printing, delivery and other overhead expenses is added to that. With the task of printing over a billion copies of ID cards being too costly, even India discourages use of hard copy of the cards. You can create the QR code of your card, save it in your mobile or print it in a paper and scan it wherever you need it.Officials at our government agencies bring up the rule that makes it mandatory to present a physical copy of citizenship card or other documents for official works.Yes, we are trained and habituated in that way. Now we need to change. We must make offices paperless while developing a strong database system. We have been using citizenship cards to verify the identity of a person for a long time. Biometrics not only helps identify people but also trace their activities. Recently, Rs2 billion was found in the bank accounts of a 26-year-old man. The money was deposited in 56 bank accounts. He used 13 ATM cards and 17 phone numbers. Once the National ID card is implemented, transactions and movements of such wrongdoers will be easily traced and monitored. Identifying individuals accurately is crucial to ensure good governance and strengthen security. Many people have acquired fake citizenship cards. People even made fake passports. Implementation of National ID will control it. It is also related to our national image. It will help improve the status of our passport and add authenticity to our other documents as well.Once the National ID comes into wide use, our details will be traced and used by multiple agencies. State agencies and other institutions benefit from the integrated database as they can easily trace us. But how do you ensure our data isn’t misused and it doesn’t make us insecure?If you have a National ID card, you don’t need a hard copy of your driving licence. There is a backlog of around 2.1 million licences. The government has failed to print and distribute them. We told them, we have already procured 12 million cards. Of them, 3.2 million cards have already been printed and we still need to print around 8 million cards. Once the licence data is integrated with the National ID card, it will be shown there. Now, to come to your question, only the traffic authority can access the licence-related data. The device they use will trace only relevant data. Only an authorised agency will get access to the data and it can’t be used for anything other than the stated purpose. We give access to agencies like Nepal Rastra Bank, Nepal Telecommunication Authority and Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal. Then they regulate the things in their domain. No unauthorised body or individual can access it. Do the implementing agencies have infrastructure to use this technology?We are in a position to implement it in some parts of the country. Therefore, we are implementing it in phases. We are making it mandatory for certain services in 28 districts from mid-July. We should have started much earlier. It must be expedited.Lawmakers said in a Parliament meeting that the decision has ‘terrorised people’ in the 28 districts as locals feared they might be deprived of the services as the government has made National ID cards mandatory without first distributing them.We started the National ID registration process from 2018. Registration teams reached in each local ward except in Mugu and Humla districts of Karnali. It was carried out as a campaign. Even after the drive’s completion, the registration process was open in all the 77 districts, 54 area administration offices and in palika (local unit) centres. We also had registration centres in major downtowns. We receive data of around 4,000 registrations a day. So, there has been sufficient initiative and enough time to encourage people to get the number. Besides, if anyone in the 28 districts are still to get the ID number, they still have three months to register.You said only an ID number but no hard copy was needed to access any kind of service, right?Exactly. There is no provision that states one should produce a hard copy to get any service. You give the number and your biometrics to verify that you are the right person. Then, the official can crosscheck it in the database within seconds.Do all the implementing agencies have the devices that read the National ID cards?We have distributed 4,200 machines that read the cards in 333 local units of the 28 districts. Likewise, we have asked other local units and districts and some agencies such as banks to procure the devices and we have given the specifications based on their requirements. A device costs just around Rs 1,500. You can enter the number and place your thumbprint on it. We have trained relevant officials from all the local units for the purpose.How many cards can the department print at present?We can produce 1,500 cards an hour. But now we are producing only 1,800 a day. We have the strength to distribute 30,000 cards a day but are distributing only 5,000 a day.Again the same question. Then why are people not getting the cards?There is some communication gap. People who registered in 2018 or 2019 haven’t contacted us. We are giving them priority to clear the backlogs. But people who are newly-registered are showing more interest. So, we need to strike the right balance.When will the department be in a position to distribute the cards to all the people?At present, we can print 100,000 cards a month. We have a space to double the capacity. Meanwhile, people have now shown more interest. By enhancing our facilities’ capacity, we can print the pending 8 million cards in the next 40 months.What about election cards? Do we need to register for that and get the voting cards?In fact, the Election Commission doesn’t need to collect data and issue cards. We will talk to them. As a constitutional body, we have to readily make the data available for them. In fact, the National ID Card system can help the commission make voting arrangements for the Nepalis abroad because it can accurately identify the right person and can immediately update the integrated system here in Nepal about the votes cast in any country. This card will be helpful in conducting fair elections because the biometric data stored in this system will be perfect bases to identify the people and instantly update the activities in the database.You have emphasised replacement of other cards by the National ID cards. How long may it take to do so?We plan on giving priority to three sectors—banking, civil aviation and telecom. People right now need to fill separate forms for these services that have irked the service seekers. We have asked the bankers to buy the devices. We as a supplier are ready. Now the stakeholders should be ready too. It will benefit them because it helps control frauds.What if I don’t register for the National ID card?In the first place, you will be deprived of social security funds, pension, insurance policies. Likewise, the government will gradually make the card compulsory to receive many other services such as driving licence, land transaction, telephone numbers, bank accounts. How do you assure that our data stored in this system isn’t misused?See, the current practices make you more vulnerable. Because multiple agencies take your data for various purposes. Do they have a system to protect the data and ensure that it isn’t misused? But when your data is stored only by a dedicated government agency, it will be more secure as the agency is specialised for that. When other authorised agencies seek data, we give them access only to the relevant one. We have a National Identity Management Information System (NIMIS). We have maintained three layers of security—L1, L2, L3—to ensure foolproof security of the data. There are three servers.Are we dependent on any foreign company for any related service?So far, only one international vendor is involved but we are cutting down its involvement as well, with a plan to ultimately replace it by our own agency. The vendor now helps transfer collected data to the printing machine through the Automated Biometric Identification System (ABIS). But our plan is to do so through our own government agency or local vendor. We do all the other tasks. Security printing is done within the office basement where every movement of people is monitored and recorded. \nPrithvi Subba Gurung, deputy general secretary of the CPN-UML, is one of the leaders who strongly lobbied for a federal system while the Constituent Assembly was writing the constitution between 2008 to 2015. Eight years after the adoption of the federal democratic republican constitution, the federal system, particularly the provinces, are widely being criticised for their supposed failure to deliver. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asks former Gandaki chief minister Gurung what went wrong in the course of implementing the federal system.The implementation of the federal system has faced several hurdles since its adoption. Most provinces have for months failed even to form the governments, let alone run them efficiently. Where is the problem?We have adopted a federal system but are working against its spirit. Provinces should run autonomously. On some key issues, federal leaders and the party’s central bodies may give some direction to their provincial bodies. But most provincial activities are still centrally-governed even years after the adoption of federalism. So, our practices aren’t in line with the system. The provincial governments shouldn’t have been affected by the changes in the federal coalition. Such problems were seen in India years ago. But they have learned from their experience. In our case, leaders of major political parties treated the provincial governments as party chapters. The provincial governments are formed and run as per the constitution and all the three tiers of the governments are autonomous. The high commands in our political parties aren’t ready to accept the new constitutional setup.Are the provincial leaders equally responsible as they seek Kathmandu’s nod before taking any important decisions?They seek the centre’s support because they are trained in that way. They are too dependent on the centre. You said India learned by experience and now provinces there work more autonomously. But, in Nepal, provinces are now witnessing more problems than during their first tenure, which is evident also in the difficulties in government formation in multiple provinces. Why couldn’t they learn from the five-year experience?Nepal’s leaders and political parties are still not committed to federalism. They have failed to implement the federal system as per the spirit of the constitution. This is the major problem. The big parties as well as their leaders are guided by a centralised mindset and still prefer working in a unitary system. We should not forget that we transformed the executive and legislative bodies into three tiers of federal systems. But our judiciary retained the old structure. Therefore, the judiciary doesn’t accept the federal system and its practice in a true sense. Its verdicts reflect the same.The role of Speakers and Province Heads has courted controversies in multiple provinces. The top court invalidated some of their decisions. Is it because of lack of clarity, faults in our constitutional provisions, or is it because of the leaders?Speaker and Province Head are political posts created in accordance with constitutional provisions. When overall politics is dirty and unhealthy, those taking up these responsibilities also feel compelled to resort to similar tactics. When overall politics improves, they automatically make better decisions. Mainly there is no leader in the high command who completely owns federalism and is determined to implement it in its true spirit. This government in its policies and programmes unveiled last month had rightly said that “protecting federalism and strengthening the federal democratic republic is our top priority”. But the budget failed to introduce programmes as per the promises made in the policies and programmes.How do we correct these anomalies? Where do we begin?We are in a complex situation. Many have started to float the idea of making amendments to the constitution. But we shouldn’t forget that various forces and stakeholders had their own positions during constitution-making. They made compromises and found middle grounds to promulgate the constitution. If we go for amendments, they all will return to their respective stances. Some may want to revive the Hindu Kingdom while others will stand against it. Some leaders even within Nepali Congress have started to advocate for constitutional monarchy. But we can’t regress to the monarchical system. We can’t renounce secularism and an inclusive democratic system. We can’t backtrack on our commitment to a socialism-oriented system. We may explore some changes in our electoral system or form of governance without going against these key features of our constitution but we can’t destabilise the charter. What are the major flaws to be fixed?There are some. For instance, provinces have no role in education. The responsibility of education up to secondary level is given to the local level. And, everything is controlled by the federal government. The local units are entrusted with key responsibilities such as developing curriculum, overseeing the issues of career developments of teachers and staffers and their promotion as well as transfers etcetera. Local units can’t do all of these things efficiently as they have their own limitations. How can a local unit transfer a teacher from Kaski to Lamjung? Provinces should have been given such responsibilities. The power has been centralised at Singha Durbar. Such is also the situation in other sectors.Though the proportional representation (PR) system is hailed as one of the most beautiful features of our constitution in terms of ensuring inclusion, it has also been blamed for political instability. Many have demanded revision in the electoral system.The major political parties such as the CPN-UML and Nepali Congress have not trained their party members on the proper implementation of key constitutional features such as federalism and electoral system. The party members and general people have either wrongly understood it, or have negative impressions about the systems. These systems were adopted with an objective to resolve our decade-long conflict and address the concerns of the historically marginalised communities and even mainstream some groups through an inclusive democratic system. The idea was to integrate all the communities and maintain unity in diversity. After holding years-long debates on various options, we agreed on the mixed electoral system so as to reflect our diversity in the state agencies.As the proverb goes, “the bad workman blames his tools”, our leaders are blaming the system for their failure to secure a majority by winning people’s trust. Many countries that practise similar electoral systems have progressed. Our electoral system and the form of governance are not causing political instability. Many countries have adopted a parliamentary system and many others have practised the presidential model. Countries have progressed in both the systems. Also, there are examples of failures under both setups. So, the problem lies in our political parties and leaders, not in the systems. Shouldn’t political parties like the UML and Congress work with a plan to secure a majority by winning people’s trust? They aren’t training their focus on that but blaming the system. At times, they have squandered the majority as well and have failed to keep the party intact. Isn’t it our [leaders’] failure?Some argue that the issue of the fractured mandate can be addressed by increasing the threshold ceiling for political parties to be eligible to get PR votes and that can be done by amending election laws. Does it help?This is the idea coming from big political parties because they get more votes when fringe parties disqualify for PR votes. But a higher ceiling may deprive many small parties from representing certain communities. So, this goes against the spirit of inclusion. What we need is a good coalition culture. If we see the trend of recent decades, Indian politicians have become much more mature in this context. In the past, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi accommodated his electoral alliance partners in his ruling coalition even though his party won the majority single-handedly. If we scrap the inclusive electoral system, won’t the marginalised communities again revolt? We should be careful about that.At times, leaders have helped dissident groups split their party. These are the same leaders who issued an ordinance to change the provision that required a group within a political party to show support of 40 percent members of the party’s central committee “and” the parliamentary party. Only then could it split. They changed the threshold to 20 percent, and the “and” provision had been changed to “or”. The provision of requiring 40 percent support on both sides had earlier been included to ensure political stability. But the leaders who are helping party divisions are blaming the system for instability in the country. So, we [leaders] have to mend our ways, not blame the system. The Rastriya Swantantra Party, the fourth-largest in the lower house, has officially said that it wants to overhaul the federal system and drastically downsize the provinces. Also, leaders within the major parties who earlier stood in favour of federalism have started criticising it. On Saturday, Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa said the country can’t sustain the provinces in their present form. What is your view?I am one of those who advocated for a federal system even before the first Constituent Assembly because Nepal is a country full of discrimination based on caste, class, region and religion. We advocated for the system to do away with these discriminations and find a system to maintain unity within diversity. Federalism is the best system to promote national unity as all groups get their own space as per their unique features. For instance, if you make multiple rooms in a building, you can give space and adjust more people. But if you keep many people inside a big room, they will have difficulties—no matter how big the room is. We should strengthen the federal system. We can’t regress.Then, why do many people see provinces as a burden?In Nepal, the federal system was projected as a structure that resulted in huge liability to the state coffers. But the facts don’t substantiate it. A local unit in the federal structure replaced many erstwhile Village Development Committees (VDCs). For instance, in my home district of Lamjung, eight palikas covered the areas of 61 VDCs, and the expenditure of the current eight local units is no more than that of the erstwhile 61 VDCs. Now we don’t need 77 district coordination committees. They can be scrapped. No province needs more than seven ministers. Likewise, the federal Cabinet can be drastically downsized. Why do we need a 25-strong Cabinet at the centre when we already have seven other provincial cabinets? Twelve ministries are enough at the centre, as suggested by the high level commission on administration reform.There are many departments and divisions that were designed under the unitary system that have become completely redundant in the federal setup. So many project offices established over two decades ago based on the needs of that time are still there. These irrelevant bodies should be scrapped. This is how we can significantly cut down on administrative costs. Leaders and people don’t discuss that. They only blame provinces. \nThe weather across the country is forecast to be partly to generally cloudy on Thursday.Light to moderate rain accompanied by thunder and lightning is expected in several regions, including Koshi Province, Madhesh Province, Gandaki Province, Lumbini and Bagmati Province.
