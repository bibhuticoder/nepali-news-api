Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nIt has been over a week since the Nepali Congress and CPN-UML agreed to form a new government under the leadership of the CPN-UML chair KP Oli, but they have yet to settle the ministry-wise portfolio division.Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who lost his majority after the UML and other parties withdrew their support, will face a vote of confidence on Friday as required by the constitution. This will be Dahal’s fifth floor test since becoming the prime minister in December 2022. It is almost certain that he will not secure the majority, which means President Ram Chandra Poudel will have to call for the formation of a new government. As soon as the prime minister fails the vote, Speaker Devraj Ghimire will inform President Poudel of the results. The UML is planning to claim the formation of the new government with the support of over two-thirds of the lawmakers, a central committee member of the party told the Post.But it is not clear whether the President will appoint Oli as the next prime minister after the UML submits the signature of the two-thirds lawmakers or he will give political parties one to three days to form a new government under Article 76 (3).President Poudel is consulting his team as well as his advisors, said an aide.As per the initial power-sharing agreement between Deuba and Oli, Congress will get 11 ministries and the UML will get 10. But as more parties have decided to extend support to Oli, they will need to accommodate other fringe parties in the government.Despite these preparations, the Congress and the UML have yet to finalise their nominees for ministers. Oli is likely to be sworn in on Tuesday once the prime minister election process is completed. Sources citing an informal agreement between the two parties said the Congress will lead the home and foreign affairs ministries, and the UML finance and defence ministries.“We are lobbying for General Secretary Gagan Thapa to lead the Congress team in the new government,” Bishwa Prakash Sharma, another general secretary of the party, told the Post. Thapa is interested to lead the Ministry of Home Affairs, but Congress chief Sher Bahadur Deuba wants Ramesh Lekhak as the new home minister, according to Congress leaders. “If Thapa leads another ministry, but is given the position of deputy prime minister, he should join the government,” said Sharma.Dozens of lawmakers have expressed their intent to become ministers this time, so the party’s leadership, including Deuba, is in a difficult situation regarding whom to send and whom not to.Deuba's spouse, Arzu Rana, is widely expected to be the next foreign minister. Other potential Congress ministers include Chandra Bhandari, Jeevan Pariyar, Tejulal Chaudhary, and Ajay Chaurasiya, among others. Besides Thapa, senior Nepali Congress leaders like Prakash Man Singh and Krishna Prasad Situala, among others, are also interested in leading the party in the new Cabinet, according to sources. General Secretary Sharma, however, told the Post that he would not join the new government. Singh, due to his senior position inside the party and the support he had extended in the past to help Deuba win the party presidency, president has a high chance of leading the Congress team in the government, if General Secretary Thapa does not join the government, according to Nepali Congress leaders. Thapa, has reportedly set some conditions, including deputy prime ministership, for him to lead the party’s team in the Oli Cabinet.Although Sharma claimed that they would lobby for Thapa, Thapa himself, speaking at a function in Biratnagar on Thursday, said he would not join the new government.“I have told the party leadership that I will work as general secretary and not join the government,” said Thapa.He also claimed that as soon as the process of forming the new government begins, the seven-point agreement signed between Oli and Deuba at midnight of July 1 will be made public.“We will discuss with the party president on Friday about sending the Congress team in the government under Thapa’s leadership,” said Sharma. However, UML chief Oli, who is all set to become the new prime minister, is reportedly against having the deputy prime minister portfolio this time. That is one major reason why the two parties have been unable to finalise the portfolio division.If the post of deputy prime minister remains, UML’s Bishnu Poudel, who previously served in that role, might be appointed deputy prime minister and finance minister, according to UML leaders. However, Oli is not keen on bringing Poudel into the Cabinet, according to the leaders. Padma Aryal, UML's party secretary, said a secretariat meeting of the party on Wednesday had already entrusted Oli with selecting ministers.There is also a long list of aspirants in the UML hoping to become ministers in the new Oli Cabinet. If the deputy prime minister portfolio is removed, Oli is likely to pick Rishikesh Pokhrel as the next finance minister, according to the leaders. Pokhrel is the chairman of the Public Account Committee of the House of Representatives. \nPushpa Kamal Dahal secured the vote of confidence in four consecutive tries after becoming the prime minister on December 25, 2022, but when he goes for his fifth on Friday, he is almost sure to fail.After CPN-UML, the largest coalition partner, withdrew its support to the government on July 3, Prime Minister Dahal has been leading the minority government.Soon after the UML withdrew its support, the Janata Samajbadi Party, led by Ashok Rai, also pulled the plug on the government. The CPN-UML has 77 seats and the newly formed Rai-led party has 7 seats in the House of Representatives.Dahal on July 5 decided to go for the floor test after the UML’s withdrawal of the support.Dahal opted for the floor test in accordance with Article 100(2) of the constitution which says, “If the political party which the prime minister represents is divided or a political party in coalition government withdraws its support, the prime minister shall table a motion in the House of Representatives for a vote of confidence within thirty days.”Dahal, who had the support of 268 lawmakers in his first attempt at a floor test, is likely to see that vote slashed by almost 200 this time.As things stood on Thursday, Dahal is most likely to get 32 votes from his CPN (Maoist Centre), 21 from the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) and 10 from the CPN (Unified Socialist).The parliamentary party meeting of Unified Socialist on Thursday decided to give Prime Minister Dahal the trust vote.Though the RSP has called a meeting of its parliamentary party on Friday morning, a party lawmaker said, “Since we have been continuing in the government despite being in a minority, we are morally bound to give the vote of trust to Prime Minister Dahal.”On July 4, RSP leaders had announced they’d quit the government but ministers from the party met the prime minister later that day and decided not to resign immediately. They said they backtracked on their plan after the prime minister sought their support until the floor test.To secure a majority in the 275-strong House, one needs 138 votes.The Congress and the UML, which have 88 and 77 House of Representatives seats, respectively, have already decided to vote against Prime Minister Dahal. Likewise, the Rastriya Prajantra Party, which has 14 seats, has also decided to vote against Dahal.The Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal, led by Upendra Yadav, and the Janata Samajbadi Party, led by Ashok Rai, which have 5 and 7 seats, respectively, have said they will vote against Dahal.The Loktantrik Samajbadi Party, which has four seats in the House, is also standing against Dahal during the floor test. “Our party is a member of the democratic alliance led by the Nepali Congress,” Ram Parkash Chaudhary, a lawmaker of the party, told the Post. “Therefore, we will vote against Prime Minister Dahal.”Dahal also will not get the trust vote of the Nagarik Unmukti Party. “Since our party has already withdrawn support to the Dahal government, our party will stand against him during the floor test,” Ranjita Shrestha, a lawmaker of the party, told the Post.The CK Raut-led Janamat Party, which has six seats in the lower house, will also stand against Prime Minister Dahal. “The party has already decided to stand against Prime Minister Dahal’s trust motion,” Abdul Khan, a lawmaker of the party, said.After the November 2022 election, Dahal, chief of the third-largest party in the House, continuously led the government for over one-and-a-half years exploiting the support of both the Congress and the UML, by turn. During this period, the UML backed Dahal two times while the Congress supported him once to form the government.Dahal first became the prime minister with the UML’s support. But the Congress was bent on breaking the UML-Maoist alliance and supported him in the vote of confidence after his swearing-in.After that, Dahal and Deuba started hobnobbing. When Dahal decided to support Congress candidate Ramchandra Paudel in the presidential election, the UML withdrew its support to the Dahal government on February 26, 2023.When Dahal faced the second floor test on March 20, he secured 172 votes in the House.Dahal, during the second trust vote, was supported by the Congress, Rastriya Swatantra Party, Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal (before the party split), Unified Socialist, Janamat Party, Loktantrik Samajbadi Party, Nagarik Unmukti Party, three independent lawmakers and a lawmaker of Rastriya Janamorcha.On March 4, Dahal broke its coalition with the Congress to join hands with the UML. He then went for the floor test for the third time on March 13.In his third floor test, Dahal received 157 votes from the UML, RSP, Janata Samajbadi Party, Unified Socialist, and Nagarik Unmukti Party, in addition to his own party.Meanwhile, Dahal again went for the floor test on May 20, for the fourth time, just two months after his third attempt. This time, he had to seek the parliament’s confidence after a group of seven lawmakers from his coalition partner Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal split the party and formed a new outfit under Ashok Rai’s leadership on May 5.After the party split, JSP-Nepal chair Upendra Yadav withdrew its support to the government. In the subsequent floor test, Dahal garnered 157 votes.Out of 12 political parties in the House of Representatives, along with the first and second largest parties—the Congress and the UML—other 10 parties and five independent lawmakers supported Dahal when he sought a vote of trust for the first time after the 2022 election.In the hung parliament, there are only two scenarios to form the government. Either the Congress and the UML should come together, or one of them should build the majority with the support of other fringe parties to form the government.This time, the Congress and the UML decided to forge a partnership despite the odds. As per the understanding between the two parties, UML chief KP Sharma Oli will lead a ‘national consensus government’ for a year and a half. After that, Sher Bahadur Deuba, the Congress president, will succeed him for the remaining term of the House. \nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that Nepal’s economy, still reeling from subdued domestic demand and post‑pandemic balance sheet repairs, may face an increasingly gloomy and uncertain outlook, mainly due to fragile political stability and cooperatives failure.The global lender, which provides policy advice and financing to its members to foster growth and financial stability, said Nepal’s fragile political stability could disrupt policy continuity and reform implementation. Nepal is set to elect the new prime minister next week. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is almost certain to fail the trust vote. This will be his fifth trust vote in a year and a half. The CPN-UML withdrew its support to the government on July 3 after it ditched its coalition with the CPN (Maoist Centre) and joined hands with the Nepali Congress to form a new government.This is the fourth time in Nepal’s political history that two major parties are forming a government without a powerful opposition, which observers say weakens democracy's effective functioning.On Tuesday, the IMF completed the fourth review under its four‑year extended credit facility, allowing Nepal to withdraw $41.3 million to help the country's economic recovery.This brings total disbursements under the extended credit facility for budget support to $247.7 million.The IMF executive board approved the extended credit facility arrangement for Nepal on January 12, 2022. The approved amount totals $371.6 million, which is 180 percent of Nepal’s special drawing rights quota (SDR) of 282.42 million.“Nepal’s economy continues to face challenges,” said the statement issued by the IMF on Thursday. It said that Nepal’s growth projected at 3 percent in the fiscal year 2023-24 remains below potential due to subdued domestic demand and post‑pandemic balance sheet repairs. The IMF has talked about Nepal’s cooperatives sector for the first time.In the statement, the IMF warned about the intensification of financial sector vulnerabilities, such as a further rise in non-performing loans. In this context, “more failures of cooperative lenders could endanger the banking system's soundness,” the IMF said.According to experts and bankers interviewed by the Post, cooperatives, which the government once embraced as one of the three pillars of the economy, are now threatening the economy.In Nepal, millions of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are heavily involved in cooperatives, and their failure could not only damage the fragile economy, but also harm social harmony, say experts. Cooperatives are involved in sectors ranging from dairy and livestock to tailoring and retail.Recently, thousands of victims of cooperatives fraud have staged protests in various parts of the country, demanding the return of deposits embezzled by cooperative operators. Hundreds of such depositors came to Kathmandu and staged protests. The government recently signed an agreement with them, promising to solve their problems as soon as possible.“The problem in the cooperative sector will shake up the banking sector. But if there is a wise move, the banking sector can absorb the shock,” said Upendra Poudyal, president of the Confederation of Banks and Financial Institutions Nepal. He said that the regulation of cooperatives has already been delayed. “We have seen that cooperatives are being operated for personal gains. A limited number of people took the benefit.” “Now, the central bank should begin with a single threshold. Limit the number and start supervision.” As of mid-March, there are 31,450 cooperatives in Nepal, with 7.38 million members. The deposit mobilisation in cooperatives amounted to Rs478 billion, while credit mobilisation stood at Rs405 billion. They currently employ 94,000 people.In a recent interview, Kashi Raj Dahal, immediate past chairman of the Crisis-ridden Cooperatives Management Committee, a government agency, told the Post that globally, most cooperatives work in productive sectors like food production, dairy, fruits and other agricultural activities. “But in Nepal, around 25,000 cooperatives are involved only in financial activities, mainly collecting deposits and issuing loans. Such cooperatives are now in crisis. Over 15,000 are registered to collect deposits. Even others registered as multi-purpose cooperatives primarily engage in savings and credits. Around 500 cooperatives are currently in trouble.”The Dahal-led government has promised the return of at least Rs500,000 to each depositor by recovering it from the directors' assets. Yet doubts persist about whether depositors will get back their money. Some economists have warned about potential mass protests if the cooperatives issue is not taken seriously.The IMF has also warned that the failure to raise the execution rate of large-scale projects would deprive the economy of much-needed stimulus and weigh on growth. On the pessimistic side, the IMF said that economic activity is expected to increase, reaching 4.9 percent in 2024-25, supported by more robust domestic demand. The statement reads that the cautiously accommodative monetary policy stance, the planned increase in capital expenditures in the 2024-25 budget, additional hydropower generation, and a continued rise in tourist arrivals are expected to boost domestic demand and growth. Inflation is expected to remain within the Nepal Rastra Bank’s (NRB) target ceiling of 5.5 percent.“Nepal has made important strides on its economic reform agenda. Decisive actions in monetary policy, bank regulation and rolling off Covid support policies played a major role in overcoming urgent balance of payments pressure in 2021-22,” said Bo Li, deputy managing director of IMF. “Reserves continue to rise without the need to use distortive import restrictions. Despite revenue shortfalls, fiscal discipline was maintained in 2022-23 and 2023-24. Bank supervision and regulation have improved by rolling out new supervisory information systems. Nepal’s medium-term outlook remains favourable as strategic investments in infrastructure, especially in the energy sector, are expected to support potential growth.”The IMF said that strengthening public investment management would support the needed boost to capital spending. Enhancing fiscal transparency will help contain fiscal risks and strengthen medium-term fiscal sustainability.“As monetary policy transmission is still weak in a context of balance sheet repair, a cautious and data-dependent monetary policy remains appropriate to preserve price and external stability,” the IMF said.  \nAmid an economic slowdown, the banking sector is looking for a slightly loose monetary policy to boost the confidence of the financial and private sectors, including individuals. The banking sector expects favourable working capital guidelines, which will open avenues for the financial industry and traders to increase their economic activities. In this context, the Post’s Krishana Prasain caught up with Upendra Prasad Poudel, chairman of Nabil Bank, to discuss the economy and the banking sector amid Nepal’s ballooning foreign exchange reserves and slowed lending. Excerpts:The monetary policy is due soon. What are the expectations of the banking industry?Our expectations from monetary policy are high as the country’s economy is going through a challenging situation. Some people say the economy is in crisis. But I don't call it a crisis because the external sector, including key economic indicators, is doing well. The country’s economy is looking for a boost—confidence where it will be easy for everyone to work in tandem. Our economic base is small. It will not take a long time for the economy to revive. In that background, we need a loose monetary policy to address everyone's needs.A loose monetary policy aims to stimulate economic activity and reduce unemployment by lowering interest rates and increasing the money supply. Without a loose monetary policy, building the private sector confidence is difficult. Liquidity is sufficient. To increase the credit demand, there is a need to boost consumption. To increase consumption, people need to have enough cash in their hands. That demands government and private sector investments. This depends on both fiscal and monetary policies. For instance, the construction sector is facing trouble, and as a result, there is not much economic activity with the government failing to pay the contractors. When contractors are not getting money, they are not giving it to workers. So the money is not reaching the people. As a result, consumption has remained stagnant. The government is not giving subsidies to agriculture or the insurance sector. We learn that the government needs more money. The private sector no longer trusts the government’s fiscal policy. In contrast, since the banking sector is regulated and disciplined, everyone looks up to monetary policy. Naturally, the private sector has high expectations from the central bank. What kind of policies are needed to revive the economy? As I said, public consumption needs to grow. To boost consumption, there is a need to increase credit. In the past, the banking sector made aggressive lending, but the credit did not go into the real economy or the productive sector. So, the central bank and commercial banks are now worried. Even though credit has seen a growth lately, the impact is not visible. At one level, the money needs to reach everyone's hands. So monetary policy needs to encourage credit flow. There is a slowdown in the banking industry, too. Banks are not able to offer dividends. Positive developments also exist. Interest has been cut, which will reduce capital costs, ultimately increasing output and consumption.Foreign exchange reserves are at a record high. Banks’ lending has yet to improve. What does this show?People are spending less. Reduced spending means that the demand for goods and services has declined. Even though the interest rate has declined, banks struggle to boost credit. As the foreign exchange rate increases, we have the space to increase imports. Banks have liquidity and the capacity to disburse funds. Interest rates are also declining, and the environment is becoming more conducive. But the demand for loans is a must. The confidence in the system must be high for the demand for loans to grow. The International Monetary Fund also indicates that Nepal’s situation may improve in the next fiscal year, depending on the monetary policy. What is sustainable banking? Why are Nepali banks reluctant to follow it?We look at sustainable banking in a futuristic way. We work for days beyond today. We work for tomorrow's generation. We work to make resources available for tomorrow. We must work to make everything sustainable. We have to preserve nature. Banks have gone for short-term profits. That's how we have deviated from sustainability. But our banks still need to go for sustainable practices. The central bank defines the productive sector including energy as the real economy. Investing in those sectors leads to sustainability.Our system ranks banks on the basis of profit, the number of depositors or the volume of loans. In reality, though, to be number one, the parameter should be the impact the bank has on the economy, environment, and society. Knowingly or unknowingly, everyone is talking about sustainable banking. Many banks have started reporting their carbon footprints. Many banks, including Nabil, have started various schemes for agriculture. There are products for women entrepreneurship for inclusive development and migrant workers as well. The banking sector needs to be aware of responsible investment. The central bank has been reinforcing this idea from time to time. How have cooperatives issues affected banks?As the financial system is interlinked, problems in the cooperative sector have impacted the banking sector directly or indirectly. Some cooperative deposits are with banks, and the bank's money has also gone to cooperatives. Not only cooperatives but some credit to loan sharks might have been sourced from banks, too. These are serious issues that need to be tackled prudently. We sense that the problem in the cooperatives sector will shake up the banking sector one day. The banking sector is highly regulated and has the capacity to absorb any shock, though it may not make a profit as before. Regulating cooperatives is difficult now: it’s already too late. The SME sector complains that getting bank loans isn’t easy. What can be done to increase credit flow?We are the custodians of depositors and cannot lend money to anyone easily. We draw a borderline to mitigate possible risk. Lack of financial literacy is still prevailing, and we have been working to create awareness. The financial sector has become transparent, but the private sector hasn’t. The government needs to create an environment that makes businesses transparent. The banks have started taking steps to develop and scale up entrepreneurship. Such initiative needs to be taken by the government, including the local level. The growth in entrepreneurship will stop our youths from going abroad. The government needs to spend heavily on developing entrepreneurship by supporting startups. Nepal has started cross-border digital payment. How has the banking sector started preparation, especially on the operating side?Banks have made a giant leap in terms of digital payment. Certain levels of credit are being approved online. Bank accounts are opened online, and security documents are automatically generated. We have moved ahead in the information and technology systems in the banking sector. However, we are still in the infancy when it comes to the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in the banking sector. To make transactions with India more comprehensive, we need support from Indian regulators, especially in preventing illegal transactions. With proper regulations and support, digital payments will boom. \nThe reconstruction of Achham Durbar, a historical palace in Mangalsen severely damaged by Maoist bombing during the insurgency, nears completion after 16 years.The local people are elated to see the palace being restored to its original shape and style. “The Achham Durbar is an identity of Mangalsen and the entire Achham district,” said Khagendra BK, a local resident. “The locals were anxious as the reconstruction work had commenced six years after the palace was damaged, and the work was delayed under various pretexts.”The historical palace was severely damaged when the Maoist insurgents bombed it on February 16, 2002. In the explosion, a total of 122 people were killed, including the then Chief District Officer Mohan Singh Khatri.In 2008, the government had allocated Rs22.5 million for the reconstruction of the palace, originally built in the style of Kathmandu’s Hanuman Dhoka Durbar. Locals say the reconstruction work was affected by political pressure and negligence of the contractor, among other things. BK said that major political parties repeatedly raised the issue of the palace reconstruction during election campaigns but forgot it afterwards. “The political parties here have made the palace an election agenda. Now, when it appears that the construction is almost complete, they are trying to take credit saying it was possible because of them,” he said. “The palace is almost ready. The remaining work should not be stopped under any pretext.” The palace, also known as Mangalsen Durbar, sits in the middle of the Mangalsen market. “Since the palace was destroyed, the entire market seems incomplete and quiet,” said 80-year-old Kapure Nagarjee, a resident of Mangalsen. “Even though it took years to rebuild, the palace looks just like how it used to. This palace is connected to the history of Achham. It feels like history has come alive rather than just being a reconstructed palace,” he said.The historical palace is being rebuilt under the supervision of the Department of Archaeology. As the project nears completion, discussions have started about its use and ownership. Padam Bahadur Bohara, mayor of Mangalsen Municipality, said now there should be a discussion about who will own it. “Government offices including the district administration office and the police office were housed in the palace when it was destroyed. Separate buildings for these offices are being built now,” said Bohara. “The palace can be used as a museum. But what should be kept in it. All the historical artefacts inside the durbar were destroyed in the attack. It is better to use the palace as an administrative office of Magalsen Municipality.”Chief District Officer of Achham, Shiva Prasad Lamsal, said that his office has been overseeing the construction work and the palace will be ready by the Dashain festival, which falls in the month of October. “The roof of the palace has been covered. So work can continue even when it’s raining,” he said. “The authorities and stakeholders should sit together and formulate operational guidelines for the management and protection of the palace.” Currently, about 90 percent of the reconstruction work is complete.For the reconstruction of the palace, a contract was signed in 2010 with five construction companies namely Rajendra, Saud, Tulchidurga, Badimalika and Kuwar. In the beginning, work was delayed as Meen Bahadur Kuwar was authorised to carry out the work, but other companies left after receiving some payments. Currently, Rajendra and Saud Construction are in charge of the construction. Jaya Bahadur Saud, director of Saud Construction, said the difficulty in sourcing the specific wood needed for the old structure has been causing some delays.Earlier, the palace housed various offices including the district administration office, land revenue office, district court, among others. But at the time of the Maoist attack, only the district administration office was there. In the incident, 122 people including 53 soldiers, 59 policemen, two civil servants including the chief district officer, and eight civilians were killed. The construction of Achham Durbar began 150 years ago during the reign of the local king TikaBhuk Shah of Magalsen and was completed in around 1878 during the reign of his son Dal Bahadur Shah. According to Surat Bahadur Shah, an expert on Achham’s history, the government bought the palace for Rs90,000 from Yogendra Bahadur Shah, the son of the Achham king, in 1972. Yogendra Bahadur's brother, Tapendra Bahadur Shah, who was an army general, facilitated the sale of the palace to the government.The original palace was a three-storey building 20 metres long and 16 metres wide, with 30 rooms. \nThe plan to pass three budget-related bills from the National Assembly failed on Thursday following a tussle between the ruling and opposition parties.Discussions and endorsement of the Finance Bill, Bill to Mobilise National Loans, and Tax-related Bill were on the agenda. But the meeting was deferred till Sunday.On June 30, when the CPN-UML was still part of the ruling alliance, the House of Representatives had endorsed the three bills through majority votes. They were then forwarded to the Assembly for discussion and endorsement.The bills would have been endorsed without any hiccup if it was not for the dramatic ‘political deal’ between the Nepali Congress and the UML on July 1, when the two largest parties decided to form a new government to replace the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led administration.The UML subsequently exited the Dahal government and took the opposition benches in the federal parliament.After preliminary discussions, Bhagwati Neupane, the UML chief whip in the upper house, registered an amendment to the Finance Bill. The ruling alliance is short of a majority in both houses as the Congress, the UML, the Janata Samajbadi Party (JSP) and the Loktantrik Samajbadi Party (LSP) have stood against the Dahal government.The four parties coming together means Neupane’s amendment bill would be endorsed proving that the Dahal government lacks majority. “The National Assembly was postponed in the fear that the amendment bill would be endorsed. Narayan Dahal, the chairperson, has colluded with the Maoist Centre to defer the meeting without consultation with other parties,” said a UML lawmaker. “The withdrawal of the amendment bill was the condition that the finance minister had set for tabling the budget related bills.”Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun was supposed to table the bills at the meeting.The tussle between the ruling and the opposition spilled into the public after the opposition parties and Pun issued statements and counter statements attacking each other. Issuing a joint statement, the chiefs of four opposition parties claimed that postponement of the meeting was a product of a malafide intention to bar the deliberations on the budget related bills in the National Assembly.“Postponement of the House meeting has hampered our constitutional and legal authority to comment [on the bills] and register amendments. We strongly condemn such irresponsible moves,” reads the joint statement. They have accused that the postponement decision was taken unilaterally without consulting them.National Assembly Chairperson Dahal was elected to the position on the Maoist Centre quota.The budget related bills are considered to have been endorsed if the upper house fails to take a decision on them within 15 days of receiving them. The opposition parties have alleged that the government wants the legal deadline to pass without holding discussions so that the bills get endorsed automatically.“The amendment was registered to revise the provision that promotes tax evasion amounting in billions of rupees,” reads the joint statement. “The minister avoided the meeting fearing that his conspiracy for policy corruption would be exposed.”Pun’s secretariat was quick to counter the joint statement saying he had informed Parliament and the Assembly chair that the bills will be discussed on Sunday and a decision on whether to endorse it would be taken the same day.Issuing a statement, his secretariat rubbished the allegations levelled by the four parties. It also raises a question over the UML’s intention to register an amendment to the bill that it had endorsed without questions in the lower house.“Whether the move to register the amendment to the bill by the party that endorsed it in the House of Representatives is ethical or falls under parliamentary culture is a matter of serious concern,” reads his statement.The Maoist Centre said the opposition parties were politicising the budget for their petty interests. “The House meeting was postponed as the finance minister had pre-committed tasks to accomplish,” Gopi Achhami Sarki, the Maoist Centre chief whip in the upper house, told the Post. “There was no need to make a fuss as the deliberations will be held on Sunday.”All the budget related bills must be endorsed from the upper house at least a couple of days before the commencement of the new fiscal year, which begins on Tuesday. After their endorsement by the Assembly, the bills need to be approved by the lower house before they are sent to the President’s Office for authentication. \nPrime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is all set to go today. After being taken for a ride turn-by-turn by a distant third CPN (Maoist Centre) led by Dahal, the two big parties in Parliament—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—have joined hands to form a coalition government. And with this, Dahal, who remained at or around the power centre for almost a decade even with his party performing poorly in polls, is pushed to the periphery—at least for a while. The overzealous commentaries about Dahal being thrown off the grid of power may, however, be premature. As per the current constitutional provisions, coalition culture is here to stay. And considering how adamant the political parties are in sticking to their morally corrupt politics, no one can tell if the impending Congress-UML coalition stays for the next three months or three years. As Dahal goes today, there does not seem to be much point assessing how well his coalition with the UML fared in just four months of its existence. It takes decades, even centuries, to build a nation. The five-year term of Parliament is the minimum required for a set of leaders to make some impactful decisions for the country. There certainly are provisions for changes in the government, even in the midst of the parliamentary term, but these should be exceptional cases. What we have got, however, is a perpetuity of the coalition culture. It is this perpetuity that has halted the nation-building process for decades now. With the same set of three old men playing the hot potato game around power, nation-building has become a staccato performance at best. Just as one performer comes to the stage and starts his performance, he is pushed to the sidelines in the middle of the act.Pushpa Kamal Dahal will perform the last scene of the four-month act that was his coalition. He will come on stage, search for UML chairperson KP Sharma Oli among the audience, and call him a betrayer. He will then look for the Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba and blame him for being power-hungry. Oli and Deuba will then take the stage by turns and blame Dahal for trying to take them for fools. Such acts have been repeatedly performed, with the same set of plots, performances and actors. There is certainly a new actor on the block, a television presenter who thought he had had enough of shouting out of the small screen. He stepped out of the screen into the field and competed with the old guards whose noses he wanted to break—as his infamous saying went.The moment Rabi Lamichhane came to the spotlight after an impressive electoral showing, the masks he had worn all along started falling off. After a while, he became the fourth old man in the club of politicians who see fault in everyone else besides themselves. Only that Lamichhane was louder, more contemptuous of the media, and as directionless as the other three when it came to envisioning a future for the nation. As Dahal is forced to step down and Oli is about to take the helm, it is worth pondering if this sordid cycle of drama will end anytime soon.  \nThere is a growing public outcry over rampant corruption in Nepal. People believe that corruption is widespread and institutionalised and involves political parties, senior government officials, local elected representatives, business communities and civil societies. New scandals seem to emerge constantly, with the government stepping up efforts in some cases but arresting only a few individuals involved, who are released soon after. Only junior officials or ordinary individuals are charged and made accountable, sparing the key masterminds and those with influence, party leaders, or senior government officials.Given the scale, magnitude and possible involvement of the highest level of political leadership and their patronage in the scandals, the public’s concern is that the institutions established to control corruption have become dysfunctional with the meddling of senior party or government officials or prominent business people. These institutions are primarily headed by individuals with patronage from the political party leadership, who protect the perpetrators manipulating the institution’s functioning. Furthermore, given that we have a united government with continued political negotiations taking place, there may be threats to pull down the government if certain give-and-takes are not met; thus, it is unlikely that any action will be taken against anyone involved. Deputy Prime Minister and senior political leader Narayan Kaji Shrestha recently stated that if the political party members are accused of corruption, the party leadership will complain and threaten the government to pull out their support. If any civil servants are arrested, the protest comes from civil service unions with threats of street-wise demonstrations. Similarly, if those controlling the economy are accused of wrongdoing, they accuse the government of taking steps to destroy the economy. He stated that all political parties, government and business people are wary of punishing their groups of wrongdoers. He questioned whether the government should punish only ordinary people, street vendors, small businessmen, labourers, or poor people if this is the case. He emphasised that it is impossible to have a clean government without real unity and united efforts by all parties to address corruption. Failure in sustainable developmentA massive increase in corruption continues to threaten the country's overall development, including jobs, infrastructure, health, human development, quality of life for every citizen and overall governance. Employment opportunities are less available in the absence of foreign investments and new industries. Lest we forget, some 75,000-80,000 people leave the country every month, seeking employment abroad. The quality of education in government schools has deteriorated significantly, with only 36 percent passing the latest SEE. Around 100,000 students went abroad for studies in 2023-24 and will most likely not return home. Nepal is bound to lose a new generation of skilled and educated workforce. Reputated public hospitals have become dysfunctional due to the non-availability of medicine, non-functional equipment and the absence of qualified medical professionals, who are often frustrated by a lack of prospects and seek employment abroad. Many private hospitals and educational institutions have been established but are beyond the reach of the vast majority.None of the major road projects have been completed on time in recent years. They often double the timeline, overshoot the budget and use substandard work, resulting in substantial economic loss and prolonged inconvenience and suffering to citizens due to bad road conditions, dust pollution and long travel times. Government offices providing basic services, such as the issuance of driving licenses and passports, are notorious for delayed services.Major scandalsSeveral major scandals that have been in the limelight in the country include gold smuggling, Bhutanese refugee scams, land properties surrounding the PM Office, the Ncell/Axiata sale case, OMNI-Covid-related purchases, the Giribandu Tea Estate case, Cooperative scandals and many more involving hundreds of millions of dollars. The main concern is that the real culprits are walking free, as they are part of the political leadership or individuals with solid party connections. As The Kathmandu Post put it in its recent editorial, “Rotten to the Roots”, indicating high local level corruption and “representatives have copied the ways of their federal leaders”. It is reported that out of 28,000 cases filed by the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA), half of the cases were at the local units in one year. Several such officials were recently reportedly suspended, and thus the local institutions cannot function, potentially threatening the whole process of devolution of power from the centre. Whether local units seriously lack good governance and fiscal transparency also needs to be verified and acted upon.Partnership against corruptionIt is gratifying that Nepal enjoys good friendship and cooperation with many countries, multilateral organisations and the UN, which have been keenly supporting Nepal’s sustainable development, peace processes and democratic transformation. Twenty-five years into the democratic process, there have been significant achievements and friends of Nepal should be proud of their partnerships and cooperation. Nepal is very fortunate that around 26 percent of the annual government budget is supported by development partners. Nepal is at a turning point, with its citizens increasingly concerned about intuitional corruption and the cartel system. In the absence of serious political commitments and weakness in government institutions, the situation risks further deterioration. This situation goes against the people’s aspirations for the overall sustainable development of Nepal, with a threat to security, stability and hard-earned democracy, devolution of power to the local level and failure to achieve the country’s graduation from LDC status. In 2014, major development partners and the UN joined together to remind the Nepali government of their concern regarding rising corruption. Leakage in aid leads to a trust deficit among donors, who continue to develop their strategies and find their way of delivering aid at the cost of the overall impact of development support. Nepal has ratified the 2011 UN Convention Against Corruption, so the government should take all measures to fight corruption. The current situation strongly requires development partners and multilateral institutions, including the UN, to continue to voice their concerns about the institutionalisation of corruption and closely engage with the government in supporting anti-corruption measures on multiple fronts. The outcomes of these efforts will have significant impacts, giving rise to greater values in development aid and across different sectors. Way forward Nepal should ensure that its citizens trust its intentions regarding good governance processes, and all known scandals must be transparently resolved. All governance institutions, such as the CIAA, should be reviewed to make them more effective and fully accountable. Every government public service should be improved through digitisation and targeted timelines, including, for example, the delivery of all pending driving licenses. The development partners must raise concerns about corruption and support the government in strengthening its accountability and transparency process with a robust digital system and other technical assistance. The government should occasionally provide exclusive briefings to the public, media and development partners on the measures it is taking to control corruption.  \nFatal attractions are a standard movie plotline, but they also occur in nature, with much more serious consequences. As a conservation biologist, I’ve seen them play out in some of Earth’s most remote locations, from the Gobi Desert to the Himalayan Highlands.In these locales, pastoralist communities graze camels, yaks and other livestock across wide ranges of land. The problem is that often these animals’ wild relatives live nearby, and huge, testosterone-driven wild males may try to mate with domestic or tamed relatives.Both animals and people lose in these encounters. Herders who try to protect their domestic stock risk injuries, emotional trauma, economic loss and sometimes death. Wild intruders can be displaced, harassed or killed.These clashes threaten iconic and endangered species, including Tibetan wild yaks, wild two-humped camels and Asia’s forest elephants. If the wild species are protected, herders may be forbidden from chasing or harming them, even in self-defense.Human-wildlife conflict is a widely recognized challenge around the world, but clashes in these remote outposts receive less attention than those in developed areas, such as pumas ranging into US exurbs. As I see it, protecting threatened and endangered species won’t be possible without also helping herders whose lives are affected by conservation policies.The drive to mateThe force driving these raids is pure biology. All domestic animals are descended from wild ancestors. Steeped in evolution, natural selection has favoured males who inseminate the most females—and females who leave reproductive offspring of their own. Attractions can go both ways: Sometimes smaller or less aggressive domestic males may mate with wild females.Many herding societies contend with this challenge. In the Hindu Kush mountain system of Central Asia and farther east, Tibetans, Uyghurs, Changpa and Nepalis raise domestic yaks, which provide meat, milk, transportation and shaggy hides for clothing.Wild yaks were once thought extinct in Nepal, until a team led by wildlife biologist Naresh Kusi rediscovered them in 2014. Now aggressive contests between domestic and wild yaks are headaches for local herders.In Africa, Namib Desert mountain zebras, a vulnerable species, have been bred by donkeys. In northern China and Mongolia, domestic and reintroduced Przewalski horses coexist in tense zones where herders work to prevent genetic exchanges. In Southeast Asia, wild cattle species, such as gaur and banteng, have mixed extensively with domestic cattle and buffaloes.In northern realms, caribou and reindeer, which are the same species, Rangifer taranadus, both occur in wild forms. Reindeer have also been domesticated and are central to Indigenous herding cultures in Scandinavia, Russia, Canada and Alaska. Caribou slaughters and separation efforts have not prevented mixing.In temperate zones of Europe and Asia, native species such as ibex, or wild goats, and argali, the world’s largest wild sheep, cause trouble by mingling with domesticated goats and sheep. In South America, guanacos—relatives of wild camels—range from sea level to the snow line in the Andes and attempt to interbreed with domestic llamas.The wild and the tameAcross Earth, humans raise about 5 billion head of livestock. In most places, wild ancestors are long gone, so herders don’t have to contend with interbreeding.The wild relatives that survive typically are rare or endangered. For example, there are about 43 million domestic donkeys, also known as asses, worldwide. But in the Horn of Africa, the sole remaining spot with native ancestors, fewer than 600 wild asses survive today.The same asymmetry exists in the Himalayan Highlands, where wild yaks—a critically important species for Tibetan people—are estimated to number perhaps 15,000 to 20,000, compared with 14 million domestic yaks. Globally, for each wild Bactrian camel, there are about 2,500 domesticated brethren.Even in protected areas of northern India, western Mongolia and western China, the abundance of domestic livestock outnumbers that of hoofed wildlife by a factor of about 19 to 1.As wild populations shrink, the remaining males have smaller mating pools, which makes them more likely to pursue domestic females. But hybridizing with domestic animals could lead to some wild animals’ extinction as genetically distinct species.No easy resolutionFor pastoralists, earning a living along Earth’s rarified edges is hard enough without wild animals raiding their herds. Frequently, the only legal weapons herders can use to defend their livestock or themselves are sticks and stones. Guns are rare and often illegal, either because the wild species is protected or because the nation bans or restricts gun ownership.Global conservation policy recognizes herders’ plight. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature, a network of governments and nongovernmental organizations that work to conserve life on Earth, affirms that Indigenous peoples play key roles in protecting threatened species and maintaining these wild animals’ genetic purity.Many relevant national governments also support both protecting wild species and aiding nomadic herders, at least in principle. These broad goals aren’t always upheld at the local level, however, especially when the people in question are pastoralists living in remote areas where it’s hard to access government help.Coexistence in a crowded worldWhen pastoralists need to protect their herds from other threats, such as snow leopards, brown bears or wolves, their main options are putting up fences, avoiding areas where carnivores are known to be present or killing the predators. Herders also castrate their domestic animals to keep them from fighting with other animals in the herd or attacking humans.None of these options work well for dealing with wild progenitors of species such as yaks and camels. Castrating wild males or reducing their geographic ranges makes it harder to protect and increase threatened species.Fencing is harmful because it can keep wild grazers from moving seasonally to different habitats. Wildlife migrations aren’t just important for the herd: As the animals roam and graze across broad areas, they fertilize grasslands. Arming pastoralists against wayward and aggressive wild males may seem justified, but destroying endangered species is a poor conservation path.Respect for Indigenous peoples’ traditional cultural practices is important. So are international agreements to protect biodiversity. In my view, these human-wildlife clashes demand serious discussions that bring together herders, conservationists and local and national governments to develop pragmatic strategies.Without creative solutions to prevent intermingling, more iconic animals will follow the disappointing paths of wild reindeer, bison and other wild species struggling to thrive as they increasingly collide with human societies.-The Conversation \nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has recently come under fire, both in India and abroad, for hugging Russian President Vladimir Putin even as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine shows no sign of ceasing. As expected, among the fiercest critics of the infamous hug is Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who called it a “huge disappointment and a devastating blow to peace efforts”. As Putin continues to be made a pariah by the Western world for his continued attack on Ukraine, India under Modi has made it clear that the world’s largest democracy cares more about the India-Russia military-industrial complex than international humanitarian concerns. Ordinary Indians do not seem to care about the intricacies of the Modi-Putin deal for arms trade. But they certainly do about the fact that Modi has convinced Putin to return the Indians who have been fighting Russia’s war against Ukraine. Like Nepalis, Indians, too, have been lured into joining the Russian Army. Like the Nepalis, Indian recruits have realised that the war is no walk in the park, that their agents sold them false dreams, and they now want to return home. Like the Nepalis, the Indians, too, have been killed in the senseless war, although in lesser numbers. According to Indian media, at least four Indians have been killed, while between 30 and 40 others are serving in the Russian Army. In contrast, a staggering 35 Nepalis have been killed in the war, while around 150 are still on the battlefield, waiting for the Nepali state to intervene and ensure their homecoming. Apart from returning those alive, Russia has also offered to expedite compensation to the families of the deceased Indian recruits. This is in sharp contrast to the fate of the deceased Nepalis, whose families have yet to receive any compensation. It has been months since the families of the fallen Nepalis started lobbying, demonstrating and organising sit-ins to put pressure on the government to take up the matter with its Russian counterpart. Government officials, including various foreign ministers, have claimed to be coordinating with Russian officials to repatriate the Nepali recruits. But the results are for all to see: Russia has turned a deaf ear to all such pleas.Notably, the recent agreement between Modi and Putin, which has yet to be made public, is the result of continuous homework by Indian government officials rather than just an outcome of Modi’s dinnertime charm offensive with Putin. The Indian Embassy in Moscow was consistently raising this issue. Likewise, Foreign minister S. Jaishankar was making a strong case for it in his meeting with the Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation in Astana, Kazakhstan, last week. This shows how the Indian government has been using multiple channels to ensure the repatriation of its citizens. Having faced almost 10 times the number of Indian casualties, Nepal’s plight is comparatively more dire. Nepal must, therefore, double up its efforts by putting diplomatic pressure, even using Russia’s allies, including India, to expedite the return of the Nepalis. First, Nepal must again summon the Russian ambassador to Nepal, Aleksei Novikov, and make him answerable for Russia’s failure to repatriate Nepali citizens becoming collateral damages in its senseless war with Ukraine. Of course, we don’t expect Pushpa Kamal Dahal and his government to wield the kind of diplomatic clout of Modi and his country, the fifth largest economy in the world. What galls is that the Nepali state has been unable to harness even its limited diplomatic apparatus for such a noble and urgent cause.  \nForeign Secretary Sewa Lamsal attended the Second BIMSTEC Foreign Ministers’ Retreat being held in New Delhi on Thursday.During the retreat session, Lamsal reaffirmed Nepal’s unwavering commitments to carry forward BIMSTEC process and stressed on enhanced collaborative efforts among member states to realise shared objectives of sustained peace, stability, and prosperity in the Bay of Bengal region. “She further emphasised that Nepal will continue pursuing a ‘whole of the region’ approach to harness resources for common benefits, strengthen institution-building processes, and transform BIMSTEC into an effective, results-oriented regional forum,” the Embassy of Nepal in New Delhi said.The foreign secretary also highlighted the importance of leveraging synergies of South Asia and South-East Asia to ensure tangible benefits to the people of the region and addressing pressing challenges including climate change, health-related pandemics, natural disasters and transnational organised crimes, reads the press release issued by the embassy.Lamsal also called on Indian Minister for External Affairs S Jaishankar and Hasan Mahmud, foreign minister of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh, separately. The discussions focused on various aspects of cordial and cooperative bilateral relations, including regional cooperation within the BIMSTEC forum. Foreign Secretary Lamsal is scheduled to join foreign ministers and heads of delegations of BIMSTEC member states for a joint call on Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the latter’s office in New Delhi today. \nUkraine on Thursday urged NATO allies to lift restrictions on its use of long-range weapons against targets in Russia, saying that would be “game-changer” in its war with Moscow, while China slammed NATO criticism of its support for Russia as biased and malicious.NATO members issued a declaration in support of Ukraine at a summit in Washington on Wednesday, promising additional aid and pledging to back its “irreversible path” to NATO membership.“At this summit we are turning a corner and putting in place the foundations for Ukraine to prevail,” NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told a news conference after a three-day meeting in Washington of the 32 NATO states.“Today, we send a strong message of unity and resolve to Moscow that violence and intimidation do not pay, and that Ukraine can count on NATO now for the long haul.”Zelenskiy earlier called on allies to preserve their unified support of Ukraine and said new aid had to be delivered quickly.“If we want to win, if we want to prevail, to save our country and to defend it, we need to lift all the limitations,” he said.Zelenskiy’s cabinet chief Andryi Yermak told a public forum Russia had no restrictions on its use of weapons and it would be “a real game-changer” if Ukraine’s allies could lift all limits on the use of those they supply to Ukraine.NATO members have taken different approaches to how Ukraine can use weapons they donate. Some have made clear Kyiv can use them to strike targets deep inside Russia while the United States has taken a narrower approach, allowing its weapons to be used only just inside Russia’s border against targets supporting Russian military operations in Ukraine.Biden told the press conference the United States had allowed Zelenskiy to use American weapons in a limited way within Russia’s borders.Biden said he and US military and intelligence officials were making decisions on “a day-to-day basis on how far they should go in. That’s a logical thing to do.’The United States and its allies have used this week's summit to try to project unity in the face of what they see as a rising threat to Europe from Russia and China.However, NATO member Hungary said ahead of a meeting of NATO members with partners from the so-called Indo-Pacific Four - Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea - that it does not want NATO to become an “anti-China” bloc, and will not support it doing so.Hungary’s Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto also told Hungarian state television that Ukraine’s admission to the military alliance would weaken unity in the group.Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban irked other NATO members with surprise visits to Kyiv, Moscow and Beijing in the past two weeks on a self-styled “peace mission”. He and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump will meet on Thursday at the latter’s Florida home, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.Orban’s meeting in Moscow with Russian President Vladimir Putin in particular angered some fellow NATO allies, who said the trip handed legitimacy to Putin’s claims to Ukrainian territory seized since Russia’s 2022 invasion.Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, told a public forum he would not speculate on whether Orban’s trip to Moscow was coordinated with Trump, Biden’s rival in the November US election, but said the Ukrainians had grave misgivings about any effort to negotiate a peace deal without them.“So whatever adventurism is being undertaken without Ukraine’s consent or support is not something that’s consistent with our policy, the foreign policy of the United States,” he said.ANGRY WORDS FROM CHINAWednesday’s NATO declaration included sharp words about China, calling it “a decisive enabler” of Russia’s war in Ukraine, and said Beijing continues to pose systemic challenges to Europe and to security.China’s Foreign Ministry said the declaration was biased and “sowing discord” and its mission to the European Union described it as being “full of Cold War mentality and belligerent rhetoric, and China-related content full of provocations, lies, incitement and smears.”At the news conference, Stoltenberg recalled language in the declaration by saying that “China cannot continue to fuel the largest military conflict in Europe without this impacting Beijing's interests and reputation.”China has repeatedly lashed out at NATO criticisms and has warned against its expansion into the Indo-Pacific.Japan, South Korea, New Zealand and Australia have forged stronger ties with NATO amid rising concerns over China’s pressure on rival claimants in disputed waters in the region and on democratic Taiwan, the global hub of cutting-edge chip production, which Beijing claims as its own. \nThe weather today will be generally to mostly cloudy throughout the country.Koshi, Madhesh, Bagmai, Gandaki and Lumbini provinces are expected to experience heavy to very heavy rainfall at a few places heavy rainfall has also been forecast at one or two places in Karnali and Sudurpaschim provinces.Light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is likely to occur across the country.The weather is likely to remain the same until later tonight.Heavy rainfall may continue in Koshi, Madhesh and Gandaki provinces while light rainfall is likely to occur in some places of Bagmati province.Dipayal recorded a maximum temperature of 35.7 degrees Celsius on Thursday while Jomsom had a minimum temperature of 15.5 degrees Celsius. \nMonsoon-induced disasters have claimed the lives of 88 people across Nepal in the past month.According to Nepal Police, as of Thursday, floods, landslides, and other monsoon-induced disasters killed 25 people in Gandaki Province, 23 in Lumbini, 19 in Koshi, seven in Sudurpaschim, six in Bagmati, and four each in Madhesh and Karnali provinces.Likewise, 106 people were injured across the country, including 31 in Koshi Province, 26 in Gandaki, 15 in Karnali, 11 in Sudurpaschim, nine in Lumbini, and seven each in Madhesh and Bagmati provinces.According to Nepal Police, six people are missing due to floods and landslides across the country. Two each are missing in Koshi and Bagmati provinces and one each in Gandaki and Sudurpaschim provinces. Search and rescue operations are currently underway to locate the missing individuals.A total of 161 houses, 68 sheds, 41 bridges, one school, and two government offices were damaged during the period, which displaced 3,462 households and killed 479 cattle.Meanwhile, the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology has forecast extremely heavy rainfall in some places of the country until Saturday morning.According to a special bulletin issued by the department, most parts of the country will witness light to moderate rainfall and some places could see extremely heavy rainfall until Saturday morning.Some places of Koshi, Madhesh, Gandaki, and Lumbini provinces could witness rain with thunder and lightning in that period. Extremely heavy rainfall is likely in some places of the four provinces.Red alerts have been issued in 43 districts of Koshi, Madhesh, Bagmati, Gandaki and Lumbini provinces. Yellow alerts have been issued in the remaining 34 districts, including all three districts of Valley—Kathmandu, Lalitpur and Bhaktapur. \nThe Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved disbursement of US$41 million for Nepal on Tuesday.Concluding its fourth review under the four-year Extended Credit Facility (ECF), the international organisation allowed authorities to withdraw the equivalent of US$41.3 million, taking the total disbursement of financial support to Nepal under the programme to US$247.7 million.“Nepal has made good progress with the implementation of the programme, which has helped mitigate the impact of the pandemic and global shocks on economic activity, protect vulnerable groups, and preserve macroeconomic and financial stability,” the IMF said in a statement. According to the global financial agency, Nepal’s projected economic growth for fiscal 2023/24, which is around 3 percent, remains below potential in subdued domestic demand and post‑pandemic balance sheet repairs as the economy continues to face challenges.However, economic activity is expected to pick up with growth reaching 4.9 percent in FY2024/25, supported by stronger domestic demand.“The cautiously accommodative monetary policy stance, planned increase in capital expenditure in the FY2024/25 budget, additional hydropower generation, and a continued increase in tourist arrivals are expected to boost domestic demand and growth,” the statement further reads. Inflation is expected to remain within the Nepal Rastra Bank’s (NRB) target ceiling of 5.5 percent.The IMF has also warned that a failure to raise the execution rate of capital projects would deprive the economy of much-needed stimulus and weigh on growth as ‘domestic risks dominate the outlook.’Despite the country’s cautiously accommodative monetary policy, fragile political stability could disrupt policy continuity and reform implementation. “Intensification of financial sector vulnerabilities such as a further rise in non-performing loans (NPL) or more failures of cooperative lenders could endanger banking system soundness,” the agency said, adding that “high commodity prices could slow the recovery in energy-intensive sectors.”“As monetary policy transmission is still weak in a context of balance sheet repair, a cautious and data dependent monetary policy remains appropriate to preserve price and external stability,” said Bo Li, deputy managing director and acting chair of the IMF’s executive board.“Continuing to strengthen Nepal’s financial system remains a top priority. Financial policy should remain vigilant and focused on building regulatory frameworks that promote sustainable credit growth while proactively addressing emerging vulnerabilities in the savings and credit cooperatives sector.”Li added that a cautious and data dependent monetary policy remains appropriate to preserve price and external stability as monetary policy transmission is still weak in a context of balance sheet repair.“Continued progress on the structural front—improving the business climate, building human capital, and continuing to improve social safety nets—remains needed to foster investment and more inclusive growth,” he added.Li suggested that Nepal should also emphasise the full execution of the child grant budget, followed by an expansion of the program to all districts in Nepal.  \nChinese imports into Nepal surged 34.8% due to increased EV demand, while Indian imports declined 3.1% amid export restrictions, indicating a shift in Nepal's trade towards China despite India's dominant share.\nThe National Human Rights Commission calls for inclusion of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and justice for former Maoist child soldiers in the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry Act.\nIn 1980s, Nepal's communist leader Mohan Bikram Singh founded CPN (CPN-Maoist), led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who navigated a violent conflict for a more inclusive Nepal despite political setbacks and personal insecurities, but now faces an impending downfall due to his unreliability as a coalition partner and a flawed electoral system.\nNepal's electric vehicle (EV) imports have surged, with China accounting for two-thirds of imports and outpacing conventional vehicle imports due to increased consumer adoption, government incentives, and easy financing.\nDespite a budget claim that all districts are connected to the national road network, Humla district remains isolated due to the lack of a bridge over the Karnali river, resulting in increased transportation costs and hardships for residents.\nKey events unfold as characters confront adversity, make choices, and navigate the consequences of their actions, ultimately shaping their destinies.\n\nSri Lanka, featuring ancient irrigation systems, faced financial crisis in 2022, but tourism is now revitalizing the island nation after a recent Post travel journey covering 70% of its territory.\nEducation in Every Home’s report titled ‘Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in Nepal’s Textbooks’ highlights the lack of diversity, inclusivity, and inaccuracies in these textbooks.  The findings include egregious mistakes in textbooks like the inclusion of a letter Abraham Lincloln supposedly wrote—dating to a time 17 years after his assassination, to assertions like Brazil has tigers, elephants and rhinos while Germany has tigers and monkeys. The books display a clear bias in favour of Brahmin Chhetri males, while women make up just 18 percent of all people profiled. While 80 percent of all bylines are male, the presence of marginalised communities, especially Dalits, is nearly non-existent.  \nDia Yonzon (she/her) is a writer and researcher. She runs The Melung Stories, a platform dedicated to amplifying the literary and artistic expressions of queer and indigenous communities. Yonzon is also affiliated with the Writing Center at the Open Institute of Social Science.In this conversation with the Post’s Rishika Dhakal, Yonzon talks about queer literature, her work at UN Women Nepal, and the books that have influenced her.How has your background in law and arts influenced your approach to advocacy and activism at UN Women Nepal?I worked at the UN Women Nepal for three years. My background in law had a direct influence on my work. However, I never wanted to become a practising lawyer; I just wanted to understand the philosophy of law. While studying law, I gravitated towards the field of human rights.Currently, I am involved in creating art and literature. I realised that when we need to say something in society, more than logistics and data, what touches people’s hearts is art. It is because art shapes us in subtle ways, knowingly or unknowingly.Reading feminist literature has also shaped my activism. So, everything I do has been shaped by the books I read. For example, many people dismiss ‘Pride and Prejudice’ as cheap literature. But once you read the book, you will find that Jane Austen provided satirical commentary on the era in which she was born.Even today, we tend to dismiss literature. Art and literature provide a subtle glimpse of the contemporary world.The first book that made a significant impact on you and why?I mostly write about how time and space affect love. As a child, I remember reading ‘The Time Traveller’s Wife’, the first book I purchased with pocket money.And now that I think about it, the book significantly influenced me because I am a sucker for romance. The story centres on a timeless love that transcends specific moments and places. This one component resonated with me.But as my writing grew, I realised it didn’t necessarily have to be about sci-fi. I write about general things, such as how people express love. I developed that by reading ‘The Time Traveller’s Wife’.In your experience, how important is queer literature for the representation and empowerment of queer individuals?While growing up, I didn’t see much mainstream literature that had queer representation. This made me feel like I was some sort of outcast. And it wasn’t just me who felt this way; others did, too. You want to feel you are being represented. During my childhood, there was only one mainstream memoir about a gay person that I remember. Nepali literature should be more diverse. As it will allow young people from such communities to feel like they are being represented. The greater the presence of queer literature, the more normalised it will become.Currently, the representation of queer people is disheartening, often depicting their lives as solely filled with suffering. By discussing the various dimensions of queer life, including joy and sadness, we can normalise these experiences. This helps non-queer allies to relate and understand better.One of my major concerns is that we only have access to popular media, which limits our understanding of contemporary society in the past. For queer people, this is especially troubling because there are no reference points to learn about their experiences and situations back then.Decades ago, queerness was vilified. Films like ‘Chandigarh Kare Aashiqui’, reflect minor narrative shifts in our society, even if they are misguided portrayals of the experiences of queer people.Compared to the past, many people today are discussing queerness, indicating a significant societal shift. This is why it is crucial to write more queer stories now. From a documentary and archival perspective, these stories will be invaluable for understanding the experiences of queer people in the future.As someone who is into fiction, how do you think it can contribute to understanding social issues?Fiction reflects contemporary society and its conversations, ultimately allowing us to address various prevalent issues. In fiction, if you’re a man reading a novel with a female protagonist, you can immerse yourself in the protagonist’s experience. Because fiction is a story, it isn’t necessarily preachy. It doesn’t order people to do this or that. Instead, it builds a world and invites people to explore it. No subject is one-dimensional, so it allows you to explore everything. Speculative fiction lets us see what might happen if we continue on a certain path.By capturing all the small nuances of society in the story, we can amplify and highlight issues that have not received the attention they deserve.What books would you recommend to non-queer allies who want to better understand and support queer communities?Many smaller publications help in aiding one's understanding of queerness. Recently, we conducted a 10-day residency titled ‘A Room of One’s Own’. The UN, Katha Satha, and the Open Institute supported the residency. At the end of it, we published a book of the same title. One can follow magazines like ‘Queerbad’ by the Queer Muslim Project (TQMP), which features stories written by queer writers from South Asia. Similarly, the ‘A Room of One’s Own: Queer Writer’s Residency’ publication can also be followed. Additionally, small independent zines such as ‘A Song of Revolution’ from Nepal should be considered.For more accessible reads, I recommend Niranjan Kunwar’s ‘Between Queens and the Cities’ and ‘Beyond the Gender Binary’ by Alok Vaid-Menon. Ocean Vuong's ‘On Earth, We’re Briefly Gorgeous’ is also an excellent work of fiction that provides insight into queer experiences.Can you share about the Melung stories writing workshop? How do these workshops contribute to the queer and indigenous literary community?Melung Stories is a storytelling platform. They document and archive stories of queer people. Writing is not seen as a lucrative job. Even if one chooses to be a writer, they need a community. The community I speak of includes editors, readers, and publishers who will support you. Plus, there is no certainty that it will pay you. In that context, many people who belong to indigenous or marginalised communities avoid writing and instead take up stable jobs that pay well. So, who ends up writing? Folks who already have resources, have generational wealth or can make time for themselves. In our workshop, we target queer and indigenous people. We want to give them resources, time, space, guidance, and a certain agency. There are lots of people who want to share their stories but don’t have the time or the space to do so. So, in Melung stories, we give them time and space. And their stories get recorded. How do you envision the future of queer literature and representation in Nepal?When discussing art and literature, we assume they are void of societal issues. This is because the language we use to discuss them is sophisticated. However, art and literature are not created in a vacuum. They feed off of society and reflect the society we live in. Nepal and South Asia need more diverse voices to tell authentic and meaningful queer stories. Queer literature shouldn’t be limited to biographies and memoirs; it can include fiction, biography, or sci-fi to reach a broader audience. Queer books shouldn’t be treated as rare treasures but should be made widely accessible.Diya Yonzon’s book recommendationsThe God of Small ThingsAuthor: Arundhati RoyPublisher: Random HouseYear: 1997The book tells the story of two fraternal twins.

GB Rai, who is at large, is believed to have fled the country.In its terms of reference (ToR), the committee has divided the cooperatives it has to investigate into two categories. It has listed the 20 cooperatives declared problematic ones by the government’s Crisis-ridden Cooperatives Management Committee in its schedule 1 and nine others including those linked to the Gorkha Media Network in the schedule 2.The committee had planned to first listen to the victims who deposited money in the cooperatives listed in the schedule 1 and then move on to schedule 2.After listening to the cooperative victims’ grievances on Wednesday, the committee members decided to hold discussions on the cooperatives listed in the schedule 2.“Soon, the parliamentary special probe committee will start discussion on the fourth point [that mentions the schedule 2],” Lekh Nath Dahal, a member of the parliamentary special probe committee, told the Post.As per the ToR, the probe panel will conduct a study and make recommendations on resolving legal and institutional issues faced by cooperatives and on regulations, supervision, and transparency of their financial systems.Coordinators of various struggle committees formed by cooperative victims were also present during the discussion. Chair of the parliamentary probe panel, Surya Thapa, a lawmaker from CPN-UML, said that they invited the representatives to listen to their grievances as the victims’ suggestions would be crucial in reaching a conclusion on the matter.Speaking in a discussion with the House committee, Shaligram Duwadi, a victim of Sahara Multi-Purpose Cooperatives from Chitwan, said that Rs510 million was rerouted from the cooperative to the Gorkha Media Network.“We tried to lodge the complaint against Gorkha Media Network with Chitwan Police but they refused to register our complaint after they saw the name of Gorkha Media Network,” Duwadi was quoted as saying by a member of the special probe committee. “Why was the case not registered by Chitwan Police?”Likewise, the committee member said Krishna Pariyar, a cooperative victim of Swarnalaxmi Saving and Credit Cooperative of Kathmandu, also accused Home Minister Lamichhane of abusing state power by not letting him withdraw his money and cash his cheque.“Though the victims of many cooperatives were present in the meeting today [Wednesday], the discussion was more focused on the chairman and managing director of Gorkha Media Network,” said the committee member.According to the committee member, the victims stressed that no matter how powerful these two people [Rai and Lamichhane] are, they should be booked under the law.The parliamentary special probe committee invited representatives from 29 cooperatives mentioned in the ToR but most of those present at the meeting were victims from the cooperatives linked to the media company, according to committee members.“Though victims from other cooperatives were also present at the committee meeting, most of them were those whose money was embezzled by the Gorkha Media Network,” Ishwari Devi Neupane, a probe committee member representing Nepali Congress, told the Post. Listed under schedule 2 of the ToR or linked to the media company are: the Ideal Yamuna Multipurpose Cooperative, the Image Saving and Credit Cooperative, the Sahara Saving and Cooperative, the Samanata Saving and Credit Cooperative, the Sano Paila Saving and Credit Cooperative, the Supreme Saving and Credit Cooperative, the Suryadarshan Saving and Credit Cooperative, the Sumeru Saving and Credit Cooperative and the Swarnalaxmi Saving and Credit Cooperative.Reportedly, money from Butwal-based Supreme Saving and Credit Cooperative, Suryadarshan Saving and Credit and Cooperative of Pokhara, Sahara Saving and Cooperative of Chitwan, Swarnalaxmi Saving and Credit Cooperative of Kathmandu, Sano Paila Saving and Credit Cooperative of Birgunj, and Nepalgunj’s Samantha Saving and Credit Cooperative has been rerouted to the Gorkha Media Network.Before this, the committee held discussions with top government officials including Secretary of the Ministry of Home Affairs Ek Narayan Aryal and Inspector General of Police (IGP) Basanta Bahadur Kunwar, among other officials, on July 4 to discuss the cooperatives under investigation.On the same day, Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) Chief Shyam Gyawali and Crime Investigation Department Chief Tek Bahadur Tamang were also called for the discussion.As per a probe committee member, some committee members grilled IGP Kunwar about his previous statement in the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee. Speaking at the parliamentary committee in the last week of March, the Nepal Police chief had claimed that police had found no evidence of Home Minister Lamichhane’s involvement in cooperative fraud.“When I made the statement in the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee about the home minister, his involvement in the scam had not been disclosed,” a committee member quoted IGP Kunwar as saying at the special committee meeting. Another member of the probe committee, Shishir Khanal, said the IGP said he was not under any pressure to give a statement about Home Minister Lamichhane. Khanal is a lawmaker from the Lamichhane-led Rastriya Swatantra Party.“The IGP said that he spoke on the basis of facts and that no information regarding Home Minister Lamichhane’s involvement in the cooperatives scam had been found till the day he made the statement.”Also, the committee held discussions with chiefs and representatives of various panels formed since 1990 to probe irregularities in the cooperative sector.The parliamentary special panel will make recommendations on safeguarding depositors’ savings, and quick and easy refunds for victims whose deposits have been embezzled.The panel also agreed to probe crisis-ridden cooperatives and fast-track the refund process for the depositors of the cooperatives concerned.The parliamentary special probe committee began its work a month ago after a month-long discussion with top officials from government agencies as well as chiefs and members of various panels formed so far by the government to look into problems involving cooperatives. \nPrime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal has said that CPN-UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli had hatched a conspiracy against him and the government and joined hands with the Nepali Congress to form a new coalition by dismantling the UML-Maoist Centre alliance prematurely.The four-month-long partnership between Dahal and Oli collapsed after the UML chief sealed a yet-to-be-disclosed seven-point agreement with Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba on the midnight of July 2. Speaking at a meeting of the Maoist Centre’s parliamentary committee on Wednesday, the embattled prime minister accused Oli of betraying him. After the UML recalled its ministers from the Dahal Cabinet and withdrew its support to the government, Dahal is seeking the vote of confidence in the House of Representatives on Friday.“Oli betrayed me for no reason,” said Dahal. “We came to know that the Nepali Congress and the UML were inching towards a political deal but Oli lied to me several times about it.”On the morning of July 2, Dahal and Oli had a three-hour-long conversation at his residence in Baluwatar but Oli did not tell him the truth about what he had agreed with Deuba. “If you are going to become the prime minister with the support of Nepali Congress, I will quit and help you,” Dahal shared with the party’s lawmakers about what he had told Oli. But Oli had flatly denied having reached an agreement with the Congress, according to Maoist leaders.Hitraj Pandey, the chief whip of the Maoist Centre, quoted Dahal as saying that Oli did not want to inform him about the deal with Deuba. According to Congress and UML leaders, Deuba, Oli and second rank leaders of both parties had met regularly for months ahead of the July 2 deal.After second-rank leaders worked out the fundamentals of the new political deal and power-sharing, Deuba and Oli gave it a final touch at midnight on July 2 at the residence of a businessman.Dahal and Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Rabi Lamichhane have been claiming that after the arrest of Bechan Jha in the fake Bhutanese refugee case, Deuba and Oli joined forces in order to protect some of their close aides and family members. According to Nepal Police officials, Jha, who claimed to be an influential power broker, had established good connections with top Congress and UML leaders. Citing their initial findings of interrogation with other suspects they had arrested, police said individuals had given millions of rupees to Jha to facilitate their travel to the United States on the guise of Bhutanese refugees. Some of the accused who masterminded the fake Bhutanese refugee scam are in police custody. Jha’s arrest made the Congress and UML leaders fearful of being arrested, said the Maoist and Swatantra Party leaders. Briefing his party’s lawmakers, Dahal said that he then telephoned Deuba to know what exactly had happened between them. Deuba’s reply was that he and Oli had already reached a deal. He reportedly turned down Dahal's offer to lead the government, according to Pandey.But UML leaders, including their general secretary Shankar Pokhrel, Deputy General Secretary Pradeep Gyawali and others, claimed that after Dahal returned from New Delhi, he started negotiations for new government formation with Deuba and offered him the leadership of a national government.“After we came to know that the prime minister was hatching a conspiracy and going to destabilise the country's politics by changing the ruling partners, we decided to initiate talks with the Congress for the sake of forming a stable government, giving people hope and amending some constitutional provisions,” UMl leaders said. Dahal returned from New Delhi on June 10 after attending the swearing-in ceremony of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Dahal is seeking a vote of confidence on Friday. On Wednesday, the Nagarik Unmukti Party also decided to withdraw the support extended to the Dahal government. The government has already been reduced to a minority after the UML pulled the plug on it last week.“We will talk to all political parties and seek their support,” said Pandey, the Maoist Centre chief whip. The prime minister will mull his resignation only after the vote of trust in the House, said Pandey. Dahal, who was elected prime minister as per Article 76 (2) of the constitution, claims that the next government will be formed as per Article 76 (3) of the constitution. If the President upholds the spirit of the constitution, he should call for new government formation as per Article 76 (3), Pandey said. \nFormer prime minister and CPN-UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli, who is set to become prime minister next week, defended his seven-point deal with Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba. However, Oli said that the intricacies of constitutional amendments, which the two largest parties have reportedly agreed to in principle, have yet to be finalised.Speaking at a meeting of the party’s secretariat on Wednesday, Oli said that the two parties have agreed to the need to amend the constitution to protect national interests, make Nepal prosperous and the Nepalis happy, but the details have not been worked out.Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is set to go for a floor test on Friday after the UML and some other coalition partners withdrew their support to the government. As per the agreement reached between Deuba and Oli on July 2, the UML chair will become the prime minister early next week.Giving reasons why the first and second largest parties in the House of Representatives had come together for government formation, Oli stated that the current tendencies to allow private and partisan interests to dominate state affairs, and fringe parties with few lawmakers claiming the post of chief minister and their unusual manoeuvrings needed to be defeated by the partnership of the two parties.Deuba has already endorsed Oli as the next prime minister. The two parties will have a more or less equal number of Cabinet ministers, though they have yet to enter into the power-sharing deal.“Some are trying to create an illusion about the agreements signed between the Nepali Congress and the UML. Some were trying to pay their lip service to amending the constitution, but they actually engaged in making the constitution a failure. In due course of time some constitutional provisions should be revisited, so we have stressed the need for amendments,” said Oli.After the meeting, UML deputy general secretary Pradeep Gyawali said the statements made by Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane were not true. After the government decided to open more cases of corruption targeting top leaders of the Congress and the UML, the two parties came together overnight to topple the government, Dahal and Lamichhane have said publicly.But that is merely a political stunt, said Gyawali. Who stopped them from opening corruption cases in the last four months?“Prachanda ji had been in the government for 10 months [until he pushed the Congress out of the coalition], but what stopped him from opening the corruption cases? Rabi ji became the minister for six months over two terms. What stopped him from investigating the cases?” Gyawali asked. “These are only stunts. After failing to run the country and the government [effectively], they need some excuse which they are making. They kept saying this in the past week.”There is a large section, including the CPN (Maoist Centre) and others, that has critically taken the issue of charter amendment. But we have not discussed which constitutional provisions will go for the changes, he said. Those constitutional reforms will be based on the experience of a decade. The constitution was promulgated in September 2015. The agreement between the Congress and UML to amend it has made the political fraternity and activists and observers curious.No agreement has been reached on who will lead the commission that will suggest amending and reforming the constitutional provisions, he added.“Some are trying to create an illusion after the Nepali Congress and the UML came up with a deal. They are also saying that the agreement has taken the constitution towards anarchy, political instability and confusion. We see the governments in provinces are changing frequently or every month. Private and partisan interests dominated, instability and bargaining were rampant, and parties frequently changed the camps,” Oli shared his observation. “Development activities, necessities and requirements of the people had never been at the centre, but corruption and instability were dominated and rampant. So, how can we stop such a tendency? That is why we, the Nepali Congress and the UML, came together,” said Oli.Any attempt to fail the constitution, and weaken federalism is not accepted, he said the constitution is the dynamic document; it should guide society so the constitution should be amended as per the context of the time. Oli is all set to become the prime minister by early next week, but the Nepali Congress and UML have not settled the power-sharing deal, including the division of the ministerial portfolio, according to Oli.Oli said the power-sharing deal will be concrete only after the new government takes shape. “We will try to bring more parties into the government. We are in discussion with them. In general, the allocation of the ministries will be made as per the strength of the political party,” he added.The division of ministerial portfolios will be decided only after Friday or after Prime Minister Dahal fails to get the vote of confidence in the House of Representatives.The UML has issued a whip to all its lawmakers to vote against Dahal on Friday.Oli told the party meeting that smaller parties are also likely to join his government, according to one UML leader. There was a general understanding between the Congress and the UML of dividing 19 ministries between them.From the UML, Bishnu Poudel will be in the government as the finance minister. But there is no decision in the Congress on who will lead the party’s ministers in the Oli cabinet. It could be the party general secretary Gagan Thapa or one among senior leaders like Krishna Prasad Sitaula and Prakash Man Singh. Deuba wants Ramesh Lekhak to serve as the home minister, a leader close to the party president said.Oli is in a mood to form a governing team of both experienced and new faces, UML leaders said. Choosing ministers is more difficult for Deuba due to multiple power centres in the party led by Thapa, Sitaula, Singh and Shekhar Koirala. There is also the need to balance gender, region, and ethnic clusters in the party’s picks.The Congress has already endorsed the two-party deal. Oli is tipped to lead a ‘national consensus government’ for a year and a half, before handing the reins over to Deuba who will lead the administration until the general elections in 2027.Deuba and Oli have also agreed to review the electoral system, proportional representation, the composition of the National Assembly, and the size of provincial assemblies. The Congress and the UML will lead three provincial governments each, leaving the provincial government in Madhesh that is led by CK Raut’s Janamat Party. \nA new ‘political deal’ sealed between Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba and Chairman of the CPN-UML KP Oli at midnight on July 2 at the residence of a businessperson has been kept secret, sparking curiosity about its content and authenticity.While leaders of the Nepali Congress and the UML have disclosed most details of the deal, the original document has yet to be released, which has raised questions.Other parties in the House of Representatives have also shown an interest in seeing the original document.But the Congress and UML leaders have said that there is no reason to hide or keep secret the deal signed by the two party leaders, but the signatories may be looking for an appropriate time.“I don’t see any technical reason to keep the deal under wraps,” said Pradeep Gyawali, deputy secretary general of the UML. “Various stakeholders may be curious about it, but it will eventually be disclosed, at the right time.” Oli had informed his party leaders at a meeting that he had struck a seven-point deal with Deuba. “Most of the content of the deal is already out. There is nothing new to add,” said Gyawali. UML General Secretary Shankar Pokhrel and Congress leaders Ramesh Lekhak, Arzu Rana and Gyanendra Bahadur Karki were involved in finalising the agreement.Lawmakers from the CPN (Maoist Centre) and the Rastriya Swatantra Party, among others, have been demanding a copy of the deal and urging the Congress and the UML to produce it in Parliament as the deal involves serious issues like amending the constitution. But the leaders of the two parties have remained silent, again asserting that the deal will be disclosed at an appropriate time.On Saturday, a parliamentary party meeting of the Nepali Congress gave some clues of the said deal between Deuba and Oli.The meeting affirmed that a new national government will be formed in accordance with Article 76 (2) of the constitution as per the spirit of the agreement reached between the two largest parties last Monday. The meeting also endorsed the deal.As per the understanding between the Congress and the UML, Oli will lead a new ‘national consensus government’ for a year and a half. For the remaining term, Deuba will be the prime minister.Deuba and Oli also agreed on power-sharing and proposed constitutional amendments including a review of the electoral system, proportional representation, changes to the composition of the National Assembly, and discussion on the size of provincial assemblies.Min Bishwakarma, head of the Nepali Congress publicity department, said the seven-point deal will be made public in the House of Representatives and he called for the formation of a new government based on the national consensus.Before the formation of a new government under Oli’s leadership, incumbent Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who has already lost the majority support and now serves in a caretaker capacity, will face a floor test on Friday.He will certainly fail to get the majority vote, paving the way for President Ram Chandra Poudel to start the process for the formation of a new government.In the 275-strong House of Representatives, Dahal needs the support of 138 lawmakers to win the trust vote, but he currently has the backing of only 73 lawmakers—32 from the CPN (Maoist Centre), 21 from the Rastriya Swatantra Party and 10 from the CPN (Unified Socialist). The Janamat Party, with six members, and the Nagarik Unmukti Party, with four lawmakers, also support him.As per an initial power-sharing deal, the Congress will lead 10 ministries, including home, and the UML nine, including finance. Likewise, the Congress and the UML will lead three provincial governments each, with the government in Madhesh to be led by the CK Raut-led Janamat Party.The deal will be tabled in the House of Representatives, said Ram Hari Khatiwada, a Nepali Congress lawmaker. \nMukul Dhakal, the Rastriya Swatantra Party general secretary and its spokesperson, had voiced his fears before he submitted a review report to party president Rabi Lamichhane. “I could be removed from the party positions once I submitted the review report to the party chair,” Dhakal had said on June 26.Even before Dhakal handed in the review report, which he had prepared after visiting 38 districts in the wake of the April by-elections, its major findings were already out in the media. This hadn’t sat well with the party’s top brass and Dhakal’s prophecy came true within two weeks. On Tuesday, the party’s central committee relieved Dhakal of all his party duties. Dhakal is the party’s founding general secretary, spokesperson, and central committee member.“The party’s central committee meeting has taken the decision to expel Dhakal from all official posts,” Manish Jha, the party’s acting spokesperson, told the Post. “In view of his contribution to the party since its establishment, the central committee has decided to relieve him of his official positions only. He will continue to be a party member.”Jha said the move comes after the party’s disciplinary commission sought action against Dhakal a week ago, accusing him of incompetence and indiscipline, indecent and chaotic conduct, and violating party rules.“He is not being punished for what he wrote in the field report, but for his misconduct,” Jha added.Soon after the RSP expelled him from party positions, Dhakal took to social media and said he was expelled from the “Rabi Lamichhane club,” but “the bell will not stop ringing” within the party.Bell is the election symbol of the RSP, which now has 21 seats in the House of Representatives. For a party formed just a few months before the November 2022 election, the RSP became the fourth largest in the House, surprising analysts, who said that the party had ridden the back of its leader Lamichhane’s flamboyant personality and anti-establishment politics. The party later joined a coalition government, thereby assimilating with the very forces that it rose to power criticising.“The determination to turn Rabi Lamichhane’s party into the Rastriya Swatantra Party won’t be stopped, the bell won’t stop ringing,” Dhakal wrote, referring to the party chair’s cult of personality.Dhakal was suspended from the position of general secretary and party spokesperson for a week on July 3 over the same concerns.Soon after the RSP faced a sobering loss in the Ilam by-election in April this year, the party’s secretariat meeting on May 3 decided to conduct a cross-country review tour under a Dhakal-led team.Dhakal commenced the journey on May 19 with the objective of identifying the party’s strengths and weaknesses in relation to its policies, decisions, and organisational structure.In his political document, prepared after a review tour of 38 districts, Dhakal claimed that the party was headed for a disaster if it did not rectify its mistake.The review report also criticised the arbitrary nature of the party’s operations, President Lamichhane, and urged making the party bigger than one that, critics say, is built around a single leader’s image, among other things.On July 3, the party’s central committee discussed Dhakal’s review report. While Dhakal demanded that the meeting be broadcast live on social media, the members unanimously rejected the idea, leaving Dhakal further miffed.Moreover, that same day, Dhakal publicly criticised Lamichhane in a social media post after the party chief did not allow him to present the proposal he prepared based on the review tour at the meeting.“During the party secretariat meeting yesterday [July 3], I was told to submit a proposal based on the review report,” Dhakal then said. “I had prepared the written proposal but the party president did not allow me to submit it today.”He had also said he was promised that he would be allowed to share his thoughts during the central committee meeting. “But the party president did not allow me to do so either,” Dhakal said.The central committee meeting termed the review report prepared by Dhakal an incomplete document.Meanwhile, Dhakal had accused party chief Lamichhane of always trying to shirk his responsibility, whatever position he held, before the party officially decided to suspend him from his party position on the demand of the disciplinary commission.Dhakal had said that when Lamichhane was the managing director of the Gorkha Media Network, he shifted the blame for all wrongdoings to Chairman GB Rai of the company that ran the now-shuttered Galaxy 4k television.“Now as the party chairman, he is blaming the general secretary for mistakes,” Dhakal had told journalists. “It seems his position never commits a mistake.”Jha, the acting spokesperson, said that while relieving Dhakal of his duties, the central committee considered all his wrongdoings against the party.“If he thinks that the central committee’s decision is incorrect, he has the right to complain about it in the party’s appeal committee,” Jha said.Meanwhile, in his social media post, Dhakal has vowed to talk about the issue further on Wednesday, after reiterating that “the bell will not stop ringing.” \nIn a bid to lessen the spread of the dengue virus during the ongoing monsoon season, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City has decided to continue the drive to destroy mosquito larvae and breeding grounds. Officials at the health department of the city office said on Friday that they have just completed a week-long drive in all 32 wards of the metropolis and plan to continue these efforts in the coming days as well.“Every Wednesday, our health volunteers will visit households and open spaces to destroy mosquito breeding grounds,” said Rishi Bhusal, epidemic prevention and control focal person at the metropolis. “Decisions on preventive measures including launching search and destroy drives will depend on the spread of virus and intensity of rainfall in the coming days.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vectors also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus, according to the World Health Organisation.According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,268 people from 72 districts have been infected with the dengue virus since January this year. Among the 72 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases: 141. Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and can be treated with paracetamol at home.Dengue symptoms include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes. Patients with these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and proper medical care can prevent death.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district. Since then, an increasing number of dengue infections have been reported from many districts, including major dengue outbreaks. Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Though the post-monsoon period is considered the dengue epidemic season, the deadly disease has already become endemic in Nepal, as outbreaks of the virus are reported every month, including in the winter months.Officials at the health department said that 654 health workers, including female community health volunteers, were deployed in the week-long campaign, which concluded on Friday.“Volunteers and health workers who were deployed to the door-to-door campaign checked the mosquito breeding grounds and the larvae, made people aware about the risks and destroyed the breeding grounds,” said Bhusal. Health workers reported that storage places for scrap materials, discarded cups, and plastic in open spaces, and unused lands as potential hotspots for the dengue virus in the coming days. Health workers have warned owners of these sites that action will be taken if mosquito larvae are found against the owner of the storage place if mosquito larvae were found.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects, such as plastic cups and bottles, could be breeding grounds for these mosquitoes.Public health experts say now is the right time to prepare for and prevent possible outbreaks. Health ministry officials said they have alerted all related agencies to the risk of a dengue outbreak. \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City has imparted mental health screening training to doctors and paramedics serving at urban health promotion centres.Officials at the Health Department in the metropolis hope that the move will help hundreds of patients with mental health issues in the city to get timely treatment.“Getting free treatment for mental health problems comes under the right to get free basic health care services,” said Sajina Maharjan, acting head of the department. “Mental health problem screening training to doctors and paramedics will help in the timely diagnosis of the problems and start of early treatment.”At least 32 doctors serving at the urban health promotion centres under the city office and dozens of paramedics participated in five-day screening training. The metropolis has upgraded its urban health clinics to urban health promotion centres and started providing services through medical doctors. “Due to the lack of doctors at our urban health promotion centres, patients suffering from mental health problems have been deprived of timely treatment,” said Nali Bajracharya, a senior public health officer at the department. “Now patients having mental health issues and seeking care at our health centres will also get mental health treatment.”Though neither the federal government agency nor the city office has data on the number of people suffering from mental health problems in the metropolis, doctors estimated that a lot of people could be suffering from various forms of mental health problems—anxiety, depression and others.Officials say that they are also planning to provide free medication to patients with mental health problems.Health workers say that many city dwellers, despite having mental health problems, do not seek treatment and instead turn to drugs and substances to cope. Due to the entrenched social stigma, fear of discrimination and other factors, many patients in Nepal do not talk about their mental health issues.The general tendency among people to conceal mental health issues due to the stigma attached to it has also forced patients to opt for substance abuse, doctors say.They say that while drugs and alcohol may provide temporary relief from stress, they are not a solution and can adversely affect mental health and well-being in the long run.“Treatment in the initial stage of mental illness helps patients achieve better results. For that, early diagnosis is crucial,” said Dr Pomawati Thapa, chief of the Non-communicable Disease and Mental Health Section at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Other local units should also follow the initiative to provide mental health screening training to health workers, including doctors.”Nepal is among the countries with highest rates of suicide, which is an extreme manifestation of a mental health problem.According to Nepal Police data, 6,993 people took their own lives in the fiscal year 2022-2023. This accounts for more than 19 deaths on average daily. Fifty-six percent of those who die by suicide are men.Doctors say that people do not attempt suicide for a single reason, but due to a complex situation arising from multiple problems.An increasing number of people are struggling with mental problems owing to the rising cost of living and the struggle to manage even their most basic needs, such as food, housing, healthcare and jobs, experts say.Whatever the cause, suicides and suicide attempts have a ripple effect, impacting families, friends, colleagues, communities and societies, doctors say.A study carried out by the Nepal Health Research Council in the past shows that about 13 percent of Nepalis suffer from some form of mental disorder. This means around one in eight Nepalis has mental health issues. Moreover, the country simply does not have enough experts to treat mental health problems, it added.Studies show the magnitude of suffering, the burden and costs for individuals, families and societies arising from mental health disorders are alarming in Nepal.“No doubt, mental health problems have been emerging as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in our country,” said Thapa. “All local governments must take initiative to address the problems. Only the federal government agencies cannot do much.”The World Health Organisation says that one in four people in the world has been affected by mental or neurological disorders at some point in their lives, and around 450 million people currently suffer from such conditions, placing mental disorders among the leading causes of ill health and disability worldwide. \nDuring the 2022 local level election, people of Kathmandu elected independent candidate Balendra Shah as their mayor for five years. Sunita Dangol of the CPN-UML secured the position of KMC deputy mayor in the same election. When they began their term, many suspected that the two—an independent mayor and his party-affiliated deputy—wouldn’t have cordial relations. But, in the last two years of their term, there has been no visible disagreement between them. They proved their sceptics wrong.Deputy Mayor Dangol kept mum when Mayor Shah accused her party chair, KP Sharma Oli, of policy corruption in the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate land scam.Moreover, Shah expressed his anger on June 3 over the government’s intervention in his plan to widen pavements in the New Road area. Deputy Prime Minister Raghubir Mahaseth of the UML leads the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, which maintains major roads.After the ministry intervened in the municipal plan to expand the sidewalk on New Road, Shah took to social media and wrote, “Honourable KP Oli jyu, don’t hoodwink people by engineering yet another scam to hide a scam of Rs10,000 crore [Rs100 billion].”He further added, “You have reassured those who had made advance payments to buy land of Giri Bandhu Tea Estate that they would get the land within two years.” “If one looks at the policy corruption in the tea estate, it appears not a single leaf would stir without Oli’s nod,” Shah wrote.A few days prior to the incident, Mayor Shah had engaged in a heated debate with Chinkaji Maharjan, a UML member and chairman of KMC’s ward 22, over the sidewalk expansion plan.Dangol remained quiet on the issue thus far. However, at the city council meeting on Monday, which also discussed KMC's policies and programmes for the fiscal year 2024-25, she criticised Mayor Shah for his remarks.“This should be the first time the deputy mayor opposed the public behavior and statement of the mayor,” a Kathmandu ward chairperson told the Post on the condition of anonymity.Dangol had her initial plan to contest the mayor position independently but the UML gave her the deputy mayor’s ticket.Speaking during the Monday discussion, Deputy Mayor Dangol said, addressing Mayor Shah, “Your and mine voices are being heard and watched by Nepalis worldwide. Therefore, those of us who want to come to politics should think about our expression,” Dangol remarked. “We should maintain the image and dignity of the institution we represent.”She also emphasised the need to accommodate the voices of everyone in an undertaking.Though the representatives of Kathmandu Metropolitan City claim that Dangol's Monday statement was unusual, they deny any rift between the two leaders of the local government. “City council’s is an internal meeting of the KMC where various issues arise. We settle those issues internally,” Nabin Manandhar, the KMC spokesperson and ward 17 chairman from the Nepali Congress, told the Post. “Having an opinion does not necessarily mean criticism.”Rajesh Kumar Shrestha, chair of KMC ward 19, seconded Manandhar.However, local representatives of Kathmandu have been questioning Shah for his ‘lone-wolf’ manner of leading the institution.“We should develop a working relationship that welcomes everyone’s spirit,” Dangol told the council meeting. “If one thinks they are in a position and everything should be done as they say, it will only lead to trouble.”She added, “While working in a team, we definitely have a different opinion, but different opinions should be respected.”At the meeting, referring to Mayor Shah's past statements, council member Anita Karki asked him, saying, “What if the voters of Kathmandu set ablaze the Durbar where the KMC office lies?”In September last year, when the traffic police obstructed a KMC vehicle, later known to be used by his postpartum wife, Mayor Shah provocatively wrote on Facebook, threatening to burn Singha Durbar, the federal government’s central secretariat.Traffic police, under the federal government, had stopped the vehicle to check necessary documents on a Saturday.After the incident, Shah wrote on social media warning that if the government blocked KMC's vehicles again, he would set fire to Singha Durbar.Dangol said on Monday that she believed it was wrong to write on social media or make a statement inciting people to burn the Singha Durbar or the Bagh Durbar, where the KMC office is situated.Dangol, speaking at the city council meeting, also said there should be no polarisation between the representatives who were elected to develop Kathmandu. \nA police officer was found dead on the premises of the federal parliament building in Baneshwar, Kathmandu on Wednesday.According to Ekram Giri, spokesperson for the federal parliament secretariat, Ajit Gole of Dolakha committed suicide by shooting himself.The body of the victim was recovered from the parliament building’s washroom.Dinesh Mainali, spokesperson for the Kathmandu Metro Police Range, said Gole, who was on duty from 6am to 10am, was found dead at around 8 in the morning. “A constable of Nepal Police was found dead inside a toilet of the parliament building,” Mainali told the Post. “Preliminary investigation shows he was inflicted with a gunshot.”Nepal police said the investigation is underway. \nPolice on Friday arrested two people from Thimi of Bhaktapur for allegedly mining cryptocurrency.The Central Investigation Bureau took 50-year-old Biswas Gurung and Rajendra Tahamata, 25, into custody in connection with the crime, said Hobindra Bogati, spokesperson for the bureau.The duo allegedly ran mining operations from the CTEVT’s information technology lab using a server and 64 desktops, on which blockchain applications were found during a preliminary investigation. Further investigation into the matter is underway. \nKot Ghar, once considered the seat of powerful Malla kings of Galkot, a pretty kingdom in the confederation of 24 states known as Chaubisi Rajya, has been restored and preserved to draw tourists.The Kot Ghar means a house where weapons are placed or stored. The town of Galkot once served as the fortress of the hilly kingdom ruled by the Mallas. The historical palace, which has been renovated, offers a reason to visit Galkot.Before the Panchayat era, Galkot served as Baglung's headquarters. Without the administrative offices, the locals seek to make Galkot the tourism headquarters of Baglung.According to history, Jitari Malla, the elder son of King Narayan Malla of Parbat, established Galkot Rajya in 1631 BS.A stone inscription states that Kot Ghar was constructed in 1661 BS. Galkot was free until Jagat Pratap Malla's rule in 1844 BS. The local government has been trying to preserve the historical artefacts to showcase to the visitors. The ancient palace of Galkot was in dire straits because of the lack of conservation.The Shreemeher Gana barracks of the Nepal Army and Galkot municipality have jointly renovated the almost-collapsed Kot Ghar.Professor Din Bahadur Thapa, a historian, said that the state also produced rice during the 10th generation of kings 213 years ago. After that, until 2015 BS, the kings of Galkot remained rulers. After the last king, Bharat Bam Malla, was elected to parliament in the 2015 BS general election, Raja Rajouta stepped down. There is a history of Bharat Bam submitting a proposal to remove Raja Rajauta from the House of Representatives.Thapa's research mentions that the state of Galkot extended to Kathekhola in the east, Pandavakhani in the west, Rum in Myagdi in the north, and Musikot in Gulmi in the south. After the kingdom was taken away, Jagat Pratap Bam Malla moved the palace to Shraddhakhet. The last king, Bharat Bam, built a palace in Harichor Bazar in 1990 BS. The construction started in 1978 BS.Even until 2019 BS, the central administrative units of Baglung were in Galkot. Later, they were shifted to Baglung Bazaar. The Kot Ghar conservation and tourism promotion programme was started five years ago to reflect this legacy. Bir Jung Bhandari, former ward chairman of Galkot Municipality, had started some of the works.Bharat Sharma Gaire, mayor of the municipality, said that the historic city planning and the work to preserve the history had been completed with the help of the Nepal Army.Cannoning infrastructure has also been built at Sahasradhara waterfall near Kot Ghar. Festivals are organised during the Dashain and Chaite Dashain. Hundreds of pilgrims tour these religious sites annually.Locals conduct regular worship. A hundred houses in Kotmaidan village offer worship by taking ownership. It is listed in the city pride project.The weapons in Kot Ghar have been kept separately by making a new home. The doors and windows of Kot Ghar have been modelled on the Bhaktapur craft. On the way to Kot Ghar, a barbed wire fence and railing have been set up.Drainage and culverts have been constructed in some road stretches that reach Kot Ghar from the mid-hill highway. The municipality has been investing yearly to pave the road to Kot Ghar. The location is important from the tourism perspective.Galkot Valley, Ghumte hill, Daram River, and Tara River can be viewed from Kot Ghar. Kalika temple, near Kot Ghar, has also been maintained.Nearly 100 ropanies have been protected through barbed wire fences. The number of tourists visiting Kot Ghar has recently increased with the construction of drinking water taps and resting areas.The association of the former army conducted a district-level annual general meeting in the Kot Ghar area.It is presumed that the state was named Galkot, derived from ‘Golo Kot’, the way the Kot Ghar was built.Kot Ghar, located in Galkot Municipality-3, was the first seat of the kings. Though the king shifted to Harichaur through Shraddakhet, the weapons were kept in Kot Ghar and Kalika temple. Other structures were also built around Kot Ghar. Gaire said the places of historical importance were protected. A six-kilometre road has been built from the mid-hill highway to Kot Ghar.The road to Kot Ghar from the highway was maintained and paved, said Pham Bahadur Khatri, the ward chairman. He said that around Rs1.5 million was spent to renovate Kot Ghar, and the Nepal Army provided Rs900,000 and the human resources. \nThe government last week raised the minimum support price for paddy by more than 6.5 percent for the harvest of the next fiscal year, 2023-24, soon after the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led administration was reduced to a minority.This was the second time the government fixed the minimum support price during the paddy transplantation period. The Ministry of Commerce and Supplies tabled the proposal to increase the price, which was approved by the Cabinet meeting on July 4.The government decided to increase the minimum support price of common paddy to Rs3,580.62 per quintal (Rs35.80 per kg), up 6.50 percent. Similarly, the floor price for ‘mota dhan’ has been increased to Rs3,410.51 per quintal (Rs34.10 per kg), up 6.64 percent.The minimum support price is the lowest legal price that farmers receive for their harvests. The government does not fix the floor price of fine paddy.A minimum support price is an intervention by the government to protect farmers against sudden slumps in market prices. It is the rate at which the government buys farm produce when no other buyers are in the market.Usually, it is announced in time for farmers to make their production plans before the beginning of the planting season. Under the scheme, the government has to buy a certain amount of the total paddy harvest.In 2012, the government announced the resumption of the policy of fixing the minimum price following complaints that middlemen had been determining the market rate.Until 1999, the minimum support price for paddy and wheat would be announced regularly.According to reports, the practice was fully abandoned that year after the government launched the 20-year Agriculture Perspective Plan.Even when the minimum support price was announced, it was irrelevant as it was set well below the projected market price to protect the government from having to buy farm products should prices tumble.Moreover, reports said that even when support prices were announced, it was not done in time.The policy was irregular.In 2016-17, the minimum support price was announced in mid-November. In 2017-2018, the Cabinet sent back the supplies ministry's proposal. In 2021-22, the government announced the minimum support price for paddy on November 3, which is harvest time. The price was raised by 8 percent.On different occasions, members of parliamentary committees have criticised the government policy as ‘absurd’ because it was announced after many farmers had already harvested and sold their crops. Lawmakers said that the minimum support price was supposed to encourage farmers to boost output, but the government-fixed floor price had ‘discouraged’ them instead.It was only since the last fiscal year that the government announced the price before the transplantation season started.Paddy is transplanted in June and harvested by the end of October.This year, as of Sunday, paddy transplantation has been completed on 539,766 hectares as of Sunday, which is 38.6 percent of Nepal's 1.39 million hectares of paddy fields.Tilak Raj Chaulagain, a senior agro economist at the Department of Agriculture, said that the paddy transplantation rate was slightly lower (by 4 percent) compared to the same period last year. This year, the monsoon entered Nepal from the east on June 10, three days ahead of its usual onset date, according to the Meteorological Forecasting Division.Chaulagain said that the monsoon arrived on time, but it took time to be active. “As a result, transplantation was delayed slightly in the hills, but this will not affect production or productivity.\"According to Chaulagain, while transplantation on the hills is nearing completion, it will pick up pace in Tarai from mid-July. The Tarai, the largest paddy-producing region in the country, accounts for 71 percent of the total rice acreage. The hills account for 25 percent, and the mountain region for 4 percent.“Since there are no reports of a shortage of chemical fertilisers this year, we expect transplantation to be completed within a month and a half at this pace,” said Chaulagain.According to the department, Madhesh has the lowest translation rate of all provinces. In Madhesh province, which commands the lion’s share of the paddy fields, transplantation has been completed on 97,851 hectares, which is 25.5 percent of the 383,150 hectares available paddy fields in the province. Nepal’s economic well-being is closely tied to the rainy season. Rainwater is the lifeblood of Nepal's Rs5.70 trillion economy, which relies heavily on agriculture, with nearly two-thirds of the farmlands being rain-fed.During the four months of June to September, a large part of the country receives nearly 80 percent of its annual rainfall.The production of food grain, mainly rice, depends on the amount and distribution of monsoon rainfall over the country. The monsoon rains also replenish groundwater and reservoirs critical for drinking and power generation. \nIn a bid to support midwives and other healthcare personnel in ensuring safer births in low-resource settings, the Ministry of Health and Population has launched a “safe delivery app”.Officials hope that the mobile application will complement and enhance the ongoing capacity-building of health workers and help in reducing maternal and newborn deaths.“The Safe Delivery App provides up-to-date lifesaving procedures and practical guidance in the local language,” said Dr Bibek Kumar Lal, director of the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services, at the launch of the Nepali version of the Safe Delivery App. “It aims to improve the quality of emergency obstetric and newborn care, and the main users will be our frontline health workers, especially nurses and midwives.”Officials at the division said that the government has collaborated with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the Maternity Foundation (MF) to launch the Nepali version of the widely used digital health tool.Globally, every two minutes, a woman dies. In Nepal, two women die every day due to pregnancy-related complications—most of which are preventable, said Won Young Hong, a UNFPA representative in Nepal. “These are staggering numbers. UNFPA is pleased to work with the concerned stakeholders to localise this digital application so healthcare workers across Nepal can use it.”The Safe Delivery App is an evidence-based learning and training tool designed to support midwives, nurses, and other healthcare professionals to assist during births and to manage the most common complications. Among other features, it contains the latest clinical guidelines, animated instruction videos, descriptions of practical procedures, and action cards. It is free, and once downloaded on a smartphone or a tablet, it works offline, making it possible to be used even in the most remote areas. To date, more than 435,000 healthcare professionals across more than 70 countries have been reached through the Safe Delivery App and the accompanying programme worldwide, with Nepal being the latest country to introduce the App. “We will work with provincial governments and development partners to quickly roll out the App throughout Nepal,” said Lal.Nepal cut the maternal mortality rate from 539 per 100,000 births in 1996 to 239 per 100,000 births in 2016—for which the country even received a Millennium Award. According to the National Statistics Office report, the country has further reduced the number of deaths to 151 per 100,000 births in 2021. Maternal health experts, however, say that even if the country has made good progress in reducing maternal deaths, the current maternal mortality ratio is more than double the Sustainable Development Goals target, which is 70 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births by 2030.Neonatal deaths have not declined between 2016 and 2022, according to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022 carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population.The government’s target for the Sustainable Development Goals was to reduce neonatal mortality to 16 deaths per 1,000 live births by 2022 and 12 in every 1,000 live births by 2030.The SDGs, a follow-up on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), aim to end poverty, hunger, and all forms of inequality worldwide by 2030, and Nepal has committed to meeting the goals.The health ministry has been taking several measures to reduce maternal and neonatal deaths, including installing an underfloor heating system at birthing centres, setting up special newborn care units, training doctors, nurses, and paramedics in the district hospitals and distributing non-pneumatic anti-shock garments to prevent maternal deaths from excessive bleeding.Besides, the ministry provides free service and travel allowances for those opting for institutional delivery and antenatal visits. It also distributes misoprostol, a medication used to treat postpartum bleeding in new mothers, through female community health volunteers. \nAs heavy monsoon rains cause chaos across the country, dengue cases are surging in several districts, including Kathmandu.According to the Health Office Kathmandu, around 18 people are infected with the dengue virus every day. Officials, however, admit that this number could be just the tip of the iceberg, as the office gets reports only from 18 health facilities.“Yes, the number of people infected with the dengue virus could be several times higher than suggested by the reports we are getting every day,” said Dr Arjun Sapkota, chief of the Health Office, Kathmandu. “We are working to make daily reporting of dengue cases mandatory for private health facilities as well.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vectors also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus, according to the World Health Organisation.According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,432 people from 73 districts have been infected with the virus since January this year. Among the 73 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases with 159, followed by Jhapa with 120, Chitwan 83, Makawanpur 65, Tanahun and Doti 49 cases each, and Okhaldhunga and Sindhupalchowk 46 each.Sapkota informed that his office has sensitised the local bodies about the looming risk of a massive dengue outbreak in the coming days.“Mandatory reporting of dengue cases every day is among the preventive measures through which we can identify dengue hotspots,” said Sapkota. “This will help health workers target such measures in particular areas. Additionally, starting this week, we are resuming the “10 minutes at 10 am” initiative every Friday, during which mosquito breeding grounds will be destroyed.”Officials informed that several local units, including the Kathmandu Metropolitan City, have already started preventive measures against dengue. Dengue symptoms include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes. Patients with these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and proper medical care can prevent death.Doctors say many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and can be treated with paracetamol at home.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district. Since then, an increasing number of dengue infections, including major outbreaks, have been reported from many districts. Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Though the post-monsoon period is considered the dengue epidemic season, the deadly disease has already become endemic in Nepal, as outbreaks are reported every month, including in the winter months.According to health workers, storage places for scrap materials, discarded cups, plastic material tossed in open spaces, and unused lands will be potential hotspots for the dengue virus in the coming days. Health workers have warned the owners of these sites that action will be taken if mosquito larvae are found there.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects, such as plastic cups and bottles, could be breeding grounds for these mosquitoes. \nWith monsoon havoc sweeping across the country, the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division has urged health workers to avoid taking leave during the season.Officials have warned that health facilities could be overwhelmed by patients in the coming days as outbreaks of waterborne and vector-borne diseases are expected, as floodwaters have contaminated most of the drinking water sources.“We have requested the provincial and local health authorities not to grant leave to health workers during the monsoon season,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director of the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Health agencies have been cautioned about the looming risk of outbreaks of waterborne and vector-borne diseases in the coming days.”Torrential rainfall started Friday wreaking havoc in various places across the country. At least 14 people have died in disaster-related incidents—nine in landslides and five in floods—since Friday, according to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority. Officials said 18 others have been injured, and four people are missing. Since the monsoon entered the country on June 10, at least 43 people have died in landslides and flood-related incidents. Lightning strikes killed as many as 19 people during this period.The monsoon season in Nepal is a time of epidemics during which thousands of people across the country become infected with water-borne and vector-borne diseases.The persistent rainfall that started on Friday not only destroyed houses and inundated settlements but also contaminated drinking water sources.Health officials warned that health facilities could witness an uptick in the number of viral fever cases, and waterborne diseases—diarrhoea, dysentery, food poisoning, and snake bites—in the coming days.“We have also requested central hospitals and medical colleges to be prepared for help during disease outbreaks,” said Ghimire. “As we don’t have enough doctors and health workers to deploy to control the outbreaks, we have to seek help from big hospitals and medical colleges.”Officials at the Ministry of Health and Population said that they have been raising awareness through all available means to inform people of the risks. “Essential medicines have been stockpiled, health workers have been asked to be ready for deployment to affected areas, anti-snake venom has been supplied to health facilities,” said Dr Prakash Budhathoki, spokesperson at the Health Ministry. “As of Sunday evening, no outbreaks have been reported.”According to health experts, sources of drinking water generally become contaminated in disaster-hit areas, and people displaced by natural disasters become highly vulnerable to infections with waterborne and vector-borne diseases. Every year, thousands of people get infected with vector-borne diseases such as dengue, kala-azar, malaria, and scrub typhus during this period. Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts. According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,432 people from 73 districts have been infected with the dengue virus since January this year. Among the 73 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases: 159. Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. Likewise, snakebite incidents and resulting deaths are also common during the season, but the phenomenon, which experts dub “a lurking invisible crisis”, remains grossly neglected. “Incidents of snakebites have started to surge over the last few weeks,” said Dr Rajiv Jha, director at Provincial Health Directorate of Madhesh Province. “Along with the surge in waterborne and vector-borne diseases in the coming days, we have anticipated a rise in snakebite cases.”Doctors say the only ways to prevent deaths from waterborne diseases, including diarrhoea, are to raise awareness and ensure safe drinking water.They say a combination of careful surveys, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation and treatment are required to contain the spread of the diarrhoeal infection. \nWith the onset of the rainy season, the incidents of snakebite are on the rise in western Tarai districts.Snakebite treatment centres and hospitals in Kanchanpur and Kailali districts of Sudurpaschim province are now crowded with snakebite patients. Treatment of the snakebite patients, according to health workers, is quite challenging as patients are often brought to the health facilities at the last minute.As many as 60 snakebite patients visited the Snakebite Treatment Centre set up by Nepal Army at Arjuni of Shuklaphanta National Park within the past three weeks. “Over the past one week three to four snakebite patients have been visiting the centre on a daily basis,” said Ratan Bohora, a paramedic at the Arjuni-based Snakebite Treatment Centre. The local residents have hugely benefited after the Nepali Army and the local community jointly established the snakebite treatment centre at Arjuni in 2014. The centre, however, has to refer the patients with serious health conditions to other well facilitated hospitals due to the lack of an intensive care unit (ICU) and ventilator. “Two patients who were bitten by poisonous snakes were referred to Mahakali Provincial Hospital in Mahendranagar this year. We have no alternative but to send serious cases of snakebite to other hospitals due to the lack of the ICU and ventilator facilities,” said Bohora. The centre also does not even have a monitor to track a patient's vital signs such as blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen levels. The flow of the patients is increasing, but the centre only has two paramedics to provide treatment.Incidents of snakebite and resulting deaths are common in Nepal, but the issue still remains grossly neglected as what experts call a lurking ‘invisible crisis’. Each year, around 2,700 people, mostly children and women from Nepal’s Tarai region, die of snakebites, according to a March 2022 report.Most snakebite incidents occur when farmers are transplanting paddy fields or children are playing outdoors. Health workers say that the snakes that live in water are generally less poisonous. “The cases that are most serious occurred at night, often inside houses. Such patients should be taken to hospital immediately,” said Bohora. According to him, people living in thatched-roof houses are especially vulnerable to snakebite, because snakes often enter such homes in search of rats.Nepal is home to around 17 highly venomous snakes. Each year, the country sees about 20,000 to 40,000 cases of snakebite. The numbers could be higher, as many cases of snakebite go unreported, health workers say.Another health challenge in rural Nepal is the superstitious belief in visiting shamans instead of seeking treatment at medical facilities for snakebite. Experts say awareness drives should be launched to educate people that the snakebite patients should be taken to the hospital at the earliest. They recommend promoting cleanliness around homes, preventing children from playing in bushy areas, avoiding nightime walks, and using torchlight while walking in the dark.“Treatment of snakebite patients is possible if they are taken to health facilities on time. Patients are often brought to the hospital only after their condition has worsened, resulting in serious consequences,” said Dr Arjun Bhatta, medical superintendent at Mahakali Provincial Hospital. According to him, 10 snakebite patients with serious health conditions visited the hospital in the past three weeks. “They returned home after treatment,” said Bhatta. \nThe Thapathali-based Paropakar Maternity and Women’s Hospital is going to organise a healthy baby competition next month with an aim to raise awareness about overall baby development. Officials at the hospital said that the competition will not only assess physical growth and health of babies, several expert teams will also evaluate feeding practices, exclusive breastfeeding, immunisation, and the use of family planning methods by parents to ensure proper birth interval.“We would like to request parents of babies born at our hospital in the past year to register their babies for the contest,” said Dr Shree Prasad Adhikari, director at the hospital. “This is also an opportunity for parents to show how their parenting has been yielding positive results.”The hospital administration, however, said that the contest would be open only to babies born at the maternity hospital.Around 24,000 babies are born at the hospital each year, with around 39 percent delivered through the Caesarean section.The hospital administration said the contest will be held on August 13, coinciding with the hospital’s anniversary, and registration will start on July 16. Babies will be assessed in three categories—1 to 45 days, 45 days to six months, and six months to one year.Doctors say that babies' body mass index will be monitored to assess their growth.“We will also evaluate exclusive breastfeeding practices, administration of routine vaccines, and use of family planning methods,” said Adhikari. “We will form several teams of experts to assess the babies and award certificates to the top three babies in each category.”Doctors at the hospital said that the contest would help raise awareness of good parenting, exclusive breastfeeding, healthy feeding habits, the drawbacks of giving junk food to small children, and the importance of using family planning methods to maintain appropriate intervals between births.Studies show that the exclusive breastfeeding rate in Nepal has been steadily declining over the years. According to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022, exclusive breastfeeding has been continuously declining from 70 percent in 2011 to 56 percent in 2021.What concerns health officials is that more educated and well-off mothers are less likely to exclusively breastfeed their babies, as shown by studies.The report said the proportion of children who are bottle-fed rises with increasing education among mothers, ranging from 12 percent among mothers with no formal education to 49 percent among those with more than a secondary education. The use of a bottle with a nipple is the highest in the highest wealth quintile, at 46 percent, and lowest in the poorest quintile, at 11 percent.The proportion of children aged 0–5 months who are exclusively breastfed fluctuates across wealth quintiles. The proportion is highest in the lowest wealth quintile—64 percent—and lowest in the highest quintile—44 percent.The proportion of children who are bottle-fed is higher in urban areas, at 26 percent, than in rural areas, at 15 percent. The use of a bottle with a nipple is lowest in Karnali Province, at 11 percent, and in Madhesh Province, at 12 percent, and the highest in Bagmati Province, at 43 percent.The report also showed that bottle-feeding practices often start in health facilities. It showed that 22 percent of children born in a health facility receive mixed milk feeding (breast milk and fresh, packaged, or powdered animal milk or infant formula), as compared to 12 percent of those born at home. The World Health Organisation, however, does not recommend bottle feeding, stating that the nipple on a feeding bottle is susceptible to contamination and increases the risk of diseases among children.Nepal had committed to increasing the exclusive breastfeeding rate to more than 90 percent by 2030, but the rate declined from 70 percent in 2011 to 66 percent in 2016 and to 56 percent in 2022.The same report also shows that four percent of children received no vaccination between 2016 and 2021. Experts say feeding practices, exclusive breastfeeding, awareness about the importance of routine vaccination, and the use of family planning methods are basic things that determine not only the health of babies but also their future.  \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar. \nKhokana, a historic village near Lalitpur, showcases ancient architecture, mustard oil mills, and the Sikali Temple, offering a glimpse into the Kathmandu Valley's past while preserving a sense of community.\nA filmmaker embarks on a journey to Everest Base Camp to explore life's meaning and resilience, facing challenges, finding inspiration, and witnessing nature's wonders, ultimately embarking on a new chapter in their life.\nA group of journalists embarked on a five-day island-wide tour of Sri Lanka, visiting historical, religious, and natural landmarks while exploring the country's post-economic crisis tourism recovery and rich historical connections to ancient India and Nepal.\nFrom Mundhum Trek's breathtaking views to Janaki Mandir's rich history, Kuri Village's snowy vistas, Annapurna Base Camp's cultural immersion, Bardiya National Park's wildlife wonders, Khaptad National Park's serene beauty, and Limi Valley's remote charm, Nepal offers a diverse range of attractions.\nThe author revisits his hometown Phidim, finding it transformed with concrete buildings, paved roads, and increased urbanization, while grappling with the challenges of limited higher education and healthcare, resulting in an exodus of its people.\nEngland overcame late adversity to beat the Netherlands 2-1 and book a place in the Euro 2020 final, where they will face Spain on Sunday.\nColombia beat Uruguay 1-0 in their Copa America semi-final on Thursday despite being reduced to 10 men for 45 minutes to book a title decider against defending champions Argentina thanks to a first-half header from Jefferson Lerma.Uruguay’s Darwin Nunez missed several chances in the first half and Colombia made them pay when Lerma rose above the defence on a corner in the 39th minute and squeezed his header past goalkeeper Sergio Rochet.Colombia went down to 10 men just before halftime when Daniel Munoz lost his cool and got himself sent off, with the right back receiving a second yellow card for elbowing Manuel Ugarte in the chest when play was stopped.Uruguay dominated possession in the second half and veteran striker Luis Suarez nearly equalised when he hit the post but Colombia bravely held on for a famous win and will play Argentina in Sunday’s final.Uruguay will play Canada a day earlier in the third-place playoff. \nNepal national women’s cricket team suffered back-to-back defeat in their ACC Women’s T20 Asia Cup preparatory tour as they lost to Sri Lanka Development Squad by four wickets in their second practice match at Surrey Village Cricket Stadium in Maggona on Wednesday.Chasing 107 set by Nepal, Sri Lanka Development Squad overhauled the target in 19.5 overs losing six wickets.The hosts needed 20 runs from their last two overs, and Malki Madara played an explosive six-ball 16 to guide her side to victory.Senarathne and Imika Mendis had laid the foundation for the win with a 33-run opening stand.

Messi is second behind Cristiano Ronaldo, who has scored 130 goals for Portugal.Despite their two-goal cushion, Argentina had a nervy finish to the match as Canada substitute Tani Oluwaseyi tested Martinez with a crisp shot in the 89th minute before directing a glancing header wide a minute later.Argentina will take on either Uruguay or Colombia, who meet on Wednesday, in the final in Florida on Sunday. \nSpain struck twice in five minutes in a pulsating first half to secure a 2-1 comeback win over France on Tuesday as a record-breaking goal from teenager Lamine Yamal and a Dani Olmo effort propelled them into the Euro 2024 final.The 16-year-old Yamal cancelled out Randal Kolo Muani’s opener with a sublime shot in the 21st minute to become the youngest scorer in a Euro or World Cup before Olmo added another in the 25th for his third goal in the knockout stage.The Spaniards, who have won every game of the tournament so far, confirmed their favourites tag with another display of attacking football, especially in the first half, that is a far cry from the tiki-taka passing game that earned them world and European titles more than a decade ago.“I’m very happy to have made it to the final,” said man-of-the-match Yamal. “Now the most important thing is to win it. We were in a difficult moment, you wouldn’t expect a goal so soon.”“I wanted to put it in where it went in, and I’m very happy. I’m happy and content with the victory. I want to win, win and win,” added the teenager.They will now face the winners of Wednesday’s match between England and Netherlands in the final in Berlin on Sunday as they hunt a record-breaking fourth European crown.It was a anti-climactic end to France’s tournament, although the 2022 World Cup finalists never lived up to expectations in Germany with a very low conversion rate that carried into the semi-final.“Spain proved tonight that they are a very good team. We were fortunate to open the scoring, but they caused us problems because they were superior in terms of control,” said France coach Didier Deschamps.“Tonight they showed all their qualities. We were... perhaps a little less fresh, which led to some technical waste, particularly in the build-up of the game. We didn’t push forward often enough.”Spain had an early chance when Yamal, the youngest player to feature in a World Cup or Euro semi-final, floated a cross to the far post but Fabian Ruiz headed over the bar.FRANCE GOALFrance did better from an almost identical move in the ninth minute with Kylian Mbappe, playing without a mask after breaking his nose earlier in the tournament, crossing for Kolo Muani to head in their first goal from open play at Euro 2024.But the Spaniards, who were missing suspended Dani Carvajal and Robin Le Normand as well as injured Pedri, quickly turned the game around.Yamal curled a stunning left-footed effort from 25 metres in off the post to break another record held by Brazil great Pele, as the youngest scorer in a Euro or World Cup.Before France had any time to recover Olmo completed their lightning-quick comeback in the 25th with a shot that was deflected in by France’s Jules Kounde.France, who had only conceded one goal in their previous five games in the tournament, upped the tempo after the break and had chances through Mbappe and Theo Hernandez.But they could not carve out an equaliser with Spain, pulling back and successfully soaking up the pressure. \nResidents of Gaza City were trapped in houses and bodies lay uncollected in the streets under an intense new Israeli assault on Thursday, even as Washington pushed for a peace deal at talks in Egypt and Qatar.Hamas militants say a heavy Israeli assault on Gaza City this week could wreck efforts to finally end the war just as negotiations have entered the home stretch.Home to more than a quarter of Gaza’s residents before the war, Gaza City was destroyed during the first weeks of fighting last year, but hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have returned to homes in the ruins. They have now once again been ordered out by the Israeli military.The Gaza health ministry said it had reports of people trapped and others killed inside their houses in the Tel Al Hawa and Sabra districts of Gaza City, and rescuers could not reach them.The Civil Emergency Service said it estimated that at least 30 people had been killed in the Tel Al-Hawa and Rimal areas and it could not recover bodies from the streets there.Despite army instructions on Wednesday to residents of Gaza City that they can use two “safe routes” to head south, many residents refused to heed the order. Some posted a hashtag on social media: “We are not leaving”.“We will die but not leave to the south. We have tolerated starvation and bombs for nine months and we are ready to die as martyrs here,” said Mohammad Ali, 30, reached by text message.Ali, whose family has relocated several times within the city, said they had been running short of food, water and medicine.“The occupation bombs Gaza City as if the war was restarting. We hope there will be a ceasefire soon, but if not then is God’s will.”Withdrawal from ShejaiaJust east of Gaza City in the Shejaia suburb, residents were returning on foot to a desolate moonscape of destroyed buildings after Israeli forces withdrew following a two-week offensive there.The territory’s main cemetery had been bulldozed by the army. People wheeled supplies on the back of bicycles across rubble-strewn tracks, passing the remains of burnt-out and blasted Israeli armoured vehicles.“We have returned to Shejaia after 15 days. You can see the destruction. They spared nothing, even trees, there was a lot of greenery in this area. What is the guilt of stones and trees? And what is my guilt as a civilian?” resident Hatem Tayeh told Reuters in the ruins.“There are bodies of civilian people. What is the guilt of the civilian? Who are you fighting?”Israel launched its assault on the Gaza Strip last year after Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and capturing more than 250 hostages according to Israeli tallies.Since then, Israel’s assault has killed more than 38,000 according to medical authorities in Gaza.At the southern edge of the enclave in Rafah near the border with Egypt, where tanks have been operating in most of the city since May, residents said the army continued to blow up houses in the western and central areas, amid fighting with Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and other smaller factions.Palestinian health officials said four people were killed, including a child, in an Israeli air strike in Tel Al-Sultan in western Rafah.The Israeli military said earlier on Thursday around five rockets fired from the Rafah area were successfully intercepted.The negotiations in Qatar and Egypt follow important concessions last week from Hamas, which agreed that a truce could begin and some hostages released without Israel first agreeing to end the war.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who faces opposition within his right-wing cabinet to any deal that would halt the war until Hamas is vanquished, says a deal must allow Israel to resume fighting until it meets all its objectives.Two Hamas officials contacted by Reuters had no immediate comment on the content of the ongoing talks, led by Egypt, Qatar, and the United States.“There will be a meeting today between Hamas and the mediators to check on what responses they have received from the occupation,” said one Palestinian official close to the mediation, without elaboration. \nUS President Joe Biden told Britain’s new Prime Minister Keir Starmer that he welcomed his desire for closer ties with European counterparts, according to a UK government statement on Thursday.Starmer met Biden in the White House’s Oval Office on Wednesday where the two men discussed UK and US ties, the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza, and England’s soccer win in the semi-finals of Euro 2024.“The President welcomed the prime minister’s recent comments on establishing closer relationships with our European counterparts, as well as the UK’s commitment to AUKUS,” the British government said in a statement, referring to the security pact between Britain, the US and Australia.“They reflected that at a time when we face growing challenges across the world, we are at our strongest when we unite and work together.”Starmer was in Washington for the NATO summit, where he also met European leaders including Germany’s Olaf Scholz.Starmer has said he wants Britain to reset relations with the European Union to improve cooperation in areas such as security and trade, seeking to dampen the rancour that stemmed from Britain's 2016 referendum to leave the bloc.However he has ruled out any move to rejoin the European Union’s single market or customs union.The two leaders also agreed they must do whatever it takes to support Ukraine in its war with Russia, and discussed their joint desire for a ceasefire in Gaza to get hostages out, aid in and make progress towards a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. \nThe United States will start deploying longer range missiles in Germany in 2026, the two countries announced at a meeting of the NATO alliance on Tuesday, a major step aimed at countering what the allies say is a growing threat Russia poses to Europe.The decision will send Germany the most potent US weapons to be based on the European continent since the Cold War, in a clear warning to Russian President Vladimir Putin.A US-German statement said the “episodic deployments” were in preparation for longer-term stationing in Europe of capabilities that would include SM-6, Tomahawk and developmental hypersonic weapons with greater range.The move would have been banned under the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty signed by the US and the Soviet Union in 1987 but that collapsed in 2019.“We cannot discount the possibility of an attack against Allies’ sovereignty and territorial integrity,” the allies said in a communique released on Wednesday.More aid was headed to Ukraine as the allies bolster Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.A communique said the allies intend to provide Ukraine with at least 40 billion euros ($43.28 billion) in military aid within the next year, but stopped short of the multi-year commitment NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg had sought.The document also strengthened past NATO language on China, calling it a “decisive enabler” of Russia’s war effort in Ukraine and saying Beijing continues to pose systemic challenges to Euro-Atlantic security.Stoltenberg told reporters it was the first time the 32 allies had jointly labeled China a decisive enabler of Russia’s war and called it an important message.He said NATO was not an organization that imposes sanctions, but added: “At the end of the day, this will be for individual allies to make decisions, but I think the message we send from NATO from this summit is very clear.”The communique called on China to cease material and political support for Russia’s war effort and expressed concern about China’s space capabilities, referenced rapid expansion of its nuclear arsenal, and urged Beijing to engage in strategic risk reduction talks.NATO, “THE GREATEST ALLIANCE”Biden hosted NATO partners and allies at a dinner at the White House on Wednesday to celebrate what he called “the greatest alliance the world has ever known.”Biden said in a speech on Tuesday that NATO was “stronger than it’s ever been” and that Ukraine can and will stop Russian leader Putin “with our full, collective support.”On Wednesday, he said he was pleased all NATO members were pledging to expand their industrial bases and to develop plans for defense production at home.“We cannot allow the alliance to fall behind,” Biden said. “We can and will defend every inch of NATO territory and we'll do it together.”At the White House, Biden and new British Prime Minister Keir Starmer had a back-and-forth exchange and shared laughs and congratulations over England’s 2-1 win over the Netherlands in the Euro 2024 soccer tournament.Biden described the United Kingdom as the “knot” tying together the trans-Atlantic NATO alliance and said that the two countries must continue to cooperate.He also met at the summit venue with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada and Finland’s President Alexander Stubb of Finland to discuss strengthening their trilateral cooperation on economic issues and on defense industrial production.Biden, 81, has faced questions about his fitness for office after fumbling a June 27 debate and hopes the NATO spotlight will help him stage a comeback of sorts, surrounded by allied leaders he has spent his three years in office cultivating.However, November’s US presidential election could presage a sharp change in Washington’s support for Ukraine and NATO. Republican candidate Donald Trump, 78, has questioned the amount of aid given to Ukraine to fight Russia’s invasion and US support for allies generally. \nMukesh Ambani's son's wedding in Mumbai leads to traffic restrictions due to high-profile attendees, including celebrities and international dignitaries.\nNepal's book market is rife with unauthorized translations, with many popular foreign books being illegally translated without permission from authors or publishers, and without proper quality control.\nYouths from a former Maoist \"base area\" in Nepal have lost millions of rupees attempting illegal entry to the U.S. via traffickers, with eight deported and others still facing hardships and refugee cases.\nDespite government regulations requiring private hospitals to allocate 10% of beds for free treatment to the needy, many hospitals in Pokhara, Chitwan, Biratnagar, and Butwal blatantly ignore these mandates, depriving vulnerable patients of crucial services due to weak monitoring and lackadaisical enforcement by authorities.\nDespite his machinations to retain power, Prime Minister Dahal's alliance with Deuba and Oli led to his downfall, as evident in the appointment of the new government and the review of ineffective constitutional commissions, showcasing the unsteady nature of Nepal's politics.\nMasoud Pezeshkian, Iran's President-elect, plans discussions with foreign counterparts and may adopt policies impacting Afghan refugees after consulting with Ayatollah, but a dedicated Afghan refugee policy remains uncertain.\nThe 2015 Constitution marked a significant milestone in Nepal’s political history. Its formal implementation began with the election of the three levels of government—federal, provincial and local—in 2017. As Nepal enters a new phase of its political evolution, it is an opportune moment to consider necessary amendments to the constitution to strengthen federalism and democracy. The Post also published an editorial titled 'Easy does it' this Monday, highlighting the complexities involved in this process. The Nepali Congress and the Communist Party of Nepal (UML), the two major political parties, claim to have agreed to amend the constitution. If so, this is a positive step toward addressing critical governance issues. However, alliances and agreements between these major parties are precarious and prone to change, threatening political stability. There are talks of forming a national consensus government and amending the constitution, but the possibility and impact of such an endeavour remain questionable.Nine years after its promulgation, the constitution’s shortcomings and inconsistencies have become evident. A severe review of the constitution's implementation is necessary, and reforms and amendments must address these issues. The constitution should be seen as a dynamic and living document, not merely a source of problems. This approach emphasises continuous improvement to reflect the evolving political and social environment.A good constitution alone does not ensure good governance; it requires competent, sincere and committed leaders. The constitution issued by the Constituent Assembly is certainly an improvement over previous versions, but its implementation has been slow. Provincial and local governments have struggled to exercise the rights granted by the constitution. For instance, the constitution assigns provinces the exclusive right to exercise police powers, but this has not been allowed in practice.Frequent changes in power have caused dissatisfaction among citizens. While the United States has maintained the same federal constitution and governance system for over two centuries, Switzerland has had the same federal system for 176 years, Canada for 157 years, and India for 74 years. These countries have undergone repeated constitutional reforms to ensure stability. In contrast, Nepal has seen numerous changes in its governance system and constitution.Federalism is the cornerstone of Nepal's constitution. The issue lies not in the constitution itself but in its implementation by the rulers. Instead of addressing constitutional loopholes, leaders have exacerbated them. Reforms in the electoral system are essential to achieving stability and a better federal governance system. Nepal’s mixed electoral system has led to coalition governments. While some people lament that small parties play disproportional roles in the coalition culture, a coalition of diverse parties can also bring more comprehensive ideas and solutions for the country’s development. However, individual interests have often taken precedence over national interests, leading to a lack of collective accountability. Therefore, reform of the electoral system is inevitable.A significant debate revolves around whether to reduce the seats allocated for proportional representation in the House of Representatives. The proportional representation system was designed to ensure fair representation for women, Dalits and marginalised communities. Removing this system altogether, or even reducing its weightage, without addressing the underlying issues of representation, would be inappropriate and counterproductive. The fault lies not in the electoral system but in the political leadership that constantly changes alliances.Some politicians and analysts have proposed direct election of the Prime Minister and Chief Minister, which could lead to more stable governments. This change would require making parliamentary elections entirely proportional, ensuring that MPs focus on law-making and government oversight. They also propose reforming the structure of the provinces, as the current federal system does not appear to function effectively. Reducing the number of Members of Parliament (MPs) is necessary. The House of Representatives (HoR) currently has 275 seats, and the Provincial Assemblies together have 550 seats. The large size of the HoR and the provincial assemblies has resulted in huge expenses. The first-past-the-post (FPTP) voting system should ensure that everyone is directly elected, and the number of MPs should be adjusted accordingly. Reducing the number of MPs elected through the proportional electoral system—currently 110 in the HoR and 220 in the provincial assemblies—will also address the high costs associated with federalism. However, in the FPTP system, those elected via the proportional electoral system, such as women, Dalits and other marginalised communities, should be addressed with reserved constituencies. In such cases, elections should be held exclusively within these groups.The proportional electoral system is not inherently flawed. However, it has often benefited those with political connections or financial influence. To address this, proportional candidates should be elected based on joint votes from political parties and candidates, ensuring the people approve them. Amendments should include fixing the tenure of the Prime Minister, similar to the President and local level heads, who have two tenures. The PM should not serve more than two terms. Limiting MPs from becoming ministers can also reduce political corruption. Reducing the number of ministers is crucial; the current provision for up to 25 ministers is excessive. With the provincial and local levels taking more responsibilities, the number of ministries at the federal level should be reduced by half.Nepal's federal system must also streamline the number of departments and ministries. Many existing departments play insignificant roles and should be abolished or transferred to provinces. Stability at the provincial level is another critical issue. Frequent changes of Chief Ministers have led to public discontent. Direct elections for Chief Ministers can enhance accountability and stability. The constitution should be amended to allow the Vice President to become the Chairperson of the National Assembly. This will reduce additional expenses and enhance the role and effectiveness of the National Assembly.Amending the constitution requires a two-thirds majority in both houses of Parliament, which the Congress and the UML alone cannot achieve. Forming a national consensus government is necessary to garner the required support. However, significant contradictions among the parties on constitutional issues make it challenging to reach a consensus. These contradictions need to be addressed through dialogue and compromise to move forward effectively.The constitution outlines formal roles and duties and expects certain behaviour from political and institutional actors. Political parties, leadership, parliament, judiciary and constitutional bodies must establish actions aligned with the constitution's essence. Without this alignment, politics cannot gain people’s trust, and the Constitution becomes merely a tool for gaining power.Judicial reforms are also crucial for constitutional stability. The constitution must be amended to address these issues comprehensively. Disillusionment and mistrust towards political leadership and politics in general are prevalent. This sentiment stems from the opportunism of political leaders rather than the constitution and the system. We need a new generation of leaders who can feel the changing aspirations of society and maintain relevance in politics. Leadership should focus on long-term national interests rather than short-term personal gains.Nepal stands at a crossroads where constitutional amendments can pave the way for a more stable and prosperous future. The collaboration between major political parties and the lessons from international experiences underscore the importance of these reforms. By addressing the current challenges and ensuring proportional inclusive representation, Nepal can strengthen its federalism and democracy, fulfilling the aspirations of its people.Finally, amending the constitution alone will not solve the problems unless it is accompanied by a change in political culture and leaders’ attitudes and actions. Political stability and effectiveness depend on the commitment of political actors to uphold the principles of the constitution and work towards the common good. This holistic approach is essential for ensuring the constitution remains a robust and guiding document for the nation’s future. \nMonsoon-related disasters, epidemics (dengue, cholera, etc.), and water contamination have impacted Nepal in 2022, affecting healthcare resources and vulnerable populations.\nHeavy monsoon rains in Nepal since June 10th have caused floods and landslides, resulting in at least 70 deaths and widespread displacement, highlighting the vulnerability of the country to monsoon-related disasters.\nNepal's political leaders aim for a \"national consensus\" government by amending the constitution, despite needing a two-thirds majority they lack, sparking speculation about ulterior motives such as reducing proportional representation seats.\nTwo Nepali political giants, the Nepali Congress and CPN-UML, agreed to form a government under UML leader KP Sharma Oli and amend the constitution to enhance political stability.\nOver 52% of students failed to advance to grade 11 due to poor teacher quality, impractical grading system, inadequate preparation, and lack of resources in the new letter grading system implemented in SEE, leading to a debate about the test system.\nNepal's recent ambassadorial changes and the Prime Minister's India visit have raised questions about diplomatic decorum, ambassadorial selection, Nepal-India relations, and the progress of trade and BRI projects with China.\nThe government has decided to make the National ID Card mandatory in order to receive services from government and public institutions. In the first phase, the June 6 Cabinet meeting made the National ID card number mandatory in 28 districts. People including federal lawmakers criticised the decision saying that it was enforced without first distributing the cards. In this context, Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Yubaraj Katel, director general of the Department of National ID and Civil Registration.Let’s begin with a basic question. Why do we need a National ID card while we already have citizenship certificate, driving license, passport and voting card?There is a fundamental difference between a citizenship card and National ID. Citizenship establishes whether you are a citizen of the country and it helps you identify yourself with some basic details. In Nepal, it was also widely used as a service card. Wherever you go, you have to show the citizenship card—to open a bank account or acquire a SIM card for a phone. If we study international practices, there are mainly two cards—one is an identity card and the other is a service card. In 2018, the Nepal government came up with the idea of distributing national identity cards with a unique digital number for each eligible citizen. The number can track not only the individual but also the person’s activities and movements. This project has various components. First is data collection. It has two categories—demographic data, such as the names of father, mother and other family members. Second is biometric data—fingerprints, eye retina and digital signature. The biometric data is crucial to create a unique identity of each individual and avoid duplication in the integrated national database. The National ID has these two types of data. The other tasks are enrollment of the data, printing and distribution of the cards and then providing services based on that. At present, people carry multiple cards in their pockets. The objective of this project is to replace all of them by a single card–National ID. The new card includes vital details of all other cards in its chip with 1GB storage capacity. The government wanted to trace people based on their unique individual numbers so that there is no need to print and carry multiple cards. There is a huge industry of printing separate cards for each and every service that is creating a jumble of information. The National ID will not only replace multiple cards but also help authorities control criminal activities like financial frauds by removing duplication. At present, government authorities have difficulty in tracing and identifying an individual and wrongdoers are benefitting from that situation.What cards will be replaced by the National ID?It has a chip with 1GB storage capacity where you can store your driving license, academic documents, voting card, insurance details, ATM card number, etc. For instance, if you go to a telecom company to acquire a SIM card, they will ask for a copy of your citizenship card. You can say, ‘no, I have a National ID card’. Once you give your number and fingerprint, they can immediately verify it through the system. Another objective is to help people get rid of filling up pages of forms for each service. International governance has a norm that says don’t ask citizens their information more than once. A state agency should seek the information once and provide it to other state agencies if they require it. People complain that many agencies don’t accept National ID. They still ask for a citizenship card for official record and verification. So, in practice, it didn’t help people reduce the number of cards in their pockets. In fact, it added one more.Therefore, the June 6 Cabinet decision made the use of National ID cards compulsory in 28 districts. Now, it is going to be essential to get social security allowances, pensions and claim health insurance. The Health Insurance Board has said it has become challenging for them to verify whether a claimant is the rightful one. The board has 8 million policyholders. We will give them our details. Then, they can cross-check the authenticity of a claimant. This will help avoid huge financial frauds. In fact, the government should have made it mandatory earlier.But people including lawmakers in the federal parliament have strongly opposed the decision saying that the government made National ID mandatory without first distributing the cards to the people.Nepal’s total population is over 30 million. Our principal stakeholders are citizenship card holders. Those 16-year-olds are eligible for citizenship cards. The Election Commission distributes voting cards to those above 18 years. We got the data from the commission and added 20 percent and estimated that we have 18.6 people above 16 years old. As of Friday, we have already distributed the National ID numbers to 14.9 million people. Now, as per our estimate, around 3.7 million people are yet to get the National ID. Millions of people are abroad. Thus, we are headed towards saturation point in terms of data collection and issuance of the numbers. One thing I want to stress is that people don’t need a hard copy of the National ID card. The number is sufficient. Printing cards is costly. We have to pay around 2 euro to procure a blank card. The cost of printing, delivery and other overhead expenses is added to that. With the task of printing over a billion copies of ID cards being too costly, even India discourages use of hard copy of the cards. You can create the QR code of your card, save it in your mobile or print it in a paper and scan it wherever you need it.Officials at our government agencies bring up the rule that makes it mandatory to present a physical copy of citizenship card or other documents for official works.Yes, we are trained and habituated in that way. Now we need to change. We must make offices paperless while developing a strong database system. We have been using citizenship cards to verify the identity of a person for a long time. Biometrics not only helps identify people but also trace their activities. Recently, Rs2 billion was found in the bank accounts of a 26-year-old man. The money was deposited in 56 bank accounts. He used 13 ATM cards and 17 phone numbers. Once the National ID card is implemented, transactions and movements of such wrongdoers will be easily traced and monitored. Identifying individuals accurately is crucial to ensure good governance and strengthen security. Many people have acquired fake citizenship cards. People even made fake passports. Implementation of National ID will control it. It is also related to our national image. It will help improve the status of our passport and add authenticity to our other documents as well.Once the National ID comes into wide use, our details will be traced and used by multiple agencies. State agencies and other institutions benefit from the integrated database as they can easily trace us. But how do you ensure our data isn’t misused and it doesn’t make us insecure?If you have a National ID card, you don’t need a hard copy of your driving licence. There is a backlog of around 2.1 million licences. The government has failed to print and distribute them. We told them, we have already procured 12 million cards. Of them, 3.2 million cards have already been printed and we still need to print around 8 million cards. Once the licence data is integrated with the National ID card, it will be shown there. Now, to come to your question, only the traffic authority can access the licence-related data. The device they use will trace only relevant data. Only an authorised agency will get access to the data and it can’t be used for anything other than the stated purpose. We give access to agencies like Nepal Rastra Bank, Nepal Telecommunication Authority and Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal. Then they regulate the things in their domain. No unauthorised body or individual can access it. Do the implementing agencies have infrastructure to use this technology?We are in a position to implement it in some parts of the country. Therefore, we are implementing it in phases. We are making it mandatory for certain services in 28 districts from mid-July. We should have started much earlier. It must be expedited.Lawmakers said in a Parliament meeting that the decision has ‘terrorised people’ in the 28 districts as locals feared they might be deprived of the services as the government has made National ID cards mandatory without first distributing them.We started the National ID registration process from 2018. Registration teams reached in each local ward except in Mugu and Humla districts of Karnali. It was carried out as a campaign. Even after the drive’s completion, the registration process was open in all the 77 districts, 54 area administration offices and in palika (local unit) centres. We also had registration centres in major downtowns. We receive data of around 4,000 registrations a day. So, there has been sufficient initiative and enough time to encourage people to get the number. Besides, if anyone in the 28 districts are still to get the ID number, they still have three months to register.You said only an ID number but no hard copy was needed to access any kind of service, right?Exactly. There is no provision that states one should produce a hard copy to get any service. You give the number and your biometrics to verify that you are the right person. Then, the official can crosscheck it in the database within seconds.Do all the implementing agencies have the devices that read the National ID cards?We have distributed 4,200 machines that read the cards in 333 local units of the 28 districts. Likewise, we have asked other local units and districts and some agencies such as banks to procure the devices and we have given the specifications based on their requirements. A device costs just around Rs 1,500. You can enter the number and place your thumbprint on it. We have trained relevant officials from all the local units for the purpose.How many cards can the department print at present?We can produce 1,500 cards an hour. But now we are producing only 1,800 a day. We have the strength to distribute 30,000 cards a day but are distributing only 5,000 a day.Again the same question. Then why are people not getting the cards?There is some communication gap. People who registered in 2018 or 2019 haven’t contacted us. We are giving them priority to clear the backlogs. But people who are newly-registered are showing more interest. So, we need to strike the right balance.When will the department be in a position to distribute the cards to all the people?At present, we can print 100,000 cards a month. We have a space to double the capacity. Meanwhile, people have now shown more interest. By enhancing our facilities’ capacity, we can print the pending 8 million cards in the next 40 months.What about election cards? Do we need to register for that and get the voting cards?In fact, the Election Commission doesn’t need to collect data and issue cards. We will talk to them. As a constitutional body, we have to readily make the data available for them. In fact, the National ID Card system can help the commission make voting arrangements for the Nepalis abroad because it can accurately identify the right person and can immediately update the integrated system here in Nepal about the votes cast in any country. This card will be helpful in conducting fair elections because the biometric data stored in this system will be perfect bases to identify the people and instantly update the activities in the database.You have emphasised replacement of other cards by the National ID cards. How long may it take to do so?We plan on giving priority to three sectors—banking, civil aviation and telecom. People right now need to fill separate forms for these services that have irked the service seekers. We have asked the bankers to buy the devices. We as a supplier are ready. Now the stakeholders should be ready too. It will benefit them because it helps control frauds.What if I don’t register for the National ID card?In the first place, you will be deprived of social security funds, pension, insurance policies. Likewise, the government will gradually make the card compulsory to receive many other services such as driving licence, land transaction, telephone numbers, bank accounts. How do you assure that our data stored in this system isn’t misused?See, the current practices make you more vulnerable. Because multiple agencies take your data for various purposes. Do they have a system to protect the data and ensure that it isn’t misused? But when your data is stored only by a dedicated government agency, it will be more secure as the agency is specialised for that. When other authorised agencies seek data, we give them access only to the relevant one. We have a National Identity Management Information System (NIMIS). We have maintained three layers of security—L1, L2, L3—to ensure foolproof security of the data. There are three servers.Are we dependent on any foreign company for any related service?So far, only one international vendor is involved but we are cutting down its involvement as well, with a plan to ultimately replace it by our own agency. The vendor now helps transfer collected data to the printing machine through the Automated Biometric Identification System (ABIS). But our plan is to do so through our own government agency or local vendor. We do all the other tasks. Security printing is done within the office basement where every movement of people is monitored and recorded. \nThe implementation of the federal system in Nepal has faced challenges due to centralized decision-making, lack of commitment to federalism by major political parties, and a lack of clarity in constitutional provisions.\nHeavy rainfall with thunderstorms expected in eastern, central, and western Nepal, with isolated heavy rainfall in northern and far western regions.\nRainfall with thunder and lightning is expected in several regions on Wednesday, possibly heavy, with very heavy rainfall in parts of Koshi Province.\nLight to heavy rainfall with thunder and lightning predicted across multiple provinces, including the possibility of very heavy rainfall in some areas.\nCloudy conditions, scattered rainfall (light to heavy in some provinces), and moderate temperatures prevail nationwide.\n\nBe elaborative as possible.

Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nIt has been over a week since the Nepali Congress and CPN-UML agreed to form a new government under the leadership of the CPN-UML chair KP Oli, but they have yet to settle the ministry-wise portfolio division.Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who lost his majority after the UML and other parties withdrew their support, will face a vote of confidence on Friday as required by the constitution. This will be Dahal’s fifth floor test since becoming the prime minister in December 2022. It is almost certain that he will not secure the majority, which means President Ram Chandra Poudel will have to call for the formation of a new government. As soon as the prime minister fails the vote, Speaker Devraj Ghimire will inform President Poudel of the results. The UML is planning to claim the formation of the new government with the support of over two-thirds of the lawmakers, a central committee member of the party told the Post.But it is not clear whether the President will appoint Oli as the next prime minister after the UML submits the signature of the two-thirds lawmakers or he will give political parties one to three days to form a new government under Article 76 (3).President Poudel is consulting his team as well as his advisors, said an aide.As per the initial power-sharing agreement between Deuba and Oli, Congress will get 11 ministries and the UML will get 10. But as more parties have decided to extend support to Oli, they will need to accommodate other fringe parties in the government.Despite these preparations, the Congress and the UML have yet to finalise their nominees for ministers. Oli is likely to be sworn in on Tuesday once the prime minister election process is completed. Sources citing an informal agreement between the two parties said the Congress will lead the home and foreign affairs ministries, and the UML finance and defence ministries.“We are lobbying for General Secretary Gagan Thapa to lead the Congress team in the new government,” Bishwa Prakash Sharma, another general secretary of the party, told the Post. Thapa is interested to lead the Ministry of Home Affairs, but Congress chief Sher Bahadur Deuba wants Ramesh Lekhak as the new home minister, according to Congress leaders. “If Thapa leads another ministry, but is given the position of deputy prime minister, he should join the government,” said Sharma.Dozens of lawmakers have expressed their intent to become ministers this time, so the party’s leadership, including Deuba, is in a difficult situation regarding whom to send and whom not to.Deuba's spouse, Arzu Rana, is widely expected to be the next foreign minister. Other potential Congress ministers include Chandra Bhandari, Jeevan Pariyar, Tejulal Chaudhary, and Ajay Chaurasiya, among others. Besides Thapa, senior Nepali Congress leaders like Prakash Man Singh and Krishna Prasad Situala, among others, are also interested in leading the party in the new Cabinet, according to sources. General Secretary Sharma, however, told the Post that he would not join the new government. Singh, due to his senior position inside the party and the support he had extended in the past to help Deuba win the party presidency, president has a high chance of leading the Congress team in the government, if General Secretary Thapa does not join the government, according to Nepali Congress leaders. Thapa, has reportedly set some conditions, including deputy prime ministership, for him to lead the party’s team in the Oli Cabinet.Although Sharma claimed that they would lobby for Thapa, Thapa himself, speaking at a function in Biratnagar on Thursday, said he would not join the new government.“I have told the party leadership that I will work as general secretary and not join the government,” said Thapa.He also claimed that as soon as the process of forming the new government begins, the seven-point agreement signed between Oli and Deuba at midnight of July 1 will be made public.“We will discuss with the party president on Friday about sending the Congress team in the government under Thapa’s leadership,” said Sharma. However, UML chief Oli, who is all set to become the new prime minister, is reportedly against having the deputy prime minister portfolio this time. That is one major reason why the two parties have been unable to finalise the portfolio division.If the post of deputy prime minister remains, UML’s Bishnu Poudel, who previously served in that role, might be appointed deputy prime minister and finance minister, according to UML leaders. However, Oli is not keen on bringing Poudel into the Cabinet, according to the leaders. Padma Aryal, UML's party secretary, said a secretariat meeting of the party on Wednesday had already entrusted Oli with selecting ministers.There is also a long list of aspirants in the UML hoping to become ministers in the new Oli Cabinet. If the deputy prime minister portfolio is removed, Oli is likely to pick Rishikesh Pokhrel as the next finance minister, according to the leaders. Pokhrel is the chairman of the Public Account Committee of the House of Representatives. \nPushpa Kamal Dahal secured the vote of confidence in four consecutive tries after becoming the prime minister on December 25, 2022, but when he goes for his fifth on Friday, he is almost sure to fail.After CPN-UML, the largest coalition partner, withdrew its support to the government on July 3, Prime Minister Dahal has been leading the minority government.Soon after the UML withdrew its support, the Janata Samajbadi Party, led by Ashok Rai, also pulled the plug on the government. The CPN-UML has 77 seats and the newly formed Rai-led party has 7 seats in the House of Representatives.Dahal on July 5 decided to go for the floor test after the UML’s withdrawal of the support.Dahal opted for the floor test in accordance with Article 100(2) of the constitution which says, “If the political party which the prime minister represents is divided or a political party in coalition government withdraws its support, the prime minister shall table a motion in the House of Representatives for a vote of confidence within thirty days.”Dahal, who had the support of 268 lawmakers in his first attempt at a floor test, is likely to see that vote slashed by almost 200 this time.As things stood on Thursday, Dahal is most likely to get 32 votes from his CPN (Maoist Centre), 21 from the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) and 10 from the CPN (Unified Socialist).The parliamentary party meeting of Unified Socialist on Thursday decided to give Prime Minister Dahal the trust vote.Though the RSP has called a meeting of its parliamentary party on Friday morning, a party lawmaker said, “Since we have been continuing in the government despite being in a minority, we are morally bound to give the vote of trust to Prime Minister Dahal.”On July 4, RSP leaders had announced they’d quit the government but ministers from the party met the prime minister later that day and decided not to resign immediately. They said they backtracked on their plan after the prime minister sought their support until the floor test.To secure a majority in the 275-strong House, one needs 138 votes.The Congress and the UML, which have 88 and 77 House of Representatives seats, respectively, have already decided to vote against Prime Minister Dahal. Likewise, the Rastriya Prajantra Party, which has 14 seats, has also decided to vote against Dahal.The Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal, led by Upendra Yadav, and the Janata Samajbadi Party, led by Ashok Rai, which have 5 and 7 seats, respectively, have said they will vote against Dahal.The Loktantrik Samajbadi Party, which has four seats in the House, is also standing against Dahal during the floor test. “Our party is a member of the democratic alliance led by the Nepali Congress,” Ram Parkash Chaudhary, a lawmaker of the party, told the Post. “Therefore, we will vote against Prime Minister Dahal.”Dahal also will not get the trust vote of the Nagarik Unmukti Party. “Since our party has already withdrawn support to the Dahal government, our party will stand against him during the floor test,” Ranjita Shrestha, a lawmaker of the party, told the Post.The CK Raut-led Janamat Party, which has six seats in the lower house, will also stand against Prime Minister Dahal. “The party has already decided to stand against Prime Minister Dahal’s trust motion,” Abdul Khan, a lawmaker of the party, said.After the November 2022 election, Dahal, chief of the third-largest party in the House, continuously led the government for over one-and-a-half years exploiting the support of both the Congress and the UML, by turn. During this period, the UML backed Dahal two times while the Congress supported him once to form the government.Dahal first became the prime minister with the UML’s support. But the Congress was bent on breaking the UML-Maoist alliance and supported him in the vote of confidence after his swearing-in.After that, Dahal and Deuba started hobnobbing. When Dahal decided to support Congress candidate Ramchandra Paudel in the presidential election, the UML withdrew its support to the Dahal government on February 26, 2023.When Dahal faced the second floor test on March 20, he secured 172 votes in the House.Dahal, during the second trust vote, was supported by the Congress, Rastriya Swatantra Party, Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal (before the party split), Unified Socialist, Janamat Party, Loktantrik Samajbadi Party, Nagarik Unmukti Party, three independent lawmakers and a lawmaker of Rastriya Janamorcha.On March 4, Dahal broke its coalition with the Congress to join hands with the UML. He then went for the floor test for the third time on March 13.In his third floor test, Dahal received 157 votes from the UML, RSP, Janata Samajbadi Party, Unified Socialist, and Nagarik Unmukti Party, in addition to his own party.Meanwhile, Dahal again went for the floor test on May 20, for the fourth time, just two months after his third attempt. This time, he had to seek the parliament’s confidence after a group of seven lawmakers from his coalition partner Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal split the party and formed a new outfit under Ashok Rai’s leadership on May 5.After the party split, JSP-Nepal chair Upendra Yadav withdrew its support to the government. In the subsequent floor test, Dahal garnered 157 votes.Out of 12 political parties in the House of Representatives, along with the first and second largest parties—the Congress and the UML—other 10 parties and five independent lawmakers supported Dahal when he sought a vote of trust for the first time after the 2022 election.In the hung parliament, there are only two scenarios to form the government. Either the Congress and the UML should come together, or one of them should build the majority with the support of other fringe parties to form the government.This time, the Congress and the UML decided to forge a partnership despite the odds. As per the understanding between the two parties, UML chief KP Sharma Oli will lead a ‘national consensus government’ for a year and a half. After that, Sher Bahadur Deuba, the Congress president, will succeed him for the remaining term of the House. \nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that Nepal’s economy, still reeling from subdued domestic demand and post‑pandemic balance sheet repairs, may face an increasingly gloomy and uncertain outlook, mainly due to fragile political stability and cooperatives failure.The global lender, which provides policy advice and financing to its members to foster growth and financial stability, said Nepal’s fragile political stability could disrupt policy continuity and reform implementation. Nepal is set to elect the new prime minister next week. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is almost certain to fail the trust vote. This will be his fifth trust vote in a year and a half. The CPN-UML withdrew its support to the government on July 3 after it ditched its coalition with the CPN (Maoist Centre) and joined hands with the Nepali Congress to form a new government.This is the fourth time in Nepal’s political history that two major parties are forming a government without a powerful opposition, which observers say weakens democracy's effective functioning.On Tuesday, the IMF completed the fourth review under its four‑year extended credit facility, allowing Nepal to withdraw $41.3 million to help the country's economic recovery.This brings total disbursements under the extended credit facility for budget support to $247.7 million.The IMF executive board approved the extended credit facility arrangement for Nepal on January 12, 2022. The approved amount totals $371.6 million, which is 180 percent of Nepal’s special drawing rights quota (SDR) of 282.42 million.“Nepal’s economy continues to face challenges,” said the statement issued by the IMF on Thursday. It said that Nepal’s growth projected at 3 percent in the fiscal year 2023-24 remains below potential due to subdued domestic demand and post‑pandemic balance sheet repairs. The IMF has talked about Nepal’s cooperatives sector for the first time.In the statement, the IMF warned about the intensification of financial sector vulnerabilities, such as a further rise in non-performing loans. In this context, “more failures of cooperative lenders could endanger the banking system's soundness,” the IMF said.According to experts and bankers interviewed by the Post, cooperatives, which the government once embraced as one of the three pillars of the economy, are now threatening the economy.In Nepal, millions of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are heavily involved in cooperatives, and their failure could not only damage the fragile economy, but also harm social harmony, say experts. Cooperatives are involved in sectors ranging from dairy and livestock to tailoring and retail.Recently, thousands of victims of cooperatives fraud have staged protests in various parts of the country, demanding the return of deposits embezzled by cooperative operators. Hundreds of such depositors came to Kathmandu and staged protests. The government recently signed an agreement with them, promising to solve their problems as soon as possible.“The problem in the cooperative sector will shake up the banking sector. But if there is a wise move, the banking sector can absorb the shock,” said Upendra Poudyal, president of the Confederation of Banks and Financial Institutions Nepal. He said that the regulation of cooperatives has already been delayed. “We have seen that cooperatives are being operated for personal gains. A limited number of people took the benefit.” “Now, the central bank should begin with a single threshold. Limit the number and start supervision.” As of mid-March, there are 31,450 cooperatives in Nepal, with 7.38 million members. The deposit mobilisation in cooperatives amounted to Rs478 billion, while credit mobilisation stood at Rs405 billion. They currently employ 94,000 people.In a recent interview, Kashi Raj Dahal, immediate past chairman of the Crisis-ridden Cooperatives Management Committee, a government agency, told the Post that globally, most cooperatives work in productive sectors like food production, dairy, fruits and other agricultural activities. “But in Nepal, around 25,000 cooperatives are involved only in financial activities, mainly collecting deposits and issuing loans. Such cooperatives are now in crisis. Over 15,000 are registered to collect deposits. Even others registered as multi-purpose cooperatives primarily engage in savings and credits. Around 500 cooperatives are currently in trouble.”The Dahal-led government has promised the return of at least Rs500,000 to each depositor by recovering it from the directors' assets. Yet doubts persist about whether depositors will get back their money. Some economists have warned about potential mass protests if the cooperatives issue is not taken seriously.The IMF has also warned that the failure to raise the execution rate of large-scale projects would deprive the economy of much-needed stimulus and weigh on growth. On the pessimistic side, the IMF said that economic activity is expected to increase, reaching 4.9 percent in 2024-25, supported by more robust domestic demand. The statement reads that the cautiously accommodative monetary policy stance, the planned increase in capital expenditures in the 2024-25 budget, additional hydropower generation, and a continued rise in tourist arrivals are expected to boost domestic demand and growth. Inflation is expected to remain within the Nepal Rastra Bank’s (NRB) target ceiling of 5.5 percent.“Nepal has made important strides on its economic reform agenda. Decisive actions in monetary policy, bank regulation and rolling off Covid support policies played a major role in overcoming urgent balance of payments pressure in 2021-22,” said Bo Li, deputy managing director of IMF. “Reserves continue to rise without the need to use distortive import restrictions. Despite revenue shortfalls, fiscal discipline was maintained in 2022-23 and 2023-24. Bank supervision and regulation have improved by rolling out new supervisory information systems. Nepal’s medium-term outlook remains favourable as strategic investments in infrastructure, especially in the energy sector, are expected to support potential growth.”The IMF said that strengthening public investment management would support the needed boost to capital spending. Enhancing fiscal transparency will help contain fiscal risks and strengthen medium-term fiscal sustainability.“As monetary policy transmission is still weak in a context of balance sheet repair, a cautious and data-dependent monetary policy remains appropriate to preserve price and external stability,” the IMF said.  \nAmid an economic slowdown, the banking sector is looking for a slightly loose monetary policy to boost the confidence of the financial and private sectors, including individuals. The banking sector expects favourable working capital guidelines, which will open avenues for the financial industry and traders to increase their economic activities. In this context, the Post’s Krishana Prasain caught up with Upendra Prasad Poudel, chairman of Nabil Bank, to discuss the economy and the banking sector amid Nepal’s ballooning foreign exchange reserves and slowed lending. Excerpts:The monetary policy is due soon. What are the expectations of the banking industry?Our expectations from monetary policy are high as the country’s economy is going through a challenging situation. Some people say the economy is in crisis. But I don't call it a crisis because the external sector, including key economic indicators, is doing well. The country’s economy is looking for a boost—confidence where it will be easy for everyone to work in tandem. Our economic base is small. It will not take a long time for the economy to revive. In that background, we need a loose monetary policy to address everyone's needs.A loose monetary policy aims to stimulate economic activity and reduce unemployment by lowering interest rates and increasing the money supply. Without a loose monetary policy, building the private sector confidence is difficult. Liquidity is sufficient. To increase the credit demand, there is a need to boost consumption. To increase consumption, people need to have enough cash in their hands. That demands government and private sector investments. This depends on both fiscal and monetary policies. For instance, the construction sector is facing trouble, and as a result, there is not much economic activity with the government failing to pay the contractors. When contractors are not getting money, they are not giving it to workers. So the money is not reaching the people. As a result, consumption has remained stagnant. The government is not giving subsidies to agriculture or the insurance sector. We learn that the government needs more money. The private sector no longer trusts the government’s fiscal policy. In contrast, since the banking sector is regulated and disciplined, everyone looks up to monetary policy. Naturally, the private sector has high expectations from the central bank. What kind of policies are needed to revive the economy? As I said, public consumption needs to grow. To boost consumption, there is a need to increase credit. In the past, the banking sector made aggressive lending, but the credit did not go into the real economy or the productive sector. So, the central bank and commercial banks are now worried. Even though credit has seen a growth lately, the impact is not visible. At one level, the money needs to reach everyone's hands. So monetary policy needs to encourage credit flow. There is a slowdown in the banking industry, too. Banks are not able to offer dividends. Positive developments also exist. Interest has been cut, which will reduce capital costs, ultimately increasing output and consumption.Foreign exchange reserves are at a record high. Banks’ lending has yet to improve. What does this show?People are spending less. Reduced spending means that the demand for goods and services has declined. Even though the interest rate has declined, banks struggle to boost credit. As the foreign exchange rate increases, we have the space to increase imports. Banks have liquidity and the capacity to disburse funds. Interest rates are also declining, and the environment is becoming more conducive. But the demand for loans is a must. The confidence in the system must be high for the demand for loans to grow. The International Monetary Fund also indicates that Nepal’s situation may improve in the next fiscal year, depending on the monetary policy. What is sustainable banking? Why are Nepali banks reluctant to follow it?We look at sustainable banking in a futuristic way. We work for days beyond today. We work for tomorrow's generation. We work to make resources available for tomorrow. We must work to make everything sustainable. We have to preserve nature. Banks have gone for short-term profits. That's how we have deviated from sustainability. But our banks still need to go for sustainable practices. The central bank defines the productive sector including energy as the real economy. Investing in those sectors leads to sustainability.Our system ranks banks on the basis of profit, the number of depositors or the volume of loans. In reality, though, to be number one, the parameter should be the impact the bank has on the economy, environment, and society. Knowingly or unknowingly, everyone is talking about sustainable banking. Many banks have started reporting their carbon footprints. Many banks, including Nabil, have started various schemes for agriculture. There are products for women entrepreneurship for inclusive development and migrant workers as well. The banking sector needs to be aware of responsible investment. The central bank has been reinforcing this idea from time to time. How have cooperatives issues affected banks?As the financial system is interlinked, problems in the cooperative sector have impacted the banking sector directly or indirectly. Some cooperative deposits are with banks, and the bank's money has also gone to cooperatives. Not only cooperatives but some credit to loan sharks might have been sourced from banks, too. These are serious issues that need to be tackled prudently. We sense that the problem in the cooperatives sector will shake up the banking sector one day. The banking sector is highly regulated and has the capacity to absorb any shock, though it may not make a profit as before. Regulating cooperatives is difficult now: it’s already too late. The SME sector complains that getting bank loans isn’t easy. What can be done to increase credit flow?We are the custodians of depositors and cannot lend money to anyone easily. We draw a borderline to mitigate possible risk. Lack of financial literacy is still prevailing, and we have been working to create awareness. The financial sector has become transparent, but the private sector hasn’t. The government needs to create an environment that makes businesses transparent. The banks have started taking steps to develop and scale up entrepreneurship. Such initiative needs to be taken by the government, including the local level. The growth in entrepreneurship will stop our youths from going abroad. The government needs to spend heavily on developing entrepreneurship by supporting startups. Nepal has started cross-border digital payment. How has the banking sector started preparation, especially on the operating side?Banks have made a giant leap in terms of digital payment. Certain levels of credit are being approved online. Bank accounts are opened online, and security documents are automatically generated. We have moved ahead in the information and technology systems in the banking sector. However, we are still in the infancy when it comes to the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in the banking sector. To make transactions with India more comprehensive, we need support from Indian regulators, especially in preventing illegal transactions. With proper regulations and support, digital payments will boom. \nThe reconstruction of Achham Durbar, a historical palace in Mangalsen severely damaged by Maoist bombing during the insurgency, nears completion after 16 years.The local people are elated to see the palace being restored to its original shape and style. “The Achham Durbar is an identity of Mangalsen and the entire Achham district,” said Khagendra BK, a local resident. “The locals were anxious as the reconstruction work had commenced six years after the palace was damaged, and the work was delayed under various pretexts.”The historical palace was severely damaged when the Maoist insurgents bombed it on February 16, 2002. In the explosion, a total of 122 people were killed, including the then Chief District Officer Mohan Singh Khatri.In 2008, the government had allocated Rs22.5 million for the reconstruction of the palace, originally built in the style of Kathmandu’s Hanuman Dhoka Durbar. Locals say the reconstruction work was affected by political pressure and negligence of the contractor, among other things. BK said that major political parties repeatedly raised the issue of the palace reconstruction during election campaigns but forgot it afterwards. “The political parties here have made the palace an election agenda. Now, when it appears that the construction is almost complete, they are trying to take credit saying it was possible because of them,” he said. “The palace is almost ready. The remaining work should not be stopped under any pretext.” The palace, also known as Mangalsen Durbar, sits in the middle of the Mangalsen market. “Since the palace was destroyed, the entire market seems incomplete and quiet,” said 80-year-old Kapure Nagarjee, a resident of Mangalsen. “Even though it took years to rebuild, the palace looks just like how it used to. This palace is connected to the history of Achham. It feels like history has come alive rather than just being a reconstructed palace,” he said.The historical palace is being rebuilt under the supervision of the Department of Archaeology. As the project nears completion, discussions have started about its use and ownership. Padam Bahadur Bohara, mayor of Mangalsen Municipality, said now there should be a discussion about who will own it. “Government offices including the district administration office and the police office were housed in the palace when it was destroyed. Separate buildings for these offices are being built now,” said Bohara. “The palace can be used as a museum. But what should be kept in it. All the historical artefacts inside the durbar were destroyed in the attack. It is better to use the palace as an administrative office of Magalsen Municipality.”Chief District Officer of Achham, Shiva Prasad Lamsal, said that his office has been overseeing the construction work and the palace will be ready by the Dashain festival, which falls in the month of October. “The roof of the palace has been covered. So work can continue even when it’s raining,” he said. “The authorities and stakeholders should sit together and formulate operational guidelines for the management and protection of the palace.” Currently, about 90 percent of the reconstruction work is complete.For the reconstruction of the palace, a contract was signed in 2010 with five construction companies namely Rajendra, Saud, Tulchidurga, Badimalika and Kuwar. In the beginning, work was delayed as Meen Bahadur Kuwar was authorised to carry out the work, but other companies left after receiving some payments. Currently, Rajendra and Saud Construction are in charge of the construction. Jaya Bahadur Saud, director of Saud Construction, said the difficulty in sourcing the specific wood needed for the old structure has been causing some delays.Earlier, the palace housed various offices including the district administration office, land revenue office, district court, among others. But at the time of the Maoist attack, only the district administration office was there. In the incident, 122 people including 53 soldiers, 59 policemen, two civil servants including the chief district officer, and eight civilians were killed. The construction of Achham Durbar began 150 years ago during the reign of the local king TikaBhuk Shah of Magalsen and was completed in around 1878 during the reign of his son Dal Bahadur Shah. According to Surat Bahadur Shah, an expert on Achham’s history, the government bought the palace for Rs90,000 from Yogendra Bahadur Shah, the son of the Achham king, in 1972. Yogendra Bahadur's brother, Tapendra Bahadur Shah, who was an army general, facilitated the sale of the palace to the government.The original palace was a three-storey building 20 metres long and 16 metres wide, with 30 rooms. \nThe plan to pass three budget-related bills from the National Assembly failed on Thursday following a tussle between the ruling and opposition parties.Discussions and endorsement of the Finance Bill, Bill to Mobilise National Loans, and Tax-related Bill were on the agenda. But the meeting was deferred till Sunday.On June 30, when the CPN-UML was still part of the ruling alliance, the House of Representatives had endorsed the three bills through majority votes. They were then forwarded to the Assembly for discussion and endorsement.The bills would have been endorsed without any hiccup if it was not for the dramatic ‘political deal’ between the Nepali Congress and the UML on July 1, when the two largest parties decided to form a new government to replace the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led administration.The UML subsequently exited the Dahal government and took the opposition benches in the federal parliament.After preliminary discussions, Bhagwati Neupane, the UML chief whip in the upper house, registered an amendment to the Finance Bill. The ruling alliance is short of a majority in both houses as the Congress, the UML, the Janata Samajbadi Party (JSP) and the Loktantrik Samajbadi Party (LSP) have stood against the Dahal government.The four parties coming together means Neupane’s amendment bill would be endorsed proving that the Dahal government lacks majority. “The National Assembly was postponed in the fear that the amendment bill would be endorsed. Narayan Dahal, the chairperson, has colluded with the Maoist Centre to defer the meeting without consultation with other parties,” said a UML lawmaker. “The withdrawal of the amendment bill was the condition that the finance minister had set for tabling the budget related bills.”Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun was supposed to table the bills at the meeting.The tussle between the ruling and the opposition spilled into the public after the opposition parties and Pun issued statements and counter statements attacking each other. Issuing a joint statement, the chiefs of four opposition parties claimed that postponement of the meeting was a product of a malafide intention to bar the deliberations on the budget related bills in the National Assembly.“Postponement of the House meeting has hampered our constitutional and legal authority to comment [on the bills] and register amendments. We strongly condemn such irresponsible moves,” reads the joint statement. They have accused that the postponement decision was taken unilaterally without consulting them.National Assembly Chairperson Dahal was elected to the position on the Maoist Centre quota.The budget related bills are considered to have been endorsed if the upper house fails to take a decision on them within 15 days of receiving them. The opposition parties have alleged that the government wants the legal deadline to pass without holding discussions so that the bills get endorsed automatically.“The amendment was registered to revise the provision that promotes tax evasion amounting in billions of rupees,” reads the joint statement. “The minister avoided the meeting fearing that his conspiracy for policy corruption would be exposed.”Pun’s secretariat was quick to counter the joint statement saying he had informed Parliament and the Assembly chair that the bills will be discussed on Sunday and a decision on whether to endorse it would be taken the same day.Issuing a statement, his secretariat rubbished the allegations levelled by the four parties. It also raises a question over the UML’s intention to register an amendment to the bill that it had endorsed without questions in the lower house.“Whether the move to register the amendment to the bill by the party that endorsed it in the House of Representatives is ethical or falls under parliamentary culture is a matter of serious concern,” reads his statement.The Maoist Centre said the opposition parties were politicising the budget for their petty interests. “The House meeting was postponed as the finance minister had pre-committed tasks to accomplish,” Gopi Achhami Sarki, the Maoist Centre chief whip in the upper house, told the Post. “There was no need to make a fuss as the deliberations will be held on Sunday.”All the budget related bills must be endorsed from the upper house at least a couple of days before the commencement of the new fiscal year, which begins on Tuesday. After their endorsement by the Assembly, the bills need to be approved by the lower house before they are sent to the President’s Office for authentication. \nPrime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is all set to go today. After being taken for a ride turn-by-turn by a distant third CPN (Maoist Centre) led by Dahal, the two big parties in Parliament—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—have joined hands to form a coalition government. And with this, Dahal, who remained at or around the power centre for almost a decade even with his party performing poorly in polls, is pushed to the periphery—at least for a while. The overzealous commentaries about Dahal being thrown off the grid of power may, however, be premature. As per the current constitutional provisions, coalition culture is here to stay. And considering how adamant the political parties are in sticking to their morally corrupt politics, no one can tell if the impending Congress-UML coalition stays for the next three months or three years. As Dahal goes today, there does not seem to be much point assessing how well his coalition with the UML fared in just four months of its existence. It takes decades, even centuries, to build a nation. The five-year term of Parliament is the minimum required for a set of leaders to make some impactful decisions for the country. There certainly are provisions for changes in the government, even in the midst of the parliamentary term, but these should be exceptional cases. What we have got, however, is a perpetuity of the coalition culture. It is this perpetuity that has halted the nation-building process for decades now. With the same set of three old men playing the hot potato game around power, nation-building has become a staccato performance at best. Just as one performer comes to the stage and starts his performance, he is pushed to the sidelines in the middle of the act.Pushpa Kamal Dahal will perform the last scene of the four-month act that was his coalition. He will come on stage, search for UML chairperson KP Sharma Oli among the audience, and call him a betrayer. He will then look for the Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba and blame him for being power-hungry. Oli and Deuba will then take the stage by turns and blame Dahal for trying to take them for fools. Such acts have been repeatedly performed, with the same set of plots, performances and actors. There is certainly a new actor on the block, a television presenter who thought he had had enough of shouting out of the small screen. He stepped out of the screen into the field and competed with the old guards whose noses he wanted to break—as his infamous saying went.The moment Rabi Lamichhane came to the spotlight after an impressive electoral showing, the masks he had worn all along started falling off. After a while, he became the fourth old man in the club of politicians who see fault in everyone else besides themselves. Only that Lamichhane was louder, more contemptuous of the media, and as directionless as the other three when it came to envisioning a future for the nation. As Dahal is forced to step down and Oli is about to take the helm, it is worth pondering if this sordid cycle of drama will end anytime soon.  \nThere is a growing public outcry over rampant corruption in Nepal. People believe that corruption is widespread and institutionalised and involves political parties, senior government officials, local elected representatives, business communities and civil societies. New scandals seem to emerge constantly, with the government stepping up efforts in some cases but arresting only a few individuals involved, who are released soon after. Only junior officials or ordinary individuals are charged and made accountable, sparing the key masterminds and those with influence, party leaders, or senior government officials.Given the scale, magnitude and possible involvement of the highest level of political leadership and their patronage in the scandals, the public’s concern is that the institutions established to control corruption have become dysfunctional with the meddling of senior party or government officials or prominent business people. These institutions are primarily headed by individuals with patronage from the political party leadership, who protect the perpetrators manipulating the institution’s functioning. Furthermore, given that we have a united government with continued political negotiations taking place, there may be threats to pull down the government if certain give-and-takes are not met; thus, it is unlikely that any action will be taken against anyone involved. Deputy Prime Minister and senior political leader Narayan Kaji Shrestha recently stated that if the political party members are accused of corruption, the party leadership will complain and threaten the government to pull out their support. If any civil servants are arrested, the protest comes from civil service unions with threats of street-wise demonstrations. Similarly, if those controlling the economy are accused of wrongdoing, they accuse the government of taking steps to destroy the economy. He stated that all political parties, government and business people are wary of punishing their groups of wrongdoers. He questioned whether the government should punish only ordinary people, street vendors, small businessmen, labourers, or poor people if this is the case. He emphasised that it is impossible to have a clean government without real unity and united efforts by all parties to address corruption. Failure in sustainable developmentA massive increase in corruption continues to threaten the country's overall development, including jobs, infrastructure, health, human development, quality of life for every citizen and overall governance. Employment opportunities are less available in the absence of foreign investments and new industries. Lest we forget, some 75,000-80,000 people leave the country every month, seeking employment abroad. The quality of education in government schools has deteriorated significantly, with only 36 percent passing the latest SEE. Around 100,000 students went abroad for studies in 2023-24 and will most likely not return home. Nepal is bound to lose a new generation of skilled and educated workforce. Reputated public hospitals have become dysfunctional due to the non-availability of medicine, non-functional equipment and the absence of qualified medical professionals, who are often frustrated by a lack of prospects and seek employment abroad. Many private hospitals and educational institutions have been established but are beyond the reach of the vast majority.None of the major road projects have been completed on time in recent years. They often double the timeline, overshoot the budget and use substandard work, resulting in substantial economic loss and prolonged inconvenience and suffering to citizens due to bad road conditions, dust pollution and long travel times. Government offices providing basic services, such as the issuance of driving licenses and passports, are notorious for delayed services.Major scandalsSeveral major scandals that have been in the limelight in the country include gold smuggling, Bhutanese refugee scams, land properties surrounding the PM Office, the Ncell/Axiata sale case, OMNI-Covid-related purchases, the Giribandu Tea Estate case, Cooperative scandals and many more involving hundreds of millions of dollars. The main concern is that the real culprits are walking free, as they are part of the political leadership or individuals with solid party connections. As The Kathmandu Post put it in its recent editorial, “Rotten to the Roots”, indicating high local level corruption and “representatives have copied the ways of their federal leaders”. It is reported that out of 28,000 cases filed by the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA), half of the cases were at the local units in one year. Several such officials were recently reportedly suspended, and thus the local institutions cannot function, potentially threatening the whole process of devolution of power from the centre. Whether local units seriously lack good governance and fiscal transparency also needs to be verified and acted upon.Partnership against corruptionIt is gratifying that Nepal enjoys good friendship and cooperation with many countries, multilateral organisations and the UN, which have been keenly supporting Nepal’s sustainable development, peace processes and democratic transformation. Twenty-five years into the democratic process, there have been significant achievements and friends of Nepal should be proud of their partnerships and cooperation. Nepal is very fortunate that around 26 percent of the annual government budget is supported by development partners. Nepal is at a turning point, with its citizens increasingly concerned about intuitional corruption and the cartel system. In the absence of serious political commitments and weakness in government institutions, the situation risks further deterioration. This situation goes against the people’s aspirations for the overall sustainable development of Nepal, with a threat to security, stability and hard-earned democracy, devolution of power to the local level and failure to achieve the country’s graduation from LDC status. In 2014, major development partners and the UN joined together to remind the Nepali government of their concern regarding rising corruption. Leakage in aid leads to a trust deficit among donors, who continue to develop their strategies and find their way of delivering aid at the cost of the overall impact of development support. Nepal has ratified the 2011 UN Convention Against Corruption, so the government should take all measures to fight corruption. The current situation strongly requires development partners and multilateral institutions, including the UN, to continue to voice their concerns about the institutionalisation of corruption and closely engage with the government in supporting anti-corruption measures on multiple fronts. The outcomes of these efforts will have significant impacts, giving rise to greater values in development aid and across different sectors. Way forward Nepal should ensure that its citizens trust its intentions regarding good governance processes, and all known scandals must be transparently resolved. All governance institutions, such as the CIAA, should be reviewed to make them more effective and fully accountable. Every government public service should be improved through digitisation and targeted timelines, including, for example, the delivery of all pending driving licenses. The development partners must raise concerns about corruption and support the government in strengthening its accountability and transparency process with a robust digital system and other technical assistance. The government should occasionally provide exclusive briefings to the public, media and development partners on the measures it is taking to control corruption.  \nFatal attractions are a standard movie plotline, but they also occur in nature, with much more serious consequences. As a conservation biologist, I’ve seen them play out in some of Earth’s most remote locations, from the Gobi Desert to the Himalayan Highlands.In these locales, pastoralist communities graze camels, yaks and other livestock across wide ranges of land. The problem is that often these animals’ wild relatives live nearby, and huge, testosterone-driven wild males may try to mate with domestic or tamed relatives.Both animals and people lose in these encounters. Herders who try to protect their domestic stock risk injuries, emotional trauma, economic loss and sometimes death. Wild intruders can be displaced, harassed or killed.These clashes threaten iconic and endangered species, including Tibetan wild yaks, wild two-humped camels and Asia’s forest elephants. If the wild species are protected, herders may be forbidden from chasing or harming them, even in self-defense.Human-wildlife conflict is a widely recognized challenge around the world, but clashes in these remote outposts receive less attention than those in developed areas, such as pumas ranging into US exurbs. As I see it, protecting threatened and endangered species won’t be possible without also helping herders whose lives are affected by conservation policies.The drive to mateThe force driving these raids is pure biology. All domestic animals are descended from wild ancestors. Steeped in evolution, natural selection has favoured males who inseminate the most females—and females who leave reproductive offspring of their own. Attractions can go both ways: Sometimes smaller or less aggressive domestic males may mate with wild females.Many herding societies contend with this challenge. In the Hindu Kush mountain system of Central Asia and farther east, Tibetans, Uyghurs, Changpa and Nepalis raise domestic yaks, which provide meat, milk, transportation and shaggy hides for clothing.Wild yaks were once thought extinct in Nepal, until a team led by wildlife biologist Naresh Kusi rediscovered them in 2014. Now aggressive contests between domestic and wild yaks are headaches for local herders.In Africa, Namib Desert mountain zebras, a vulnerable species, have been bred by donkeys. In northern China and Mongolia, domestic and reintroduced Przewalski horses coexist in tense zones where herders work to prevent genetic exchanges. In Southeast Asia, wild cattle species, such as gaur and banteng, have mixed extensively with domestic cattle and buffaloes.In northern realms, caribou and reindeer, which are the same species, Rangifer taranadus, both occur in wild forms. Reindeer have also been domesticated and are central to Indigenous herding cultures in Scandinavia, Russia, Canada and Alaska. Caribou slaughters and separation efforts have not prevented mixing.In temperate zones of Europe and Asia, native species such as ibex, or wild goats, and argali, the world’s largest wild sheep, cause trouble by mingling with domesticated goats and sheep. In South America, guanacos—relatives of wild camels—range from sea level to the snow line in the Andes and attempt to interbreed with domestic llamas.The wild and the tameAcross Earth, humans raise about 5 billion head of livestock. In most places, wild ancestors are long gone, so herders don’t have to contend with interbreeding.The wild relatives that survive typically are rare or endangered. For example, there are about 43 million domestic donkeys, also known as asses, worldwide. But in the Horn of Africa, the sole remaining spot with native ancestors, fewer than 600 wild asses survive today.The same asymmetry exists in the Himalayan Highlands, where wild yaks—a critically important species for Tibetan people—are estimated to number perhaps 15,000 to 20,000, compared with 14 million domestic yaks. Globally, for each wild Bactrian camel, there are about 2,500 domesticated brethren.Even in protected areas of northern India, western Mongolia and western China, the abundance of domestic livestock outnumbers that of hoofed wildlife by a factor of about 19 to 1.As wild populations shrink, the remaining males have smaller mating pools, which makes them more likely to pursue domestic females. But hybridizing with domestic animals could lead to some wild animals’ extinction as genetically distinct species.No easy resolutionFor pastoralists, earning a living along Earth’s rarified edges is hard enough without wild animals raiding their herds. Frequently, the only legal weapons herders can use to defend their livestock or themselves are sticks and stones. Guns are rare and often illegal, either because the wild species is protected or because the nation bans or restricts gun ownership.Global conservation policy recognizes herders’ plight. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature, a network of governments and nongovernmental organizations that work to conserve life on Earth, affirms that Indigenous peoples play key roles in protecting threatened species and maintaining these wild animals’ genetic purity.Many relevant national governments also support both protecting wild species and aiding nomadic herders, at least in principle. These broad goals aren’t always upheld at the local level, however, especially when the people in question are pastoralists living in remote areas where it’s hard to access government help.Coexistence in a crowded worldWhen pastoralists need to protect their herds from other threats, such as snow leopards, brown bears or wolves, their main options are putting up fences, avoiding areas where carnivores are known to be present or killing the predators. Herders also castrate their domestic animals to keep them from fighting with other animals in the herd or attacking humans.None of these options work well for dealing with wild progenitors of species such as yaks and camels. Castrating wild males or reducing their geographic ranges makes it harder to protect and increase threatened species.Fencing is harmful because it can keep wild grazers from moving seasonally to different habitats. Wildlife migrations aren’t just important for the herd: As the animals roam and graze across broad areas, they fertilize grasslands. Arming pastoralists against wayward and aggressive wild males may seem justified, but destroying endangered species is a poor conservation path.Respect for Indigenous peoples’ traditional cultural practices is important. So are international agreements to protect biodiversity. In my view, these human-wildlife clashes demand serious discussions that bring together herders, conservationists and local and national governments to develop pragmatic strategies.Without creative solutions to prevent intermingling, more iconic animals will follow the disappointing paths of wild reindeer, bison and other wild species struggling to thrive as they increasingly collide with human societies.-The Conversation \nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has recently come under fire, both in India and abroad, for hugging Russian President Vladimir Putin even as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine shows no sign of ceasing. As expected, among the fiercest critics of the infamous hug is Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who called it a “huge disappointment and a devastating blow to peace efforts”. As Putin continues to be made a pariah by the Western world for his continued attack on Ukraine, India under Modi has made it clear that the world’s largest democracy cares more about the India-Russia military-industrial complex than international humanitarian concerns. Ordinary Indians do not seem to care about the intricacies of the Modi-Putin deal for arms trade. But they certainly do about the fact that Modi has convinced Putin to return the Indians who have been fighting Russia’s war against Ukraine. Like Nepalis, Indians, too, have been lured into joining the Russian Army. Like the Nepalis, Indian recruits have realised that the war is no walk in the park, that their agents sold them false dreams, and they now want to return home. Like the Nepalis, the Indians, too, have been killed in the senseless war, although in lesser numbers. According to Indian media, at least four Indians have been killed, while between 30 and 40 others are serving in the Russian Army. In contrast, a staggering 35 Nepalis have been killed in the war, while around 150 are still on the battlefield, waiting for the Nepali state to intervene and ensure their homecoming. Apart from returning those alive, Russia has also offered to expedite compensation to the families of the deceased Indian recruits. This is in sharp contrast to the fate of the deceased Nepalis, whose families have yet to receive any compensation. It has been months since the families of the fallen Nepalis started lobbying, demonstrating and organising sit-ins to put pressure on the government to take up the matter with its Russian counterpart. Government officials, including various foreign ministers, have claimed to be coordinating with Russian officials to repatriate the Nepali recruits. But the results are for all to see: Russia has turned a deaf ear to all such pleas.Notably, the recent agreement between Modi and Putin, which has yet to be made public, is the result of continuous homework by Indian government officials rather than just an outcome of Modi’s dinnertime charm offensive with Putin. The Indian Embassy in Moscow was consistently raising this issue. Likewise, Foreign minister S. Jaishankar was making a strong case for it in his meeting with the Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation in Astana, Kazakhstan, last week. This shows how the Indian government has been using multiple channels to ensure the repatriation of its citizens. Having faced almost 10 times the number of Indian casualties, Nepal’s plight is comparatively more dire. Nepal must, therefore, double up its efforts by putting diplomatic pressure, even using Russia’s allies, including India, to expedite the return of the Nepalis. First, Nepal must again summon the Russian ambassador to Nepal, Aleksei Novikov, and make him answerable for Russia’s failure to repatriate Nepali citizens becoming collateral damages in its senseless war with Ukraine. Of course, we don’t expect Pushpa Kamal Dahal and his government to wield the kind of diplomatic clout of Modi and his country, the fifth largest economy in the world. What galls is that the Nepali state has been unable to harness even its limited diplomatic apparatus for such a noble and urgent cause.  \nForeign Secretary Sewa Lamsal attended the Second BIMSTEC Foreign Ministers’ Retreat being held in New Delhi on Thursday.During the retreat session, Lamsal reaffirmed Nepal’s unwavering commitments to carry forward BIMSTEC process and stressed on enhanced collaborative efforts among member states to realise shared objectives of sustained peace, stability, and prosperity in the Bay of Bengal region. “She further emphasised that Nepal will continue pursuing a ‘whole of the region’ approach to harness resources for common benefits, strengthen institution-building processes, and transform BIMSTEC into an effective, results-oriented regional forum,” the Embassy of Nepal in New Delhi said.The foreign secretary also highlighted the importance of leveraging synergies of South Asia and South-East Asia to ensure tangible benefits to the people of the region and addressing pressing challenges including climate change, health-related pandemics, natural disasters and transnational organised crimes, reads the press release issued by the embassy.Lamsal also called on Indian Minister for External Affairs S Jaishankar and Hasan Mahmud, foreign minister of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh, separately. The discussions focused on various aspects of cordial and cooperative bilateral relations, including regional cooperation within the BIMSTEC forum. Foreign Secretary Lamsal is scheduled to join foreign ministers and heads of delegations of BIMSTEC member states for a joint call on Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the latter’s office in New Delhi today. \nUkraine on Thursday urged NATO allies to lift restrictions on its use of long-range weapons against targets in Russia, saying that would be “game-changer” in its war with Moscow, while China slammed NATO criticism of its support for Russia as biased and malicious.NATO members issued a declaration in support of Ukraine at a summit in Washington on Wednesday, promising additional aid and pledging to back its “irreversible path” to NATO membership.“At this summit we are turning a corner and putting in place the foundations for Ukraine to prevail,” NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told a news conference after a three-day meeting in Washington of the 32 NATO states.“Today, we send a strong message of unity and resolve to Moscow that violence and intimidation do not pay, and that Ukraine can count on NATO now for the long haul.”Zelenskiy earlier called on allies to preserve their unified support of Ukraine and said new aid had to be delivered quickly.“If we want to win, if we want to prevail, to save our country and to defend it, we need to lift all the limitations,” he said.Zelenskiy’s cabinet chief Andryi Yermak told a public forum Russia had no restrictions on its use of weapons and it would be “a real game-changer” if Ukraine’s allies could lift all limits on the use of those they supply to Ukraine.NATO members have taken different approaches to how Ukraine can use weapons they donate. Some have made clear Kyiv can use them to strike targets deep inside Russia while the United States has taken a narrower approach, allowing its weapons to be used only just inside Russia’s border against targets supporting Russian military operations in Ukraine.Biden told the press conference the United States had allowed Zelenskiy to use American weapons in a limited way within Russia’s borders.Biden said he and US military and intelligence officials were making decisions on “a day-to-day basis on how far they should go in. That’s a logical thing to do.’The United States and its allies have used this week's summit to try to project unity in the face of what they see as a rising threat to Europe from Russia and China.However, NATO member Hungary said ahead of a meeting of NATO members with partners from the so-called Indo-Pacific Four - Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea - that it does not want NATO to become an “anti-China” bloc, and will not support it doing so.Hungary’s Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto also told Hungarian state television that Ukraine’s admission to the military alliance would weaken unity in the group.Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban irked other NATO members with surprise visits to Kyiv, Moscow and Beijing in the past two weeks on a self-styled “peace mission”. He and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump will meet on Thursday at the latter’s Florida home, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.Orban’s meeting in Moscow with Russian President Vladimir Putin in particular angered some fellow NATO allies, who said the trip handed legitimacy to Putin’s claims to Ukrainian territory seized since Russia’s 2022 invasion.Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, told a public forum he would not speculate on whether Orban’s trip to Moscow was coordinated with Trump, Biden’s rival in the November US election, but said the Ukrainians had grave misgivings about any effort to negotiate a peace deal without them.“So whatever adventurism is being undertaken without Ukraine’s consent or support is not something that’s consistent with our policy, the foreign policy of the United States,” he said.ANGRY WORDS FROM CHINAWednesday’s NATO declaration included sharp words about China, calling it “a decisive enabler” of Russia’s war in Ukraine, and said Beijing continues to pose systemic challenges to Europe and to security.China’s Foreign Ministry said the declaration was biased and “sowing discord” and its mission to the European Union described it as being “full of Cold War mentality and belligerent rhetoric, and China-related content full of provocations, lies, incitement and smears.”At the news conference, Stoltenberg recalled language in the declaration by saying that “China cannot continue to fuel the largest military conflict in Europe without this impacting Beijing's interests and reputation.”China has repeatedly lashed out at NATO criticisms and has warned against its expansion into the Indo-Pacific.Japan, South Korea, New Zealand and Australia have forged stronger ties with NATO amid rising concerns over China’s pressure on rival claimants in disputed waters in the region and on democratic Taiwan, the global hub of cutting-edge chip production, which Beijing claims as its own. \nThe weather today will be generally to mostly cloudy throughout the country.Koshi, Madhesh, Bagmai, Gandaki and Lumbini provinces are expected to experience heavy to very heavy rainfall at a few places heavy rainfall has also been forecast at one or two places in Karnali and Sudurpaschim provinces.Light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is likely to occur across the country.The weather is likely to remain the same until later tonight.Heavy rainfall may continue in Koshi, Madhesh and Gandaki provinces while light rainfall is likely to occur in some places of Bagmati province.Dipayal recorded a maximum temperature of 35.7 degrees Celsius on Thursday while Jomsom had a minimum temperature of 15.5 degrees Celsius. \nMonsoon-induced disasters have claimed the lives of 88 people across Nepal in the past month.According to Nepal Police, as of Thursday, floods, landslides, and other monsoon-induced disasters killed 25 people in Gandaki Province, 23 in Lumbini, 19 in Koshi, seven in Sudurpaschim, six in Bagmati, and four each in Madhesh and Karnali provinces.Likewise, 106 people were injured across the country, including 31 in Koshi Province, 26 in Gandaki, 15 in Karnali, 11 in Sudurpaschim, nine in Lumbini, and seven each in Madhesh and Bagmati provinces.According to Nepal Police, six people are missing due to floods and landslides across the country. Two each are missing in Koshi and Bagmati provinces and one each in Gandaki and Sudurpaschim provinces. Search and rescue operations are currently underway to locate the missing individuals.A total of 161 houses, 68 sheds, 41 bridges, one school, and two government offices were damaged during the period, which displaced 3,462 households and killed 479 cattle.Meanwhile, the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology has forecast extremely heavy rainfall in some places of the country until Saturday morning.According to a special bulletin issued by the department, most parts of the country will witness light to moderate rainfall and some places could see extremely heavy rainfall until Saturday morning.Some places of Koshi, Madhesh, Gandaki, and Lumbini provinces could witness rain with thunder and lightning in that period. Extremely heavy rainfall is likely in some places of the four provinces.Red alerts have been issued in 43 districts of Koshi, Madhesh, Bagmati, Gandaki and Lumbini provinces. Yellow alerts have been issued in the remaining 34 districts, including all three districts of Valley—Kathmandu, Lalitpur and Bhaktapur. \nThe Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved disbursement of US$41 million for Nepal on Tuesday.Concluding its fourth review under the four-year Extended Credit Facility (ECF), the international organisation allowed authorities to withdraw the equivalent of US$41.3 million, taking the total disbursement of financial support to Nepal under the programme to US$247.7 million.“Nepal has made good progress with the implementation of the programme, which has helped mitigate the impact of the pandemic and global shocks on economic activity, protect vulnerable groups, and preserve macroeconomic and financial stability,” the IMF said in a statement. According to the global financial agency, Nepal’s projected economic growth for fiscal 2023/24, which is around 3 percent, remains below potential in subdued domestic demand and post‑pandemic balance sheet repairs as the economy continues to face challenges.However, economic activity is expected to pick up with growth reaching 4.9 percent in FY2024/25, supported by stronger domestic demand.“The cautiously accommodative monetary policy stance, planned increase in capital expenditure in the FY2024/25 budget, additional hydropower generation, and a continued increase in tourist arrivals are expected to boost domestic demand and growth,” the statement further reads. Inflation is expected to remain within the Nepal Rastra Bank’s (NRB) target ceiling of 5.5 percent.The IMF has also warned that a failure to raise the execution rate of capital projects would deprive the economy of much-needed stimulus and weigh on growth as ‘domestic risks dominate the outlook.’Despite the country’s cautiously accommodative monetary policy, fragile political stability could disrupt policy continuity and reform implementation. “Intensification of financial sector vulnerabilities such as a further rise in non-performing loans (NPL) or more failures of cooperative lenders could endanger banking system soundness,” the agency said, adding that “high commodity prices could slow the recovery in energy-intensive sectors.”“As monetary policy transmission is still weak in a context of balance sheet repair, a cautious and data dependent monetary policy remains appropriate to preserve price and external stability,” said Bo Li, deputy managing director and acting chair of the IMF’s executive board.“Continuing to strengthen Nepal’s financial system remains a top priority. Financial policy should remain vigilant and focused on building regulatory frameworks that promote sustainable credit growth while proactively addressing emerging vulnerabilities in the savings and credit cooperatives sector.”Li added that a cautious and data dependent monetary policy remains appropriate to preserve price and external stability as monetary policy transmission is still weak in a context of balance sheet repair.“Continued progress on the structural front—improving the business climate, building human capital, and continuing to improve social safety nets—remains needed to foster investment and more inclusive growth,” he added.Li suggested that Nepal should also emphasise the full execution of the child grant budget, followed by an expansion of the program to all districts in Nepal.  \nChinese imports into Nepal surged 34.8% due to increased EV demand, while Indian imports declined 3.1% amid export restrictions, indicating a shift in Nepal's trade towards China despite India's dominant share.\nThe National Human Rights Commission calls for inclusion of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and justice for former Maoist child soldiers in the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry Act.\nIn 1980s, Nepal's communist leader Mohan Bikram Singh founded CPN (CPN-Maoist), led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who navigated a violent conflict for a more inclusive Nepal despite political setbacks and personal insecurities, but now faces an impending downfall due to his unreliability as a coalition partner and a flawed electoral system.\nNepal's electric vehicle (EV) imports have surged, with China accounting for two-thirds of imports and outpacing conventional vehicle imports due to increased consumer adoption, government incentives, and easy financing.\nDespite a budget claim that all districts are connected to the national road network, Humla district remains isolated due to the lack of a bridge over the Karnali river, resulting in increased transportation costs and hardships for residents.\nKey events unfold as characters confront adversity, make choices, and navigate the consequences of their actions, ultimately shaping their destinies.\n\nSri Lanka, featuring ancient irrigation systems, faced financial crisis in 2022, but tourism is now revitalizing the island nation after a recent Post travel journey covering 70% of its territory.\nEducation in Every Home’s report titled ‘Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in Nepal’s Textbooks’ highlights the lack of diversity, inclusivity, and inaccuracies in these textbooks.  The findings include egregious mistakes in textbooks like the inclusion of a letter Abraham Lincloln supposedly wrote—dating to a time 17 years after his assassination, to assertions like Brazil has tigers, elephants and rhinos while Germany has tigers and monkeys. The books display a clear bias in favour of Brahmin Chhetri males, while women make up just 18 percent of all people profiled. While 80 percent of all bylines are male, the presence of marginalised communities, especially Dalits, is nearly non-existent.  \nDia Yonzon (she/her) is a writer and researcher. She runs The Melung Stories, a platform dedicated to amplifying the literary and artistic expressions of queer and indigenous communities. Yonzon is also affiliated with the Writing Center at the Open Institute of Social Science.In this conversation with the Post’s Rishika Dhakal, Yonzon talks about queer literature, her work at UN Women Nepal, and the books that have influenced her.How has your background in law and arts influenced your approach to advocacy and activism at UN Women Nepal?I worked at the UN Women Nepal for three years. My background in law had a direct influence on my work. However, I never wanted to become a practising lawyer; I just wanted to understand the philosophy of law. While studying law, I gravitated towards the field of human rights.Currently, I am involved in creating art and literature. I realised that when we need to say something in society, more than logistics and data, what touches people’s hearts is art. It is because art shapes us in subtle ways, knowingly or unknowingly.Reading feminist literature has also shaped my activism. So, everything I do has been shaped by the books I read. For example, many people dismiss ‘Pride and Prejudice’ as cheap literature. But once you read the book, you will find that Jane Austen provided satirical commentary on the era in which she was born.Even today, we tend to dismiss literature. Art and literature provide a subtle glimpse of the contemporary world.The first book that made a significant impact on you and why?I mostly write about how time and space affect love. As a child, I remember reading ‘The Time Traveller’s Wife’, the first book I purchased with pocket money.And now that I think about it, the book significantly influenced me because I am a sucker for romance. The story centres on a timeless love that transcends specific moments and places. This one component resonated with me.But as my writing grew, I realised it didn’t necessarily have to be about sci-fi. I write about general things, such as how people express love. I developed that by reading ‘The Time Traveller’s Wife’.In your experience, how important is queer literature for the representation and empowerment of queer individuals?While growing up, I didn’t see much mainstream literature that had queer representation. This made me feel like I was some sort of outcast. And it wasn’t just me who felt this way; others did, too. You want to feel you are being represented. During my childhood, there was only one mainstream memoir about a gay person that I remember. Nepali literature should be more diverse. As it will allow young people from such communities to feel like they are being represented. The greater the presence of queer literature, the more normalised it will become.Currently, the representation of queer people is disheartening, often depicting their lives as solely filled with suffering. By discussing the various dimensions of queer life, including joy and sadness, we can normalise these experiences. This helps non-queer allies to relate and understand better.One of my major concerns is that we only have access to popular media, which limits our understanding of contemporary society in the past. For queer people, this is especially troubling because there are no reference points to learn about their experiences and situations back then.Decades ago, queerness was vilified. Films like ‘Chandigarh Kare Aashiqui’, reflect minor narrative shifts in our society, even if they are misguided portrayals of the experiences of queer people.Compared to the past, many people today are discussing queerness, indicating a significant societal shift. This is why it is crucial to write more queer stories now. From a documentary and archival perspective, these stories will be invaluable for understanding the experiences of queer people in the future.As someone who is into fiction, how do you think it can contribute to understanding social issues?Fiction reflects contemporary society and its conversations, ultimately allowing us to address various prevalent issues. In fiction, if you’re a man reading a novel with a female protagonist, you can immerse yourself in the protagonist’s experience. Because fiction is a story, it isn’t necessarily preachy. It doesn’t order people to do this or that. Instead, it builds a world and invites people to explore it. No subject is one-dimensional, so it allows you to explore everything. Speculative fiction lets us see what might happen if we continue on a certain path.By capturing all the small nuances of society in the story, we can amplify and highlight issues that have not received the attention they deserve.What books would you recommend to non-queer allies who want to better understand and support queer communities?Many smaller publications help in aiding one's understanding of queerness. Recently, we conducted a 10-day residency titled ‘A Room of One’s Own’. The UN, Katha Satha, and the Open Institute supported the residency. At the end of it, we published a book of the same title. One can follow magazines like ‘Queerbad’ by the Queer Muslim Project (TQMP), which features stories written by queer writers from South Asia. Similarly, the ‘A Room of One’s Own: Queer Writer’s Residency’ publication can also be followed. Additionally, small independent zines such as ‘A Song of Revolution’ from Nepal should be considered.For more accessible reads, I recommend Niranjan Kunwar’s ‘Between Queens and the Cities’ and ‘Beyond the Gender Binary’ by Alok Vaid-Menon. Ocean Vuong's ‘On Earth, We’re Briefly Gorgeous’ is also an excellent work of fiction that provides insight into queer experiences.Can you share about the Melung stories writing workshop? How do these workshops contribute to the queer and indigenous literary community?Melung Stories is a storytelling platform. They document and archive stories of queer people. Writing is not seen as a lucrative job. Even if one chooses to be a writer, they need a community. The community I speak of includes editors, readers, and publishers who will support you. Plus, there is no certainty that it will pay you. In that context, many people who belong to indigenous or marginalised communities avoid writing and instead take up stable jobs that pay well. So, who ends up writing? Folks who already have resources, have generational wealth or can make time for themselves. In our workshop, we target queer and indigenous people. We want to give them resources, time, space, guidance, and a certain agency. There are lots of people who want to share their stories but don’t have the time or the space to do so. So, in Melung stories, we give them time and space. And their stories get recorded. How do you envision the future of queer literature and representation in Nepal?When discussing art and literature, we assume they are void of societal issues. This is because the language we use to discuss them is sophisticated. However, art and literature are not created in a vacuum. They feed off of society and reflect the society we live in. Nepal and South Asia need more diverse voices to tell authentic and meaningful queer stories. Queer literature shouldn’t be limited to biographies and memoirs; it can include fiction, biography, or sci-fi to reach a broader audience. Queer books shouldn’t be treated as rare treasures but should be made widely accessible.Diya Yonzon’s book recommendationsThe God of Small ThingsAuthor: Arundhati RoyPublisher: Random HouseYear: 1997The book tells the story of two fraternal twins.

GB Rai, who is at large, is believed to have fled the country.In its terms of reference (ToR), the committee has divided the cooperatives it has to investigate into two categories. It has listed the 20 cooperatives declared problematic ones by the government’s Crisis-ridden Cooperatives Management Committee in its schedule 1 and nine others including those linked to the Gorkha Media Network in the schedule 2.The committee had planned to first listen to the victims who deposited money in the cooperatives listed in the schedule 1 and then move on to schedule 2.After listening to the cooperative victims’ grievances on Wednesday, the committee members decided to hold discussions on the cooperatives listed in the schedule 2.“Soon, the parliamentary special probe committee will start discussion on the fourth point [that mentions the schedule 2],” Lekh Nath Dahal, a member of the parliamentary special probe committee, told the Post.As per the ToR, the probe panel will conduct a study and make recommendations on resolving legal and institutional issues faced by cooperatives and on regulations, supervision, and transparency of their financial systems.Coordinators of various struggle committees formed by cooperative victims were also present during the discussion. Chair of the parliamentary probe panel, Surya Thapa, a lawmaker from CPN-UML, said that they invited the representatives to listen to their grievances as the victims’ suggestions would be crucial in reaching a conclusion on the matter.Speaking in a discussion with the House committee, Shaligram Duwadi, a victim of Sahara Multi-Purpose Cooperatives from Chitwan, said that Rs510 million was rerouted from the cooperative to the Gorkha Media Network.“We tried to lodge the complaint against Gorkha Media Network with Chitwan Police but they refused to register our complaint after they saw the name of Gorkha Media Network,” Duwadi was quoted as saying by a member of the special probe committee. “Why was the case not registered by Chitwan Police?”Likewise, the committee member said Krishna Pariyar, a cooperative victim of Swarnalaxmi Saving and Credit Cooperative of Kathmandu, also accused Home Minister Lamichhane of abusing state power by not letting him withdraw his money and cash his cheque.“Though the victims of many cooperatives were present in the meeting today [Wednesday], the discussion was more focused on the chairman and managing director of Gorkha Media Network,” said the committee member.According to the committee member, the victims stressed that no matter how powerful these two people [Rai and Lamichhane] are, they should be booked under the law.The parliamentary special probe committee invited representatives from 29 cooperatives mentioned in the ToR but most of those present at the meeting were victims from the cooperatives linked to the media company, according to committee members.“Though victims from other cooperatives were also present at the committee meeting, most of them were those whose money was embezzled by the Gorkha Media Network,” Ishwari Devi Neupane, a probe committee member representing Nepali Congress, told the Post. Listed under schedule 2 of the ToR or linked to the media company are: the Ideal Yamuna Multipurpose Cooperative, the Image Saving and Credit Cooperative, the Sahara Saving and Cooperative, the Samanata Saving and Credit Cooperative, the Sano Paila Saving and Credit Cooperative, the Supreme Saving and Credit Cooperative, the Suryadarshan Saving and Credit Cooperative, the Sumeru Saving and Credit Cooperative and the Swarnalaxmi Saving and Credit Cooperative.Reportedly, money from Butwal-based Supreme Saving and Credit Cooperative, Suryadarshan Saving and Credit and Cooperative of Pokhara, Sahara Saving and Cooperative of Chitwan, Swarnalaxmi Saving and Credit Cooperative of Kathmandu, Sano Paila Saving and Credit Cooperative of Birgunj, and Nepalgunj’s Samantha Saving and Credit Cooperative has been rerouted to the Gorkha Media Network.Before this, the committee held discussions with top government officials including Secretary of the Ministry of Home Affairs Ek Narayan Aryal and Inspector General of Police (IGP) Basanta Bahadur Kunwar, among other officials, on July 4 to discuss the cooperatives under investigation.On the same day, Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) Chief Shyam Gyawali and Crime Investigation Department Chief Tek Bahadur Tamang were also called for the discussion.As per a probe committee member, some committee members grilled IGP Kunwar about his previous statement in the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee. Speaking at the parliamentary committee in the last week of March, the Nepal Police chief had claimed that police had found no evidence of Home Minister Lamichhane’s involvement in cooperative fraud.“When I made the statement in the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee about the home minister, his involvement in the scam had not been disclosed,” a committee member quoted IGP Kunwar as saying at the special committee meeting. Another member of the probe committee, Shishir Khanal, said the IGP said he was not under any pressure to give a statement about Home Minister Lamichhane. Khanal is a lawmaker from the Lamichhane-led Rastriya Swatantra Party.“The IGP said that he spoke on the basis of facts and that no information regarding Home Minister Lamichhane’s involvement in the cooperatives scam had been found till the day he made the statement.”Also, the committee held discussions with chiefs and representatives of various panels formed since 1990 to probe irregularities in the cooperative sector.The parliamentary special panel will make recommendations on safeguarding depositors’ savings, and quick and easy refunds for victims whose deposits have been embezzled.The panel also agreed to probe crisis-ridden cooperatives and fast-track the refund process for the depositors of the cooperatives concerned.The parliamentary special probe committee began its work a month ago after a month-long discussion with top officials from government agencies as well as chiefs and members of various panels formed so far by the government to look into problems involving cooperatives. \nPrime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal has said that CPN-UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli had hatched a conspiracy against him and the government and joined hands with the Nepali Congress to form a new coalition by dismantling the UML-Maoist Centre alliance prematurely.The four-month-long partnership between Dahal and Oli collapsed after the UML chief sealed a yet-to-be-disclosed seven-point agreement with Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba on the midnight of July 2. Speaking at a meeting of the Maoist Centre’s parliamentary committee on Wednesday, the embattled prime minister accused Oli of betraying him. After the UML recalled its ministers from the Dahal Cabinet and withdrew its support to the government, Dahal is seeking the vote of confidence in the House of Representatives on Friday.“Oli betrayed me for no reason,” said Dahal. “We came to know that the Nepali Congress and the UML were inching towards a political deal but Oli lied to me several times about it.”On the morning of July 2, Dahal and Oli had a three-hour-long conversation at his residence in Baluwatar but Oli did not tell him the truth about what he had agreed with Deuba. “If you are going to become the prime minister with the support of Nepali Congress, I will quit and help you,” Dahal shared with the party’s lawmakers about what he had told Oli. But Oli had flatly denied having reached an agreement with the Congress, according to Maoist leaders.Hitraj Pandey, the chief whip of the Maoist Centre, quoted Dahal as saying that Oli did not want to inform him about the deal with Deuba. According to Congress and UML leaders, Deuba, Oli and second rank leaders of both parties had met regularly for months ahead of the July 2 deal.After second-rank leaders worked out the fundamentals of the new political deal and power-sharing, Deuba and Oli gave it a final touch at midnight on July 2 at the residence of a businessman.Dahal and Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Rabi Lamichhane have been claiming that after the arrest of Bechan Jha in the fake Bhutanese refugee case, Deuba and Oli joined forces in order to protect some of their close aides and family members. According to Nepal Police officials, Jha, who claimed to be an influential power broker, had established good connections with top Congress and UML leaders. Citing their initial findings of interrogation with other suspects they had arrested, police said individuals had given millions of rupees to Jha to facilitate their travel to the United States on the guise of Bhutanese refugees. Some of the accused who masterminded the fake Bhutanese refugee scam are in police custody. Jha’s arrest made the Congress and UML leaders fearful of being arrested, said the Maoist and Swatantra Party leaders. Briefing his party’s lawmakers, Dahal said that he then telephoned Deuba to know what exactly had happened between them. Deuba’s reply was that he and Oli had already reached a deal. He reportedly turned down Dahal's offer to lead the government, according to Pandey.But UML leaders, including their general secretary Shankar Pokhrel, Deputy General Secretary Pradeep Gyawali and others, claimed that after Dahal returned from New Delhi, he started negotiations for new government formation with Deuba and offered him the leadership of a national government.“After we came to know that the prime minister was hatching a conspiracy and going to destabilise the country's politics by changing the ruling partners, we decided to initiate talks with the Congress for the sake of forming a stable government, giving people hope and amending some constitutional provisions,” UMl leaders said. Dahal returned from New Delhi on June 10 after attending the swearing-in ceremony of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Dahal is seeking a vote of confidence on Friday. On Wednesday, the Nagarik Unmukti Party also decided to withdraw the support extended to the Dahal government. The government has already been reduced to a minority after the UML pulled the plug on it last week.“We will talk to all political parties and seek their support,” said Pandey, the Maoist Centre chief whip. The prime minister will mull his resignation only after the vote of trust in the House, said Pandey. Dahal, who was elected prime minister as per Article 76 (2) of the constitution, claims that the next government will be formed as per Article 76 (3) of the constitution. If the President upholds the spirit of the constitution, he should call for new government formation as per Article 76 (3), Pandey said. \nFormer prime minister and CPN-UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli, who is set to become prime minister next week, defended his seven-point deal with Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba. However, Oli said that the intricacies of constitutional amendments, which the two largest parties have reportedly agreed to in principle, have yet to be finalised.Speaking at a meeting of the party’s secretariat on Wednesday, Oli said that the two parties have agreed to the need to amend the constitution to protect national interests, make Nepal prosperous and the Nepalis happy, but the details have not been worked out.Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is set to go for a floor test on Friday after the UML and some other coalition partners withdrew their support to the government. As per the agreement reached between Deuba and Oli on July 2, the UML chair will become the prime minister early next week.Giving reasons why the first and second largest parties in the House of Representatives had come together for government formation, Oli stated that the current tendencies to allow private and partisan interests to dominate state affairs, and fringe parties with few lawmakers claiming the post of chief minister and their unusual manoeuvrings needed to be defeated by the partnership of the two parties.Deuba has already endorsed Oli as the next prime minister. The two parties will have a more or less equal number of Cabinet ministers, though they have yet to enter into the power-sharing deal.“Some are trying to create an illusion about the agreements signed between the Nepali Congress and the UML. Some were trying to pay their lip service to amending the constitution, but they actually engaged in making the constitution a failure. In due course of time some constitutional provisions should be revisited, so we have stressed the need for amendments,” said Oli.After the meeting, UML deputy general secretary Pradeep Gyawali said the statements made by Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane were not true. After the government decided to open more cases of corruption targeting top leaders of the Congress and the UML, the two parties came together overnight to topple the government, Dahal and Lamichhane have said publicly.But that is merely a political stunt, said Gyawali. Who stopped them from opening corruption cases in the last four months?“Prachanda ji had been in the government for 10 months [until he pushed the Congress out of the coalition], but what stopped him from opening the corruption cases? Rabi ji became the minister for six months over two terms. What stopped him from investigating the cases?” Gyawali asked. “These are only stunts. After failing to run the country and the government [effectively], they need some excuse which they are making. They kept saying this in the past week.”There is a large section, including the CPN (Maoist Centre) and others, that has critically taken the issue of charter amendment. But we have not discussed which constitutional provisions will go for the changes, he said. Those constitutional reforms will be based on the experience of a decade. The constitution was promulgated in September 2015. The agreement between the Congress and UML to amend it has made the political fraternity and activists and observers curious.No agreement has been reached on who will lead the commission that will suggest amending and reforming the constitutional provisions, he added.“Some are trying to create an illusion after the Nepali Congress and the UML came up with a deal. They are also saying that the agreement has taken the constitution towards anarchy, political instability and confusion. We see the governments in provinces are changing frequently or every month. Private and partisan interests dominated, instability and bargaining were rampant, and parties frequently changed the camps,” Oli shared his observation. “Development activities, necessities and requirements of the people had never been at the centre, but corruption and instability were dominated and rampant. So, how can we stop such a tendency? That is why we, the Nepali Congress and the UML, came together,” said Oli.Any attempt to fail the constitution, and weaken federalism is not accepted, he said the constitution is the dynamic document; it should guide society so the constitution should be amended as per the context of the time. Oli is all set to become the prime minister by early next week, but the Nepali Congress and UML have not settled the power-sharing deal, including the division of the ministerial portfolio, according to Oli.Oli said the power-sharing deal will be concrete only after the new government takes shape. “We will try to bring more parties into the government. We are in discussion with them. In general, the allocation of the ministries will be made as per the strength of the political party,” he added.The division of ministerial portfolios will be decided only after Friday or after Prime Minister Dahal fails to get the vote of confidence in the House of Representatives.The UML has issued a whip to all its lawmakers to vote against Dahal on Friday.Oli told the party meeting that smaller parties are also likely to join his government, according to one UML leader. There was a general understanding between the Congress and the UML of dividing 19 ministries between them.From the UML, Bishnu Poudel will be in the government as the finance minister. But there is no decision in the Congress on who will lead the party’s ministers in the Oli cabinet. It could be the party general secretary Gagan Thapa or one among senior leaders like Krishna Prasad Sitaula and Prakash Man Singh. Deuba wants Ramesh Lekhak to serve as the home minister, a leader close to the party president said.Oli is in a mood to form a governing team of both experienced and new faces, UML leaders said. Choosing ministers is more difficult for Deuba due to multiple power centres in the party led by Thapa, Sitaula, Singh and Shekhar Koirala. There is also the need to balance gender, region, and ethnic clusters in the party’s picks.The Congress has already endorsed the two-party deal. Oli is tipped to lead a ‘national consensus government’ for a year and a half, before handing the reins over to Deuba who will lead the administration until the general elections in 2027.Deuba and Oli have also agreed to review the electoral system, proportional representation, the composition of the National Assembly, and the size of provincial assemblies. The Congress and the UML will lead three provincial governments each, leaving the provincial government in Madhesh that is led by CK Raut’s Janamat Party. \nA new ‘political deal’ sealed between Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba and Chairman of the CPN-UML KP Oli at midnight on July 2 at the residence of a businessperson has been kept secret, sparking curiosity about its content and authenticity.While leaders of the Nepali Congress and the UML have disclosed most details of the deal, the original document has yet to be released, which has raised questions.Other parties in the House of Representatives have also shown an interest in seeing the original document.But the Congress and UML leaders have said that there is no reason to hide or keep secret the deal signed by the two party leaders, but the signatories may be looking for an appropriate time.“I don’t see any technical reason to keep the deal under wraps,” said Pradeep Gyawali, deputy secretary general of the UML. “Various stakeholders may be curious about it, but it will eventually be disclosed, at the right time.” Oli had informed his party leaders at a meeting that he had struck a seven-point deal with Deuba. “Most of the content of the deal is already out. There is nothing new to add,” said Gyawali. UML General Secretary Shankar Pokhrel and Congress leaders Ramesh Lekhak, Arzu Rana and Gyanendra Bahadur Karki were involved in finalising the agreement.Lawmakers from the CPN (Maoist Centre) and the Rastriya Swatantra Party, among others, have been demanding a copy of the deal and urging the Congress and the UML to produce it in Parliament as the deal involves serious issues like amending the constitution. But the leaders of the two parties have remained silent, again asserting that the deal will be disclosed at an appropriate time.On Saturday, a parliamentary party meeting of the Nepali Congress gave some clues of the said deal between Deuba and Oli.The meeting affirmed that a new national government will be formed in accordance with Article 76 (2) of the constitution as per the spirit of the agreement reached between the two largest parties last Monday. The meeting also endorsed the deal.As per the understanding between the Congress and the UML, Oli will lead a new ‘national consensus government’ for a year and a half. For the remaining term, Deuba will be the prime minister.Deuba and Oli also agreed on power-sharing and proposed constitutional amendments including a review of the electoral system, proportional representation, changes to the composition of the National Assembly, and discussion on the size of provincial assemblies.Min Bishwakarma, head of the Nepali Congress publicity department, said the seven-point deal will be made public in the House of Representatives and he called for the formation of a new government based on the national consensus.Before the formation of a new government under Oli’s leadership, incumbent Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who has already lost the majority support and now serves in a caretaker capacity, will face a floor test on Friday.He will certainly fail to get the majority vote, paving the way for President Ram Chandra Poudel to start the process for the formation of a new government.In the 275-strong House of Representatives, Dahal needs the support of 138 lawmakers to win the trust vote, but he currently has the backing of only 73 lawmakers—32 from the CPN (Maoist Centre), 21 from the Rastriya Swatantra Party and 10 from the CPN (Unified Socialist). The Janamat Party, with six members, and the Nagarik Unmukti Party, with four lawmakers, also support him.As per an initial power-sharing deal, the Congress will lead 10 ministries, including home, and the UML nine, including finance. Likewise, the Congress and the UML will lead three provincial governments each, with the government in Madhesh to be led by the CK Raut-led Janamat Party.The deal will be tabled in the House of Representatives, said Ram Hari Khatiwada, a Nepali Congress lawmaker. \nMukul Dhakal, the Rastriya Swatantra Party general secretary and its spokesperson, had voiced his fears before he submitted a review report to party president Rabi Lamichhane. “I could be removed from the party positions once I submitted the review report to the party chair,” Dhakal had said on June 26.Even before Dhakal handed in the review report, which he had prepared after visiting 38 districts in the wake of the April by-elections, its major findings were already out in the media. This hadn’t sat well with the party’s top brass and Dhakal’s prophecy came true within two weeks. On Tuesday, the party’s central committee relieved Dhakal of all his party duties. Dhakal is the party’s founding general secretary, spokesperson, and central committee member.“The party’s central committee meeting has taken the decision to expel Dhakal from all official posts,” Manish Jha, the party’s acting spokesperson, told the Post. “In view of his contribution to the party since its establishment, the central committee has decided to relieve him of his official positions only. He will continue to be a party member.”Jha said the move comes after the party’s disciplinary commission sought action against Dhakal a week ago, accusing him of incompetence and indiscipline, indecent and chaotic conduct, and violating party rules.“He is not being punished for what he wrote in the field report, but for his misconduct,” Jha added.Soon after the RSP expelled him from party positions, Dhakal took to social media and said he was expelled from the “Rabi Lamichhane club,” but “the bell will not stop ringing” within the party.Bell is the election symbol of the RSP, which now has 21 seats in the House of Representatives. For a party formed just a few months before the November 2022 election, the RSP became the fourth largest in the House, surprising analysts, who said that the party had ridden the back of its leader Lamichhane’s flamboyant personality and anti-establishment politics. The party later joined a coalition government, thereby assimilating with the very forces that it rose to power criticising.“The determination to turn Rabi Lamichhane’s party into the Rastriya Swatantra Party won’t be stopped, the bell won’t stop ringing,” Dhakal wrote, referring to the party chair’s cult of personality.Dhakal was suspended from the position of general secretary and party spokesperson for a week on July 3 over the same concerns.Soon after the RSP faced a sobering loss in the Ilam by-election in April this year, the party’s secretariat meeting on May 3 decided to conduct a cross-country review tour under a Dhakal-led team.Dhakal commenced the journey on May 19 with the objective of identifying the party’s strengths and weaknesses in relation to its policies, decisions, and organisational structure.In his political document, prepared after a review tour of 38 districts, Dhakal claimed that the party was headed for a disaster if it did not rectify its mistake.The review report also criticised the arbitrary nature of the party’s operations, President Lamichhane, and urged making the party bigger than one that, critics say, is built around a single leader’s image, among other things.On July 3, the party’s central committee discussed Dhakal’s review report. While Dhakal demanded that the meeting be broadcast live on social media, the members unanimously rejected the idea, leaving Dhakal further miffed.Moreover, that same day, Dhakal publicly criticised Lamichhane in a social media post after the party chief did not allow him to present the proposal he prepared based on the review tour at the meeting.“During the party secretariat meeting yesterday [July 3], I was told to submit a proposal based on the review report,” Dhakal then said. “I had prepared the written proposal but the party president did not allow me to submit it today.”He had also said he was promised that he would be allowed to share his thoughts during the central committee meeting. “But the party president did not allow me to do so either,” Dhakal said.The central committee meeting termed the review report prepared by Dhakal an incomplete document.Meanwhile, Dhakal had accused party chief Lamichhane of always trying to shirk his responsibility, whatever position he held, before the party officially decided to suspend him from his party position on the demand of the disciplinary commission.Dhakal had said that when Lamichhane was the managing director of the Gorkha Media Network, he shifted the blame for all wrongdoings to Chairman GB Rai of the company that ran the now-shuttered Galaxy 4k television.“Now as the party chairman, he is blaming the general secretary for mistakes,” Dhakal had told journalists. “It seems his position never commits a mistake.”Jha, the acting spokesperson, said that while relieving Dhakal of his duties, the central committee considered all his wrongdoings against the party.“If he thinks that the central committee’s decision is incorrect, he has the right to complain about it in the party’s appeal committee,” Jha said.Meanwhile, in his social media post, Dhakal has vowed to talk about the issue further on Wednesday, after reiterating that “the bell will not stop ringing.” \nIn a bid to lessen the spread of the dengue virus during the ongoing monsoon season, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City has decided to continue the drive to destroy mosquito larvae and breeding grounds. Officials at the health department of the city office said on Friday that they have just completed a week-long drive in all 32 wards of the metropolis and plan to continue these efforts in the coming days as well.“Every Wednesday, our health volunteers will visit households and open spaces to destroy mosquito breeding grounds,” said Rishi Bhusal, epidemic prevention and control focal person at the metropolis. “Decisions on preventive measures including launching search and destroy drives will depend on the spread of virus and intensity of rainfall in the coming days.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vectors also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus, according to the World Health Organisation.According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,268 people from 72 districts have been infected with the dengue virus since January this year. Among the 72 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases: 141. Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and can be treated with paracetamol at home.Dengue symptoms include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes. Patients with these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and proper medical care can prevent death.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district. Since then, an increasing number of dengue infections have been reported from many districts, including major dengue outbreaks. Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Though the post-monsoon period is considered the dengue epidemic season, the deadly disease has already become endemic in Nepal, as outbreaks of the virus are reported every month, including in the winter months.Officials at the health department said that 654 health workers, including female community health volunteers, were deployed in the week-long campaign, which concluded on Friday.“Volunteers and health workers who were deployed to the door-to-door campaign checked the mosquito breeding grounds and the larvae, made people aware about the risks and destroyed the breeding grounds,” said Bhusal. Health workers reported that storage places for scrap materials, discarded cups, and plastic in open spaces, and unused lands as potential hotspots for the dengue virus in the coming days. Health workers have warned owners of these sites that action will be taken if mosquito larvae are found against the owner of the storage place if mosquito larvae were found.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects, such as plastic cups and bottles, could be breeding grounds for these mosquitoes.Public health experts say now is the right time to prepare for and prevent possible outbreaks. Health ministry officials said they have alerted all related agencies to the risk of a dengue outbreak. \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City has imparted mental health screening training to doctors and paramedics serving at urban health promotion centres.Officials at the Health Department in the metropolis hope that the move will help hundreds of patients with mental health issues in the city to get timely treatment.“Getting free treatment for mental health problems comes under the right to get free basic health care services,” said Sajina Maharjan, acting head of the department. “Mental health problem screening training to doctors and paramedics will help in the timely diagnosis of the problems and start of early treatment.”At least 32 doctors serving at the urban health promotion centres under the city office and dozens of paramedics participated in five-day screening training. The metropolis has upgraded its urban health clinics to urban health promotion centres and started providing services through medical doctors. “Due to the lack of doctors at our urban health promotion centres, patients suffering from mental health problems have been deprived of timely treatment,” said Nali Bajracharya, a senior public health officer at the department. “Now patients having mental health issues and seeking care at our health centres will also get mental health treatment.”Though neither the federal government agency nor the city office has data on the number of people suffering from mental health problems in the metropolis, doctors estimated that a lot of people could be suffering from various forms of mental health problems—anxiety, depression and others.Officials say that they are also planning to provide free medication to patients with mental health problems.Health workers say that many city dwellers, despite having mental health problems, do not seek treatment and instead turn to drugs and substances to cope. Due to the entrenched social stigma, fear of discrimination and other factors, many patients in Nepal do not talk about their mental health issues.The general tendency among people to conceal mental health issues due to the stigma attached to it has also forced patients to opt for substance abuse, doctors say.They say that while drugs and alcohol may provide temporary relief from stress, they are not a solution and can adversely affect mental health and well-being in the long run.“Treatment in the initial stage of mental illness helps patients achieve better results. For that, early diagnosis is crucial,” said Dr Pomawati Thapa, chief of the Non-communicable Disease and Mental Health Section at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Other local units should also follow the initiative to provide mental health screening training to health workers, including doctors.”Nepal is among the countries with highest rates of suicide, which is an extreme manifestation of a mental health problem.According to Nepal Police data, 6,993 people took their own lives in the fiscal year 2022-2023. This accounts for more than 19 deaths on average daily. Fifty-six percent of those who die by suicide are men.Doctors say that people do not attempt suicide for a single reason, but due to a complex situation arising from multiple problems.An increasing number of people are struggling with mental problems owing to the rising cost of living and the struggle to manage even their most basic needs, such as food, housing, healthcare and jobs, experts say.Whatever the cause, suicides and suicide attempts have a ripple effect, impacting families, friends, colleagues, communities and societies, doctors say.A study carried out by the Nepal Health Research Council in the past shows that about 13 percent of Nepalis suffer from some form of mental disorder. This means around one in eight Nepalis has mental health issues. Moreover, the country simply does not have enough experts to treat mental health problems, it added.Studies show the magnitude of suffering, the burden and costs for individuals, families and societies arising from mental health disorders are alarming in Nepal.“No doubt, mental health problems have been emerging as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in our country,” said Thapa. “All local governments must take initiative to address the problems. Only the federal government agencies cannot do much.”The World Health Organisation says that one in four people in the world has been affected by mental or neurological disorders at some point in their lives, and around 450 million people currently suffer from such conditions, placing mental disorders among the leading causes of ill health and disability worldwide. \nDuring the 2022 local level election, people of Kathmandu elected independent candidate Balendra Shah as their mayor for five years. Sunita Dangol of the CPN-UML secured the position of KMC deputy mayor in the same election. When they began their term, many suspected that the two—an independent mayor and his party-affiliated deputy—wouldn’t have cordial relations. But, in the last two years of their term, there has been no visible disagreement between them. They proved their sceptics wrong.Deputy Mayor Dangol kept mum when Mayor Shah accused her party chair, KP Sharma Oli, of policy corruption in the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate land scam.Moreover, Shah expressed his anger on June 3 over the government’s intervention in his plan to widen pavements in the New Road area. Deputy Prime Minister Raghubir Mahaseth of the UML leads the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, which maintains major roads.After the ministry intervened in the municipal plan to expand the sidewalk on New Road, Shah took to social media and wrote, “Honourable KP Oli jyu, don’t hoodwink people by engineering yet another scam to hide a scam of Rs10,000 crore [Rs100 billion].”He further added, “You have reassured those who had made advance payments to buy land of Giri Bandhu Tea Estate that they would get the land within two years.” “If one looks at the policy corruption in the tea estate, it appears not a single leaf would stir without Oli’s nod,” Shah wrote.A few days prior to the incident, Mayor Shah had engaged in a heated debate with Chinkaji Maharjan, a UML member and chairman of KMC’s ward 22, over the sidewalk expansion plan.Dangol remained quiet on the issue thus far. However, at the city council meeting on Monday, which also discussed KMC's policies and programmes for the fiscal year 2024-25, she criticised Mayor Shah for his remarks.“This should be the first time the deputy mayor opposed the public behavior and statement of the mayor,” a Kathmandu ward chairperson told the Post on the condition of anonymity.Dangol had her initial plan to contest the mayor position independently but the UML gave her the deputy mayor’s ticket.Speaking during the Monday discussion, Deputy Mayor Dangol said, addressing Mayor Shah, “Your and mine voices are being heard and watched by Nepalis worldwide. Therefore, those of us who want to come to politics should think about our expression,” Dangol remarked. “We should maintain the image and dignity of the institution we represent.”She also emphasised the need to accommodate the voices of everyone in an undertaking.Though the representatives of Kathmandu Metropolitan City claim that Dangol's Monday statement was unusual, they deny any rift between the two leaders of the local government. “City council’s is an internal meeting of the KMC where various issues arise. We settle those issues internally,” Nabin Manandhar, the KMC spokesperson and ward 17 chairman from the Nepali Congress, told the Post. “Having an opinion does not necessarily mean criticism.”Rajesh Kumar Shrestha, chair of KMC ward 19, seconded Manandhar.However, local representatives of Kathmandu have been questioning Shah for his ‘lone-wolf’ manner of leading the institution.“We should develop a working relationship that welcomes everyone’s spirit,” Dangol told the council meeting. “If one thinks they are in a position and everything should be done as they say, it will only lead to trouble.”She added, “While working in a team, we definitely have a different opinion, but different opinions should be respected.”At the meeting, referring to Mayor Shah's past statements, council member Anita Karki asked him, saying, “What if the voters of Kathmandu set ablaze the Durbar where the KMC office lies?”In September last year, when the traffic police obstructed a KMC vehicle, later known to be used by his postpartum wife, Mayor Shah provocatively wrote on Facebook, threatening to burn Singha Durbar, the federal government’s central secretariat.Traffic police, under the federal government, had stopped the vehicle to check necessary documents on a Saturday.After the incident, Shah wrote on social media warning that if the government blocked KMC's vehicles again, he would set fire to Singha Durbar.Dangol said on Monday that she believed it was wrong to write on social media or make a statement inciting people to burn the Singha Durbar or the Bagh Durbar, where the KMC office is situated.Dangol, speaking at the city council meeting, also said there should be no polarisation between the representatives who were elected to develop Kathmandu. \nA police officer was found dead on the premises of the federal parliament building in Baneshwar, Kathmandu on Wednesday.According to Ekram Giri, spokesperson for the federal parliament secretariat, Ajit Gole of Dolakha committed suicide by shooting himself.The body of the victim was recovered from the parliament building’s washroom.Dinesh Mainali, spokesperson for the Kathmandu Metro Police Range, said Gole, who was on duty from 6am to 10am, was found dead at around 8 in the morning. “A constable of Nepal Police was found dead inside a toilet of the parliament building,” Mainali told the Post. “Preliminary investigation shows he was inflicted with a gunshot.”Nepal police said the investigation is underway. \nPolice on Friday arrested two people from Thimi of Bhaktapur for allegedly mining cryptocurrency.The Central Investigation Bureau took 50-year-old Biswas Gurung and Rajendra Tahamata, 25, into custody in connection with the crime, said Hobindra Bogati, spokesperson for the bureau.The duo allegedly ran mining operations from the CTEVT’s information technology lab using a server and 64 desktops, on which blockchain applications were found during a preliminary investigation. Further investigation into the matter is underway. \nKot Ghar, once considered the seat of powerful Malla kings of Galkot, a pretty kingdom in the confederation of 24 states known as Chaubisi Rajya, has been restored and preserved to draw tourists.The Kot Ghar means a house where weapons are placed or stored. The town of Galkot once served as the fortress of the hilly kingdom ruled by the Mallas. The historical palace, which has been renovated, offers a reason to visit Galkot.Before the Panchayat era, Galkot served as Baglung's headquarters. Without the administrative offices, the locals seek to make Galkot the tourism headquarters of Baglung.According to history, Jitari Malla, the elder son of King Narayan Malla of Parbat, established Galkot Rajya in 1631 BS.A stone inscription states that Kot Ghar was constructed in 1661 BS. Galkot was free until Jagat Pratap Malla's rule in 1844 BS. The local government has been trying to preserve the historical artefacts to showcase to the visitors. The ancient palace of Galkot was in dire straits because of the lack of conservation.The Shreemeher Gana barracks of the Nepal Army and Galkot municipality have jointly renovated the almost-collapsed Kot Ghar.Professor Din Bahadur Thapa, a historian, said that the state also produced rice during the 10th generation of kings 213 years ago. After that, until 2015 BS, the kings of Galkot remained rulers. After the last king, Bharat Bam Malla, was elected to parliament in the 2015 BS general election, Raja Rajouta stepped down. There is a history of Bharat Bam submitting a proposal to remove Raja Rajauta from the House of Representatives.Thapa's research mentions that the state of Galkot extended to Kathekhola in the east, Pandavakhani in the west, Rum in Myagdi in the north, and Musikot in Gulmi in the south. After the kingdom was taken away, Jagat Pratap Bam Malla moved the palace to Shraddhakhet. The last king, Bharat Bam, built a palace in Harichor Bazar in 1990 BS. The construction started in 1978 BS.Even until 2019 BS, the central administrative units of Baglung were in Galkot. Later, they were shifted to Baglung Bazaar. The Kot Ghar conservation and tourism promotion programme was started five years ago to reflect this legacy. Bir Jung Bhandari, former ward chairman of Galkot Municipality, had started some of the works.Bharat Sharma Gaire, mayor of the municipality, said that the historic city planning and the work to preserve the history had been completed with the help of the Nepal Army.Cannoning infrastructure has also been built at Sahasradhara waterfall near Kot Ghar. Festivals are organised during the Dashain and Chaite Dashain. Hundreds of pilgrims tour these religious sites annually.Locals conduct regular worship. A hundred houses in Kotmaidan village offer worship by taking ownership. It is listed in the city pride project.The weapons in Kot Ghar have been kept separately by making a new home. The doors and windows of Kot Ghar have been modelled on the Bhaktapur craft. On the way to Kot Ghar, a barbed wire fence and railing have been set up.Drainage and culverts have been constructed in some road stretches that reach Kot Ghar from the mid-hill highway. The municipality has been investing yearly to pave the road to Kot Ghar. The location is important from the tourism perspective.Galkot Valley, Ghumte hill, Daram River, and Tara River can be viewed from Kot Ghar. Kalika temple, near Kot Ghar, has also been maintained.Nearly 100 ropanies have been protected through barbed wire fences. The number of tourists visiting Kot Ghar has recently increased with the construction of drinking water taps and resting areas.The association of the former army conducted a district-level annual general meeting in the Kot Ghar area.It is presumed that the state was named Galkot, derived from ‘Golo Kot’, the way the Kot Ghar was built.Kot Ghar, located in Galkot Municipality-3, was the first seat of the kings. Though the king shifted to Harichaur through Shraddakhet, the weapons were kept in Kot Ghar and Kalika temple. Other structures were also built around Kot Ghar. Gaire said the places of historical importance were protected. A six-kilometre road has been built from the mid-hill highway to Kot Ghar.The road to Kot Ghar from the highway was maintained and paved, said Pham Bahadur Khatri, the ward chairman. He said that around Rs1.5 million was spent to renovate Kot Ghar, and the Nepal Army provided Rs900,000 and the human resources. \nThe government last week raised the minimum support price for paddy by more than 6.5 percent for the harvest of the next fiscal year, 2023-24, soon after the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led administration was reduced to a minority.This was the second time the government fixed the minimum support price during the paddy transplantation period. The Ministry of Commerce and Supplies tabled the proposal to increase the price, which was approved by the Cabinet meeting on July 4.The government decided to increase the minimum support price of common paddy to Rs3,580.62 per quintal (Rs35.80 per kg), up 6.50 percent. Similarly, the floor price for ‘mota dhan’ has been increased to Rs3,410.51 per quintal (Rs34.10 per kg), up 6.64 percent.The minimum support price is the lowest legal price that farmers receive for their harvests. The government does not fix the floor price of fine paddy.A minimum support price is an intervention by the government to protect farmers against sudden slumps in market prices. It is the rate at which the government buys farm produce when no other buyers are in the market.Usually, it is announced in time for farmers to make their production plans before the beginning of the planting season. Under the scheme, the government has to buy a certain amount of the total paddy harvest.In 2012, the government announced the resumption of the policy of fixing the minimum price following complaints that middlemen had been determining the market rate.Until 1999, the minimum support price for paddy and wheat would be announced regularly.According to reports, the practice was fully abandoned that year after the government launched the 20-year Agriculture Perspective Plan.Even when the minimum support price was announced, it was irrelevant as it was set well below the projected market price to protect the government from having to buy farm products should prices tumble.Moreover, reports said that even when support prices were announced, it was not done in time.The policy was irregular.In 2016-17, the minimum support price was announced in mid-November. In 2017-2018, the Cabinet sent back the supplies ministry's proposal. In 2021-22, the government announced the minimum support price for paddy on November 3, which is harvest time. The price was raised by 8 percent.On different occasions, members of parliamentary committees have criticised the government policy as ‘absurd’ because it was announced after many farmers had already harvested and sold their crops. Lawmakers said that the minimum support price was supposed to encourage farmers to boost output, but the government-fixed floor price had ‘discouraged’ them instead.It was only since the last fiscal year that the government announced the price before the transplantation season started.Paddy is transplanted in June and harvested by the end of October.This year, as of Sunday, paddy transplantation has been completed on 539,766 hectares as of Sunday, which is 38.6 percent of Nepal's 1.39 million hectares of paddy fields.Tilak Raj Chaulagain, a senior agro economist at the Department of Agriculture, said that the paddy transplantation rate was slightly lower (by 4 percent) compared to the same period last year. This year, the monsoon entered Nepal from the east on June 10, three days ahead of its usual onset date, according to the Meteorological Forecasting Division.Chaulagain said that the monsoon arrived on time, but it took time to be active. “As a result, transplantation was delayed slightly in the hills, but this will not affect production or productivity.\"According to Chaulagain, while transplantation on the hills is nearing completion, it will pick up pace in Tarai from mid-July. The Tarai, the largest paddy-producing region in the country, accounts for 71 percent of the total rice acreage. The hills account for 25 percent, and the mountain region for 4 percent.“Since there are no reports of a shortage of chemical fertilisers this year, we expect transplantation to be completed within a month and a half at this pace,” said Chaulagain.According to the department, Madhesh has the lowest translation rate of all provinces. In Madhesh province, which commands the lion’s share of the paddy fields, transplantation has been completed on 97,851 hectares, which is 25.5 percent of the 383,150 hectares available paddy fields in the province. Nepal’s economic well-being is closely tied to the rainy season. Rainwater is the lifeblood of Nepal's Rs5.70 trillion economy, which relies heavily on agriculture, with nearly two-thirds of the farmlands being rain-fed.During the four months of June to September, a large part of the country receives nearly 80 percent of its annual rainfall.The production of food grain, mainly rice, depends on the amount and distribution of monsoon rainfall over the country. The monsoon rains also replenish groundwater and reservoirs critical for drinking and power generation. \nIn a bid to support midwives and other healthcare personnel in ensuring safer births in low-resource settings, the Ministry of Health and Population has launched a “safe delivery app”.Officials hope that the mobile application will complement and enhance the ongoing capacity-building of health workers and help in reducing maternal and newborn deaths.“The Safe Delivery App provides up-to-date lifesaving procedures and practical guidance in the local language,” said Dr Bibek Kumar Lal, director of the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services, at the launch of the Nepali version of the Safe Delivery App. “It aims to improve the quality of emergency obstetric and newborn care, and the main users will be our frontline health workers, especially nurses and midwives.”Officials at the division said that the government has collaborated with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the Maternity Foundation (MF) to launch the Nepali version of the widely used digital health tool.Globally, every two minutes, a woman dies. In Nepal, two women die every day due to pregnancy-related complications—most of which are preventable, said Won Young Hong, a UNFPA representative in Nepal. “These are staggering numbers. UNFPA is pleased to work with the concerned stakeholders to localise this digital application so healthcare workers across Nepal can use it.”The Safe Delivery App is an evidence-based learning and training tool designed to support midwives, nurses, and other healthcare professionals to assist during births and to manage the most common complications. Among other features, it contains the latest clinical guidelines, animated instruction videos, descriptions of practical procedures, and action cards. It is free, and once downloaded on a smartphone or a tablet, it works offline, making it possible to be used even in the most remote areas. To date, more than 435,000 healthcare professionals across more than 70 countries have been reached through the Safe Delivery App and the accompanying programme worldwide, with Nepal being the latest country to introduce the App. “We will work with provincial governments and development partners to quickly roll out the App throughout Nepal,” said Lal.Nepal cut the maternal mortality rate from 539 per 100,000 births in 1996 to 239 per 100,000 births in 2016—for which the country even received a Millennium Award. According to the National Statistics Office report, the country has further reduced the number of deaths to 151 per 100,000 births in 2021. Maternal health experts, however, say that even if the country has made good progress in reducing maternal deaths, the current maternal mortality ratio is more than double the Sustainable Development Goals target, which is 70 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births by 2030.Neonatal deaths have not declined between 2016 and 2022, according to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022 carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population.The government’s target for the Sustainable Development Goals was to reduce neonatal mortality to 16 deaths per 1,000 live births by 2022 and 12 in every 1,000 live births by 2030.The SDGs, a follow-up on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), aim to end poverty, hunger, and all forms of inequality worldwide by 2030, and Nepal has committed to meeting the goals.The health ministry has been taking several measures to reduce maternal and neonatal deaths, including installing an underfloor heating system at birthing centres, setting up special newborn care units, training doctors, nurses, and paramedics in the district hospitals and distributing non-pneumatic anti-shock garments to prevent maternal deaths from excessive bleeding.Besides, the ministry provides free service and travel allowances for those opting for institutional delivery and antenatal visits. It also distributes misoprostol, a medication used to treat postpartum bleeding in new mothers, through female community health volunteers. \nAs heavy monsoon rains cause chaos across the country, dengue cases are surging in several districts, including Kathmandu.According to the Health Office Kathmandu, around 18 people are infected with the dengue virus every day. Officials, however, admit that this number could be just the tip of the iceberg, as the office gets reports only from 18 health facilities.“Yes, the number of people infected with the dengue virus could be several times higher than suggested by the reports we are getting every day,” said Dr Arjun Sapkota, chief of the Health Office, Kathmandu. “We are working to make daily reporting of dengue cases mandatory for private health facilities as well.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vectors also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus, according to the World Health Organisation.According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,432 people from 73 districts have been infected with the virus since January this year. Among the 73 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases with 159, followed by Jhapa with 120, Chitwan 83, Makawanpur 65, Tanahun and Doti 49 cases each, and Okhaldhunga and Sindhupalchowk 46 each.Sapkota informed that his office has sensitised the local bodies about the looming risk of a massive dengue outbreak in the coming days.“Mandatory reporting of dengue cases every day is among the preventive measures through which we can identify dengue hotspots,” said Sapkota. “This will help health workers target such measures in particular areas. Additionally, starting this week, we are resuming the “10 minutes at 10 am” initiative every Friday, during which mosquito breeding grounds will be destroyed.”Officials informed that several local units, including the Kathmandu Metropolitan City, have already started preventive measures against dengue. Dengue symptoms include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes. Patients with these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and proper medical care can prevent death.Doctors say many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and can be treated with paracetamol at home.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district. Since then, an increasing number of dengue infections, including major outbreaks, have been reported from many districts. Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Though the post-monsoon period is considered the dengue epidemic season, the deadly disease has already become endemic in Nepal, as outbreaks are reported every month, including in the winter months.According to health workers, storage places for scrap materials, discarded cups, plastic material tossed in open spaces, and unused lands will be potential hotspots for the dengue virus in the coming days. Health workers have warned the owners of these sites that action will be taken if mosquito larvae are found there.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects, such as plastic cups and bottles, could be breeding grounds for these mosquitoes. \nWith monsoon havoc sweeping across the country, the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division has urged health workers to avoid taking leave during the season.Officials have warned that health facilities could be overwhelmed by patients in the coming days as outbreaks of waterborne and vector-borne diseases are expected, as floodwaters have contaminated most of the drinking water sources.“We have requested the provincial and local health authorities not to grant leave to health workers during the monsoon season,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director of the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Health agencies have been cautioned about the looming risk of outbreaks of waterborne and vector-borne diseases in the coming days.”Torrential rainfall started Friday wreaking havoc in various places across the country. At least 14 people have died in disaster-related incidents—nine in landslides and five in floods—since Friday, according to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority. Officials said 18 others have been injured, and four people are missing. Since the monsoon entered the country on June 10, at least 43 people have died in landslides and flood-related incidents. Lightning strikes killed as many as 19 people during this period.The monsoon season in Nepal is a time of epidemics during which thousands of people across the country become infected with water-borne and vector-borne diseases.The persistent rainfall that started on Friday not only destroyed houses and inundated settlements but also contaminated drinking water sources.Health officials warned that health facilities could witness an uptick in the number of viral fever cases, and waterborne diseases—diarrhoea, dysentery, food poisoning, and snake bites—in the coming days.“We have also requested central hospitals and medical colleges to be prepared for help during disease outbreaks,” said Ghimire. “As we don’t have enough doctors and health workers to deploy to control the outbreaks, we have to seek help from big hospitals and medical colleges.”Officials at the Ministry of Health and Population said that they have been raising awareness through all available means to inform people of the risks. “Essential medicines have been stockpiled, health workers have been asked to be ready for deployment to affected areas, anti-snake venom has been supplied to health facilities,” said Dr Prakash Budhathoki, spokesperson at the Health Ministry. “As of Sunday evening, no outbreaks have been reported.”According to health experts, sources of drinking water generally become contaminated in disaster-hit areas, and people displaced by natural disasters become highly vulnerable to infections with waterborne and vector-borne diseases. Every year, thousands of people get infected with vector-borne diseases such as dengue, kala-azar, malaria, and scrub typhus during this period. Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts. According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,432 people from 73 districts have been infected with the dengue virus since January this year. Among the 73 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases: 159. Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. Likewise, snakebite incidents and resulting deaths are also common during the season, but the phenomenon, which experts dub “a lurking invisible crisis”, remains grossly neglected. “Incidents of snakebites have started to surge over the last few weeks,” said Dr Rajiv Jha, director at Provincial Health Directorate of Madhesh Province. “Along with the surge in waterborne and vector-borne diseases in the coming days, we have anticipated a rise in snakebite cases.”Doctors say the only ways to prevent deaths from waterborne diseases, including diarrhoea, are to raise awareness and ensure safe drinking water.They say a combination of careful surveys, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation and treatment are required to contain the spread of the diarrhoeal infection. \nWith the onset of the rainy season, the incidents of snakebite are on the rise in western Tarai districts.Snakebite treatment centres and hospitals in Kanchanpur and Kailali districts of Sudurpaschim province are now crowded with snakebite patients. Treatment of the snakebite patients, according to health workers, is quite challenging as patients are often brought to the health facilities at the last minute.As many as 60 snakebite patients visited the Snakebite Treatment Centre set up by Nepal Army at Arjuni of Shuklaphanta National Park within the past three weeks. “Over the past one week three to four snakebite patients have been visiting the centre on a daily basis,” said Ratan Bohora, a paramedic at the Arjuni-based Snakebite Treatment Centre. The local residents have hugely benefited after the Nepali Army and the local community jointly established the snakebite treatment centre at Arjuni in 2014. The centre, however, has to refer the patients with serious health conditions to other well facilitated hospitals due to the lack of an intensive care unit (ICU) and ventilator. “Two patients who were bitten by poisonous snakes were referred to Mahakali Provincial Hospital in Mahendranagar this year. We have no alternative but to send serious cases of snakebite to other hospitals due to the lack of the ICU and ventilator facilities,” said Bohora. The centre also does not even have a monitor to track a patient's vital signs such as blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen levels. The flow of the patients is increasing, but the centre only has two paramedics to provide treatment.Incidents of snakebite and resulting deaths are common in Nepal, but the issue still remains grossly neglected as what experts call a lurking ‘invisible crisis’. Each year, around 2,700 people, mostly children and women from Nepal’s Tarai region, die of snakebites, according to a March 2022 report.Most snakebite incidents occur when farmers are transplanting paddy fields or children are playing outdoors. Health workers say that the snakes that live in water are generally less poisonous. “The cases that are most serious occurred at night, often inside houses. Such patients should be taken to hospital immediately,” said Bohora. According to him, people living in thatched-roof houses are especially vulnerable to snakebite, because snakes often enter such homes in search of rats.Nepal is home to around 17 highly venomous snakes. Each year, the country sees about 20,000 to 40,000 cases of snakebite. The numbers could be higher, as many cases of snakebite go unreported, health workers say.Another health challenge in rural Nepal is the superstitious belief in visiting shamans instead of seeking treatment at medical facilities for snakebite. Experts say awareness drives should be launched to educate people that the snakebite patients should be taken to the hospital at the earliest. They recommend promoting cleanliness around homes, preventing children from playing in bushy areas, avoiding nightime walks, and using torchlight while walking in the dark.“Treatment of snakebite patients is possible if they are taken to health facilities on time. Patients are often brought to the hospital only after their condition has worsened, resulting in serious consequences,” said Dr Arjun Bhatta, medical superintendent at Mahakali Provincial Hospital. According to him, 10 snakebite patients with serious health conditions visited the hospital in the past three weeks. “They returned home after treatment,” said Bhatta. \nThe Thapathali-based Paropakar Maternity and Women’s Hospital is going to organise a healthy baby competition next month with an aim to raise awareness about overall baby development. Officials at the hospital said that the competition will not only assess physical growth and health of babies, several expert teams will also evaluate feeding practices, exclusive breastfeeding, immunisation, and the use of family planning methods by parents to ensure proper birth interval.“We would like to request parents of babies born at our hospital in the past year to register their babies for the contest,” said Dr Shree Prasad Adhikari, director at the hospital. “This is also an opportunity for parents to show how their parenting has been yielding positive results.”The hospital administration, however, said that the contest would be open only to babies born at the maternity hospital.Around 24,000 babies are born at the hospital each year, with around 39 percent delivered through the Caesarean section.The hospital administration said the contest will be held on August 13, coinciding with the hospital’s anniversary, and registration will start on July 16. Babies will be assessed in three categories—1 to 45 days, 45 days to six months, and six months to one year.Doctors say that babies' body mass index will be monitored to assess their growth.“We will also evaluate exclusive breastfeeding practices, administration of routine vaccines, and use of family planning methods,” said Adhikari. “We will form several teams of experts to assess the babies and award certificates to the top three babies in each category.”Doctors at the hospital said that the contest would help raise awareness of good parenting, exclusive breastfeeding, healthy feeding habits, the drawbacks of giving junk food to small children, and the importance of using family planning methods to maintain appropriate intervals between births.Studies show that the exclusive breastfeeding rate in Nepal has been steadily declining over the years. According to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022, exclusive breastfeeding has been continuously declining from 70 percent in 2011 to 56 percent in 2021.What concerns health officials is that more educated and well-off mothers are less likely to exclusively breastfeed their babies, as shown by studies.The report said the proportion of children who are bottle-fed rises with increasing education among mothers, ranging from 12 percent among mothers with no formal education to 49 percent among those with more than a secondary education. The use of a bottle with a nipple is the highest in the highest wealth quintile, at 46 percent, and lowest in the poorest quintile, at 11 percent.The proportion of children aged 0–5 months who are exclusively breastfed fluctuates across wealth quintiles. The proportion is highest in the lowest wealth quintile—64 percent—and lowest in the highest quintile—44 percent.The proportion of children who are bottle-fed is higher in urban areas, at 26 percent, than in rural areas, at 15 percent. The use of a bottle with a nipple is lowest in Karnali Province, at 11 percent, and in Madhesh Province, at 12 percent, and the highest in Bagmati Province, at 43 percent.The report also showed that bottle-feeding practices often start in health facilities. It showed that 22 percent of children born in a health facility receive mixed milk feeding (breast milk and fresh, packaged, or powdered animal milk or infant formula), as compared to 12 percent of those born at home. The World Health Organisation, however, does not recommend bottle feeding, stating that the nipple on a feeding bottle is susceptible to contamination and increases the risk of diseases among children.Nepal had committed to increasing the exclusive breastfeeding rate to more than 90 percent by 2030, but the rate declined from 70 percent in 2011 to 66 percent in 2016 and to 56 percent in 2022.The same report also shows that four percent of children received no vaccination between 2016 and 2021. Experts say feeding practices, exclusive breastfeeding, awareness about the importance of routine vaccination, and the use of family planning methods are basic things that determine not only the health of babies but also their future.  \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar. \nKhokana, a historic village near Lalitpur, showcases ancient architecture, mustard oil mills, and the Sikali Temple, offering a glimpse into the Kathmandu Valley's past while preserving a sense of community.\nA filmmaker embarks on a journey to Everest Base Camp to explore life's meaning and resilience, facing challenges, finding inspiration, and witnessing nature's wonders, ultimately embarking on a new chapter in their life.\nA group of journalists embarked on a five-day island-wide tour of Sri Lanka, visiting historical, religious, and natural landmarks while exploring the country's post-economic crisis tourism recovery and rich historical connections to ancient India and Nepal.\nFrom Mundhum Trek's breathtaking views to Janaki Mandir's rich history, Kuri Village's snowy vistas, Annapurna Base Camp's cultural immersion, Bardiya National Park's wildlife wonders, Khaptad National Park's serene beauty, and Limi Valley's remote charm, Nepal offers a diverse range of attractions.\nThe author revisits his hometown Phidim, finding it transformed with concrete buildings, paved roads, and increased urbanization, while grappling with the challenges of limited higher education and healthcare, resulting in an exodus of its people.\nEngland overcame late adversity to beat the Netherlands 2-1 and book a place in the Euro 2020 final, where they will face Spain on Sunday.\nColombia beat Uruguay 1-0 in their Copa America semi-final on Thursday despite being reduced to 10 men for 45 minutes to book a title decider against defending champions Argentina thanks to a first-half header from Jefferson Lerma.Uruguay’s Darwin Nunez missed several chances in the first half and Colombia made them pay when Lerma rose above the defence on a corner in the 39th minute and squeezed his header past goalkeeper Sergio Rochet.Colombia went down to 10 men just before halftime when Daniel Munoz lost his cool and got himself sent off, with the right back receiving a second yellow card for elbowing Manuel Ugarte in the chest when play was stopped.Uruguay dominated possession in the second half and veteran striker Luis Suarez nearly equalised when he hit the post but Colombia bravely held on for a famous win and will play Argentina in Sunday’s final.Uruguay will play Canada a day earlier in the third-place playoff. \nNepal national women’s cricket team suffered back-to-back defeat in their ACC Women’s T20 Asia Cup preparatory tour as they lost to Sri Lanka Development Squad by four wickets in their second practice match at Surrey Village Cricket Stadium in Maggona on Wednesday.Chasing 107 set by Nepal, Sri Lanka Development Squad overhauled the target in 19.5 overs losing six wickets.The hosts needed 20 runs from their last two overs, and Malki Madara played an explosive six-ball 16 to guide her side to victory.Senarathne and Imika Mendis had laid the foundation for the win with a 33-run opening stand. Senarathne scored 27 runs off 37 balls, while Mendis made 17 facing 21 deliveries.Sandeepani contributed 19 runs.Kritika Marasini, Kabita Joshi, captain Indu Barma and Sabnam Rai took a wicket apiece for Nepal.Earlier, Nepal opted to bat first after winning the toss and posted 106-7 from their 20 overs.Kabita Kunwar top-scored for Nepal with 29 runs off 34 balls.

Messi is second behind Cristiano Ronaldo, who has scored 130 goals for Portugal.Despite their two-goal cushion, Argentina had a nervy finish to the match as Canada substitute Tani Oluwaseyi tested Martinez with a crisp shot in the 89th minute before directing a glancing header wide a minute later.Argentina will take on either Uruguay or Colombia, who meet on Wednesday, in the final in Florida on Sunday. \nSpain struck twice in five minutes in a pulsating first half to secure a 2-1 comeback win over France on Tuesday as a record-breaking goal from teenager Lamine Yamal and a Dani Olmo effort propelled them into the Euro 2024 final.The 16-year-old Yamal cancelled out Randal Kolo Muani’s opener with a sublime shot in the 21st minute to become the youngest scorer in a Euro or World Cup before Olmo added another in the 25th for his third goal in the knockout stage.The Spaniards, who have won every game of the tournament so far, confirmed their favourites tag with another display of attacking football, especially in the first half, that is a far cry from the tiki-taka passing game that earned them world and European titles more than a decade ago.“I’m very happy to have made it to the final,” said man-of-the-match Yamal. “Now the most important thing is to win it. We were in a difficult moment, you wouldn’t expect a goal so soon.”“I wanted to put it in where it went in, and I’m very happy. I’m happy and content with the victory. I want to win, win and win,” added the teenager.They will now face the winners of Wednesday’s match between England and Netherlands in the final in Berlin on Sunday as they hunt a record-breaking fourth European crown.It was a anti-climactic end to France’s tournament, although the 2022 World Cup finalists never lived up to expectations in Germany with a very low conversion rate that carried into the semi-final.“Spain proved tonight that they are a very good team. We were fortunate to open the scoring, but they caused us problems because they were superior in terms of control,” said France coach Didier Deschamps.“Tonight they showed all their qualities. We were... perhaps a little less fresh, which led to some technical waste, particularly in the build-up of the game. We didn’t push forward often enough.”Spain had an early chance when Yamal, the youngest player to feature in a World Cup or Euro semi-final, floated a cross to the far post but Fabian Ruiz headed over the bar.FRANCE GOALFrance did better from an almost identical move in the ninth minute with Kylian Mbappe, playing without a mask after breaking his nose earlier in the tournament, crossing for Kolo Muani to head in their first goal from open play at Euro 2024.But the Spaniards, who were missing suspended Dani Carvajal and Robin Le Normand as well as injured Pedri, quickly turned the game around.Yamal curled a stunning left-footed effort from 25 metres in off the post to break another record held by Brazil great Pele, as the youngest scorer in a Euro or World Cup.Before France had any time to recover Olmo completed their lightning-quick comeback in the 25th with a shot that was deflected in by France’s Jules Kounde.France, who had only conceded one goal in their previous five games in the tournament, upped the tempo after the break and had chances through Mbappe and Theo Hernandez.But they could not carve out an equaliser with Spain, pulling back and successfully soaking up the pressure. \nResidents of Gaza City were trapped in houses and bodies lay uncollected in the streets under an intense new Israeli assault on Thursday, even as Washington pushed for a peace deal at talks in Egypt and Qatar.Hamas militants say a heavy Israeli assault on Gaza City this week could wreck efforts to finally end the war just as negotiations have entered the home stretch.Home to more than a quarter of Gaza’s residents before the war, Gaza City was destroyed during the first weeks of fighting last year, but hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have returned to homes in the ruins. They have now once again been ordered out by the Israeli military.The Gaza health ministry said it had reports of people trapped and others killed inside their houses in the Tel Al Hawa and Sabra districts of Gaza City, and rescuers could not reach them.The Civil Emergency Service said it estimated that at least 30 people had been killed in the Tel Al-Hawa and Rimal areas and it could not recover bodies from the streets there.Despite army instructions on Wednesday to residents of Gaza City that they can use two “safe routes” to head south, many residents refused to heed the order. Some posted a hashtag on social media: “We are not leaving”.“We will die but not leave to the south. We have tolerated starvation and bombs for nine months and we are ready to die as martyrs here,” said Mohammad Ali, 30, reached by text message.Ali, whose family has relocated several times within the city, said they had been running short of food, water and medicine.“The occupation bombs Gaza City as if the war was restarting. We hope there will be a ceasefire soon, but if not then is God’s will.”Withdrawal from ShejaiaJust east of Gaza City in the Shejaia suburb, residents were returning on foot to a desolate moonscape of destroyed buildings after Israeli forces withdrew following a two-week offensive there.The territory’s main cemetery had been bulldozed by the army. People wheeled supplies on the back of bicycles across rubble-strewn tracks, passing the remains of burnt-out and blasted Israeli armoured vehicles.“We have returned to Shejaia after 15 days. You can see the destruction. They spared nothing, even trees, there was a lot of greenery in this area. What is the guilt of stones and trees? And what is my guilt as a civilian?” resident Hatem Tayeh told Reuters in the ruins.“There are bodies of civilian people. What is the guilt of the civilian? Who are you fighting?”Israel launched its assault on the Gaza Strip last year after Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and capturing more than 250 hostages according to Israeli tallies.Since then, Israel’s assault has killed more than 38,000 according to medical authorities in Gaza.At the southern edge of the enclave in Rafah near the border with Egypt, where tanks have been operating in most of the city since May, residents said the army continued to blow up houses in the western and central areas, amid fighting with Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and other smaller factions.Palestinian health officials said four people were killed, including a child, in an Israeli air strike in Tel Al-Sultan in western Rafah.The Israeli military said earlier on Thursday around five rockets fired from the Rafah area were successfully intercepted.The negotiations in Qatar and Egypt follow important concessions last week from Hamas, which agreed that a truce could begin and some hostages released without Israel first agreeing to end the war.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who faces opposition within his right-wing cabinet to any deal that would halt the war until Hamas is vanquished, says a deal must allow Israel to resume fighting until it meets all its objectives.Two Hamas officials contacted by Reuters had no immediate comment on the content of the ongoing talks, led by Egypt, Qatar, and the United States.“There will be a meeting today between Hamas and the mediators to check on what responses they have received from the occupation,” said one Palestinian official close to the mediation, without elaboration. \nUS President Joe Biden told Britain’s new Prime Minister Keir Starmer that he welcomed his desire for closer ties with European counterparts, according to a UK government statement on Thursday.Starmer met Biden in the White House’s Oval Office on Wednesday where the two men discussed UK and US ties, the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza, and England’s soccer win in the semi-finals of Euro 2024.“The President welcomed the prime minister’s recent comments on establishing closer relationships with our European counterparts, as well as the UK’s commitment to AUKUS,” the British government said in a statement, referring to the security pact between Britain, the US and Australia.“They reflected that at a time when we face growing challenges across the world, we are at our strongest when we unite and work together.”Starmer was in Washington for the NATO summit, where he also met European leaders including Germany’s Olaf Scholz.Starmer has said he wants Britain to reset relations with the European Union to improve cooperation in areas such as security and trade, seeking to dampen the rancour that stemmed from Britain's 2016 referendum to leave the bloc.However he has ruled out any move to rejoin the European Union’s single market or customs union.The two leaders also agreed they must do whatever it takes to support Ukraine in its war with Russia, and discussed their joint desire for a ceasefire in Gaza to get hostages out, aid in and make progress towards a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. \nThe United States will start deploying longer range missiles in Germany in 2026, the two countries announced at a meeting of the NATO alliance on Tuesday, a major step aimed at countering what the allies say is a growing threat Russia poses to Europe.The decision will send Germany the most potent US weapons to be based on the European continent since the Cold War, in a clear warning to Russian President Vladimir Putin.A US-German statement said the “episodic deployments” were in preparation for longer-term stationing in Europe of capabilities that would include SM-6, Tomahawk and developmental hypersonic weapons with greater range.The move would have been banned under the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty signed by the US and the Soviet Union in 1987 but that collapsed in 2019.“We cannot discount the possibility of an attack against Allies’ sovereignty and territorial integrity,” the allies said in a communique released on Wednesday.More aid was headed to Ukraine as the allies bolster Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.A communique said the allies intend to provide Ukraine with at least 40 billion euros ($43.28 billion) in military aid within the next year, but stopped short of the multi-year commitment NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg had sought.The document also strengthened past NATO language on China, calling it a “decisive enabler” of Russia’s war effort in Ukraine and saying Beijing continues to pose systemic challenges to Euro-Atlantic security.Stoltenberg told reporters it was the first time the 32 allies had jointly labeled China a decisive enabler of Russia’s war and called it an important message.He said NATO was not an organization that imposes sanctions, but added: “At the end of the day, this will be for individual allies to make decisions, but I think the message we send from NATO from this summit is very clear.”The communique called on China to cease material and political support for Russia’s war effort and expressed concern about China’s space capabilities, referenced rapid expansion of its nuclear arsenal, and urged Beijing to engage in strategic risk reduction talks.NATO, “THE GREATEST ALLIANCE”Biden hosted NATO partners and allies at a dinner at the White House on Wednesday to celebrate what he called “the greatest alliance the world has ever known.”Biden said in a speech on Tuesday that NATO was “stronger than it’s ever been” and that Ukraine can and will stop Russian leader Putin “with our full, collective support.”On Wednesday, he said he was pleased all NATO members were pledging to expand their industrial bases and to develop plans for defense production at home.“We cannot allow the alliance to fall behind,” Biden said. “We can and will defend every inch of NATO territory and we'll do it together.”At the White House, Biden and new British Prime Minister Keir Starmer had a back-and-forth exchange and shared laughs and congratulations over England’s 2-1 win over the Netherlands in the Euro 2024 soccer tournament.Biden described the United Kingdom as the “knot” tying together the trans-Atlantic NATO alliance and said that the two countries must continue to cooperate.He also met at the summit venue with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada and Finland’s President Alexander Stubb of Finland to discuss strengthening their trilateral cooperation on economic issues and on defense industrial production.Biden, 81, has faced questions about his fitness for office after fumbling a June 27 debate and hopes the NATO spotlight will help him stage a comeback of sorts, surrounded by allied leaders he has spent his three years in office cultivating.However, November’s US presidential election could presage a sharp change in Washington’s support for Ukraine and NATO. Republican candidate Donald Trump, 78, has questioned the amount of aid given to Ukraine to fight Russia’s invasion and US support for allies generally. \nMukesh Ambani's son's wedding in Mumbai leads to traffic restrictions due to high-profile attendees, including celebrities and international dignitaries.\nNepal's book market is rife with unauthorized translations, with many popular foreign books being illegally translated without permission from authors or publishers, and without proper quality control.\nYouths from a former Maoist \"base area\" in Nepal have lost millions of rupees attempting illegal entry to the U.S. via traffickers, with eight deported and others still facing hardships and refugee cases.\nDespite government regulations requiring private hospitals to allocate 10% of beds for free treatment to the needy, many hospitals in Pokhara, Chitwan, Biratnagar, and Butwal blatantly ignore these mandates, depriving vulnerable patients of crucial services due to weak monitoring and lackadaisical enforcement by authorities.\nDespite his machinations to retain power, Prime Minister Dahal's alliance with Deuba and Oli led to his downfall, as evident in the appointment of the new government and the review of ineffective constitutional commissions, showcasing the unsteady nature of Nepal's politics.\nMasoud Pezeshkian, Iran's President-elect, plans discussions with foreign counterparts and may adopt policies impacting Afghan refugees after consulting with Ayatollah, but a dedicated Afghan refugee policy remains uncertain.\nThe 2015 Constitution marked a significant milestone in Nepal’s political history. Its formal implementation began with the election of the three levels of government—federal, provincial and local—in 2017. As Nepal enters a new phase of its political evolution, it is an opportune moment to consider necessary amendments to the constitution to strengthen federalism and democracy. The Post also published an editorial titled 'Easy does it' this Monday, highlighting the complexities involved in this process. The Nepali Congress and the Communist Party of Nepal (UML), the two major political parties, claim to have agreed to amend the constitution. If so, this is a positive step toward addressing critical governance issues. However, alliances and agreements between these major parties are precarious and prone to change, threatening political stability. There are talks of forming a national consensus government and amending the constitution, but the possibility and impact of such an endeavour remain questionable.Nine years after its promulgation, the constitution’s shortcomings and inconsistencies have become evident. A severe review of the constitution's implementation is necessary, and reforms and amendments must address these issues. The constitution should be seen as a dynamic and living document, not merely a source of problems. This approach emphasises continuous improvement to reflect the evolving political and social environment.A good constitution alone does not ensure good governance; it requires competent, sincere and committed leaders. The constitution issued by the Constituent Assembly is certainly an improvement over previous versions, but its implementation has been slow. Provincial and local governments have struggled to exercise the rights granted by the constitution. For instance, the constitution assigns provinces the exclusive right to exercise police powers, but this has not been allowed in practice.Frequent changes in power have caused dissatisfaction among citizens. While the United States has maintained the same federal constitution and governance system for over two centuries, Switzerland has had the same federal system for 176 years, Canada for 157 years, and India for 74 years. These countries have undergone repeated constitutional reforms to ensure stability. In contrast, Nepal has seen numerous changes in its governance system and constitution.Federalism is the cornerstone of Nepal's constitution. The issue lies not in the constitution itself but in its implementation by the rulers. Instead of addressing constitutional loopholes, leaders have exacerbated them. Reforms in the electoral system are essential to achieving stability and a better federal governance system. Nepal’s mixed electoral system has led to coalition governments. While some people lament that small parties play disproportional roles in the coalition culture, a coalition of diverse parties can also bring more comprehensive ideas and solutions for the country’s development. However, individual interests have often taken precedence over national interests, leading to a lack of collective accountability. Therefore, reform of the electoral system is inevitable.A significant debate revolves around whether to reduce the seats allocated for proportional representation in the House of Representatives. The proportional representation system was designed to ensure fair representation for women, Dalits and marginalised communities. Removing this system altogether, or even reducing its weightage, without addressing the underlying issues of representation, would be inappropriate and counterproductive. The fault lies not in the electoral system but in the political leadership that constantly changes alliances.Some politicians and analysts have proposed direct election of the Prime Minister and Chief Minister, which could lead to more stable governments. This change would require making parliamentary elections entirely proportional, ensuring that MPs focus on law-making and government oversight. They also propose reforming the structure of the provinces, as the current federal system does not appear to function effectively. Reducing the number of Members of Parliament (MPs) is necessary. The House of Representatives (HoR) currently has 275 seats, and the Provincial Assemblies together have 550 seats. The large size of the HoR and the provincial assemblies has resulted in huge expenses. The first-past-the-post (FPTP) voting system should ensure that everyone is directly elected, and the number of MPs should be adjusted accordingly. Reducing the number of MPs elected through the proportional electoral system—currently 110 in the HoR and 220 in the provincial assemblies—will also address the high costs associated with federalism. However, in the FPTP system, those elected via the proportional electoral system, such as women, Dalits and other marginalised communities, should be addressed with reserved constituencies. In such cases, elections should be held exclusively within these groups.The proportional electoral system is not inherently flawed. However, it has often benefited those with political connections or financial influence. To address this, proportional candidates should be elected based on joint votes from political parties and candidates, ensuring the people approve them. Amendments should include fixing the tenure of the Prime Minister, similar to the President and local level heads, who have two tenures. The PM should not serve more than two terms. Limiting MPs from becoming ministers can also reduce political corruption. Reducing the number of ministers is crucial; the current provision for up to 25 ministers is excessive. With the provincial and local levels taking more responsibilities, the number of ministries at the federal level should be reduced by half.Nepal's federal system must also streamline the number of departments and ministries. Many existing departments play insignificant roles and should be abolished or transferred to provinces. Stability at the provincial level is another critical issue. Frequent changes of Chief Ministers have led to public discontent. Direct elections for Chief Ministers can enhance accountability and stability. The constitution should be amended to allow the Vice President to become the Chairperson of the National Assembly. This will reduce additional expenses and enhance the role and effectiveness of the National Assembly.Amending the constitution requires a two-thirds majority in both houses of Parliament, which the Congress and the UML alone cannot achieve. Forming a national consensus government is necessary to garner the required support. However, significant contradictions among the parties on constitutional issues make it challenging to reach a consensus. These contradictions need to be addressed through dialogue and compromise to move forward effectively.The constitution outlines formal roles and duties and expects certain behaviour from political and institutional actors. Political parties, leadership, parliament, judiciary and constitutional bodies must establish actions aligned with the constitution's essence. Without this alignment, politics cannot gain people’s trust, and the Constitution becomes merely a tool for gaining power.Judicial reforms are also crucial for constitutional stability. The constitution must be amended to address these issues comprehensively. Disillusionment and mistrust towards political leadership and politics in general are prevalent. This sentiment stems from the opportunism of political leaders rather than the constitution and the system. We need a new generation of leaders who can feel the changing aspirations of society and maintain relevance in politics. Leadership should focus on long-term national interests rather than short-term personal gains.Nepal stands at a crossroads where constitutional amendments can pave the way for a more stable and prosperous future. The collaboration between major political parties and the lessons from international experiences underscore the importance of these reforms. By addressing the current challenges and ensuring proportional inclusive representation, Nepal can strengthen its federalism and democracy, fulfilling the aspirations of its people.Finally, amending the constitution alone will not solve the problems unless it is accompanied by a change in political culture and leaders’ attitudes and actions. Political stability and effectiveness depend on the commitment of political actors to uphold the principles of the constitution and work towards the common good. This holistic approach is essential for ensuring the constitution remains a robust and guiding document for the nation’s future. \nMonsoon-related disasters, epidemics (dengue, cholera, etc.), and water contamination have impacted Nepal in 2022, affecting healthcare resources and vulnerable populations.\nHeavy monsoon rains in Nepal since June 10th have caused floods and landslides, resulting in at least 70 deaths and widespread displacement, highlighting the vulnerability of the country to monsoon-related disasters.\nNepal's political leaders aim for a \"national consensus\" government by amending the constitution, despite needing a two-thirds majority they lack, sparking speculation about ulterior motives such as reducing proportional representation seats.\nTwo Nepali political giants, the Nepali Congress and CPN-UML, agreed to form a government under UML leader KP Sharma Oli and amend the constitution to enhance political stability.\nOver 52% of students failed to advance to grade 11 due to poor teacher quality, impractical grading system, inadequate preparation, and lack of resources in the new letter grading system implemented in SEE, leading to a debate about the test system.\nNepal's recent ambassadorial changes and the Prime Minister's India visit have raised questions about diplomatic decorum, ambassadorial selection, Nepal-India relations, and the progress of trade and BRI projects with China.\nThe government has decided to make the National ID Card mandatory in order to receive services from government and public institutions. In the first phase, the June 6 Cabinet meeting made the National ID card number mandatory in 28 districts. People including federal lawmakers criticised the decision saying that it was enforced without first distributing the cards. In this context, Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Yubaraj Katel, director general of the Department of National ID and Civil Registration.Let’s begin with a basic question. Why do we need a National ID card while we already have citizenship certificate, driving license, passport and voting card?There is a fundamental difference between a citizenship card and National ID. Citizenship establishes whether you are a citizen of the country and it helps you identify yourself with some basic details. In Nepal, it was also widely used as a service card. Wherever you go, you have to show the citizenship card—to open a bank account or acquire a SIM card for a phone. If we study international practices, there are mainly two cards—one is an identity card and the other is a service card. In 2018, the Nepal government came up with the idea of distributing national identity cards with a unique digital number for each eligible citizen. The number can track not only the individual but also the person’s activities and movements. This project has various components. First is data collection. It has two categories—demographic data, such as the names of father, mother and other family members. Second is biometric data—fingerprints, eye retina and digital signature. The biometric data is crucial to create a unique identity of each individual and avoid duplication in the integrated national database. The National ID has these two types of data. The other tasks are enrollment of the data, printing and distribution of the cards and then providing services based on that. At present, people carry multiple cards in their pockets. The objective of this project is to replace all of them by a single card–National ID. The new card includes vital details of all other cards in its chip with 1GB storage capacity. The government wanted to trace people based on their unique individual numbers so that there is no need to print and carry multiple cards. There is a huge industry of printing separate cards for each and every service that is creating a jumble of information. The National ID will not only replace multiple cards but also help authorities control criminal activities like financial frauds by removing duplication. At present, government authorities have difficulty in tracing and identifying an individual and wrongdoers are benefitting from that situation.What cards will be replaced by the National ID?It has a chip with 1GB storage capacity where you can store your driving license, academic documents, voting card, insurance details, ATM card number, etc. For instance, if you go to a telecom company to acquire a SIM card, they will ask for a copy of your citizenship card. You can say, ‘no, I have a National ID card’. Once you give your number and fingerprint, they can immediately verify it through the system. Another objective is to help people get rid of filling up pages of forms for each service. International governance has a norm that says don’t ask citizens their information more than once. A state agency should seek the information once and provide it to other state agencies if they require it. People complain that many agencies don’t accept National ID. They still ask for a citizenship card for official record and verification. So, in practice, it didn’t help people reduce the number of cards in their pockets. In fact, it added one more.Therefore, the June 6 Cabinet decision made the use of National ID cards compulsory in 28 districts. Now, it is going to be essential to get social security allowances, pensions and claim health insurance. The Health Insurance Board has said it has become challenging for them to verify whether a claimant is the rightful one. The board has 8 million policyholders. We will give them our details. Then, they can cross-check the authenticity of a claimant. This will help avoid huge financial frauds. In fact, the government should have made it mandatory earlier.But people including lawmakers in the federal parliament have strongly opposed the decision saying that the government made National ID mandatory without first distributing the cards to the people.Nepal’s total population is over 30 million. Our principal stakeholders are citizenship card holders. Those 16-year-olds are eligible for citizenship cards. The Election Commission distributes voting cards to those above 18 years. We got the data from the commission and added 20 percent and estimated that we have 18.6 people above 16 years old. As of Friday, we have already distributed the National ID numbers to 14.9 million people. Now, as per our estimate, around 3.7 million people are yet to get the National ID. Millions of people are abroad. Thus, we are headed towards saturation point in terms of data collection and issuance of the numbers. One thing I want to stress is that people don’t need a hard copy of the National ID card. The number is sufficient. Printing cards is costly. We have to pay around 2 euro to procure a blank card. The cost of printing, delivery and other overhead expenses is added to that. With the task of printing over a billion copies of ID cards being too costly, even India discourages use of hard copy of the cards. You can create the QR code of your card, save it in your mobile or print it in a paper and scan it wherever you need it.Officials at our government agencies bring up the rule that makes it mandatory to present a physical copy of citizenship card or other documents for official works.Yes, we are trained and habituated in that way. Now we need to change. We must make offices paperless while developing a strong database system. We have been using citizenship cards to verify the identity of a person for a long time. Biometrics not only helps identify people but also trace their activities. Recently, Rs2 billion was found in the bank accounts of a 26-year-old man. The money was deposited in 56 bank accounts. He used 13 ATM cards and 17 phone numbers. Once the National ID card is implemented, transactions and movements of such wrongdoers will be easily traced and monitored. Identifying individuals accurately is crucial to ensure good governance and strengthen security. Many people have acquired fake citizenship cards. People even made fake passports. Implementation of National ID will control it. It is also related to our national image. It will help improve the status of our passport and add authenticity to our other documents as well.Once the National ID comes into wide use, our details will be traced and used by multiple agencies. State agencies and other institutions benefit from the integrated database as they can easily trace us. But how do you ensure our data isn’t misused and it doesn’t make us insecure?If you have a National ID card, you don’t need a hard copy of your driving licence. There is a backlog of around 2.1 million licences. The government has failed to print and distribute them. We told them, we have already procured 12 million cards. Of them, 3.2 million cards have already been printed and we still need to print around 8 million cards. Once the licence data is integrated with the National ID card, it will be shown there. Now, to come to your question, only the traffic authority can access the licence-related data. The device they use will trace only relevant data. Only an authorised agency will get access to the data and it can’t be used for anything other than the stated purpose. We give access to agencies like Nepal Rastra Bank, Nepal Telecommunication Authority and Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal. Then they regulate the things in their domain. No unauthorised body or individual can access it. Do the implementing agencies have infrastructure to use this technology?We are in a position to implement it in some parts of the country. Therefore, we are implementing it in phases. We are making it mandatory for certain services in 28 districts from mid-July. We should have started much earlier. It must be expedited.Lawmakers said in a Parliament meeting that the decision has ‘terrorised people’ in the 28 districts as locals feared they might be deprived of the services as the government has made National ID cards mandatory without first distributing them.We started the National ID registration process from 2018. Registration teams reached in each local ward except in Mugu and Humla districts of Karnali. It was carried out as a campaign. Even after the drive’s completion, the registration process was open in all the 77 districts, 54 area administration offices and in palika (local unit) centres. We also had registration centres in major downtowns. We receive data of around 4,000 registrations a day. So, there has been sufficient initiative and enough time to encourage people to get the number. Besides, if anyone in the 28 districts are still to get the ID number, they still have three months to register.You said only an ID number but no hard copy was needed to access any kind of service, right?Exactly. There is no provision that states one should produce a hard copy to get any service. You give the number and your biometrics to verify that you are the right person. Then, the official can crosscheck it in the database within seconds.Do all the implementing agencies have the devices that read the National ID cards?We have distributed 4,200 machines that read the cards in 333 local units of the 28 districts. Likewise, we have asked other local units and districts and some agencies such as banks to procure the devices and we have given the specifications based on their requirements. A device costs just around Rs 1,500. You can enter the number and place your thumbprint on it. We have trained relevant officials from all the local units for the purpose.How many cards can the department print at present?We can produce 1,500 cards an hour. But now we are producing only 1,800 a day. We have the strength to distribute 30,000 cards a day but are distributing only 5,000 a day.Again the same question. Then why are people not getting the cards?There is some communication gap. People who registered in 2018 or 2019 haven’t contacted us. We are giving them priority to clear the backlogs. But people who are newly-registered are showing more interest. So, we need to strike the right balance.When will the department be in a position to distribute the cards to all the people?At present, we can print 100,000 cards a month. We have a space to double the capacity. Meanwhile, people have now shown more interest. By enhancing our facilities’ capacity, we can print the pending 8 million cards in the next 40 months.What about election cards? Do we need to register for that and get the voting cards?In fact, the Election Commission doesn’t need to collect data and issue cards. We will talk to them. As a constitutional body, we have to readily make the data available for them. In fact, the National ID Card system can help the commission make voting arrangements for the Nepalis abroad because it can accurately identify the right person and can immediately update the integrated system here in Nepal about the votes cast in any country. This card will be helpful in conducting fair elections because the biometric data stored in this system will be perfect bases to identify the people and instantly update the activities in the database.You have emphasised replacement of other cards by the National ID cards. How long may it take to do so?We plan on giving priority to three sectors—banking, civil aviation and telecom. People right now need to fill separate forms for these services that have irked the service seekers. We have asked the bankers to buy the devices. We as a supplier are ready. Now the stakeholders should be ready too. It will benefit them because it helps control frauds.What if I don’t register for the National ID card?In the first place, you will be deprived of social security funds, pension, insurance policies. Likewise, the government will gradually make the card compulsory to receive many other services such as driving licence, land transaction, telephone numbers, bank accounts. How do you assure that our data stored in this system isn’t misused?See, the current practices make you more vulnerable. Because multiple agencies take your data for various purposes. Do they have a system to protect the data and ensure that it isn’t misused? But when your data is stored only by a dedicated government agency, it will be more secure as the agency is specialised for that. When other authorised agencies seek data, we give them access only to the relevant one. We have a National Identity Management Information System (NIMIS). We have maintained three layers of security—L1, L2, L3—to ensure foolproof security of the data. There are three servers.Are we dependent on any foreign company for any related service?So far, only one international vendor is involved but we are cutting down its involvement as well, with a plan to ultimately replace it by our own agency. The vendor now helps transfer collected data to the printing machine through the Automated Biometric Identification System (ABIS). But our plan is to do so through our own government agency or local vendor. We do all the other tasks. Security printing is done within the office basement where every movement of people is monitored and recorded. \nThe implementation of the federal system in Nepal has faced challenges due to centralized decision-making, lack of commitment to federalism by major political parties, and a lack of clarity in constitutional provisions.\nHeavy rainfall with thunderstorms expected in eastern, central, and western Nepal, with isolated heavy rainfall in northern and far western regions.\nRainfall with thunder and lightning is expected in several regions on Wednesday, possibly heavy, with very heavy rainfall in parts of Koshi Province.\nLight to heavy rainfall with thunder and lightning predicted across multiple provinces, including the possibility of very heavy rainfall in some areas.\nCloudy conditions, scattered rainfall (light to heavy in some provinces), and moderate temperatures prevail nationwide.\n\nBe elaborative as possible.
