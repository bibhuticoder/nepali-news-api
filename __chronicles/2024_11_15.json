Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli said that his upcoming China visit will not hurt Nepal’s ties with India.Speaking at the concluding session of the Kantipur Conclave in Kathmandu on Thursday, the prime minister, who is set to visit China in the first week of December, stated there is no reason for his visit to harm relations with India just because he is going to China first than India. “We are a sovereign nation and we have never said that we won’t visit India,” the prime minister said, adding, “We choose to go where it is convenient.” Traditionally, Nepali prime ministers have made India their first port of call after assuming office. However, after failing to receive an invitation from India for several weeks, the prime minister went to New York to attend the 79th session of the UN General Assembly where he met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi, and several other world leaders.“I went to the US to attend the UN General Assembly because the UN is [headquartered] in the US, where I met several world leaders, but it does not mean that I wanted to visit the US first,” said Oli, adding, “We are surrounded by two great neighbours and we have to maintain good relations with them.”“And my visit to China will not damage our relations with India. Our relations with India are deep, historical, based on culture and tradition, and predate the formation of modern states. We are sovereign nations and make foreign trips as per our convenience,” said Oli.Oli was speaking at the Kantipur Conclave’s concluding session moderated by Kantipur Editor-in-Chief Umesh Chauhan on Thursday.During the interaction, Oli discussed a range of domestic issues including the country's economy, national politics, issue of constitution amendment, relations between the federal and provincial governments, and the arrest of Rastriya Swatantra Party chairman and former deputy prime minister Rabi Lamichhane, among other things. Responding to the ongoing street protests by Rastriya Swatantra Party supporters opposing the arrest of their party chief, and the calls by some groups calling for the restoration of monarchy and dissolution of the current constitution, the prime minister said he is ready for any kind of open discussion on these issues. He said he welcomes dialogues on the future of the political system, but won’t allow the constituion to be torn down.Oli also defended the progress made over the last three decades (since the restoration of democracy in 1990), highlighting significant strides in infrastructure. “Road networks have now reached 98 percent of the country.” On the arrest of Lamichhane, who is in police custody on charges of cooperatives fraud, the prime minister stated that he cannot protect Lamichhane if he had committed wrongdoings.\"The court will look into his case…if someone makes mistakes and blames others, it is unacceptable,\" said Oli. Oli also gave some background on how he had helped Lamichhane and hired him as a television anchor when he was jobless. “I gave him the job, and he later joined politics,” said Oli, adding that he would not tolerate corruption.I favoured him, but I never thought that Rabi was involved in cooperative scam,” said Oli, and claimed that he was initially against forming the parliamentary probe, but Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Lamichhane himself requested such a probe. Rastriya Swatantra Party’s protests and demonstrations “aimed at pressuring the court” are unacceptable, Oli said, adding, “Let the law take its course.”The prime minister also dismissed the allegations that the government was working on a new law on political parties to facilitate party splits. “There is a void so we have to bring a new law,” he said, adding “The UML does not need to be the largest party to claim the premiership.” It is believed that the government wants to make party splits easier, because the UML wants to merge dissident groups in a few parties including the CPN (Unified Socialist) and the Janata Samajbadi Party into its fold.Speaking at the conclave, the prime minister said the government will bring laws to support provincial governments.“We will review the constitution. We will enact laws. We will provide them [provinces] the required rights.” \nNepal’s multiple requests to India to ease Nepal’s export restrictions by easing the Bureau of Indian Standards certification process have gone unanswered, according to two officials who are aware of the development.Government officials say the restrictions began two years ago with export barriers on cement, and multiple requests have been submitted to India seeking to address the matter.“Since the Bureau of Indian Standard (BIS) certificate issues started hindering Nepali manufacturers and exporters, the Ministry of Industry, through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, has regularly informed its Indian counterpart about the issue and requested changes to the process. But there has been no response,” a top official of the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies told the Post on condition of anonymity.According to the Cement Manufacturers’ Association of Nepal, a dozen Nepali cement factories applied for BIS certification in 2022 to make their products eligible for export, particularly to India. According to the manufacturers the Post spoke to, the certification should be issued two months after the manufacturers' applications are processed. But none of them have been able to get it.Export of Nepali cements has been stalled time and again over BIS-related issues.“The issues started with cement, and since then, Indian authorities have expanded restrictions to include many other goods like Goldstar shoes. They have halted exports of all products. There has been no development on the issues to date,” said the official.The Post’s attempts to get a comment from the Indian Embassy in Nepal were unsuccessful.In 2020, the Indian government asked the BIS to prescribe mandatory standards for imported goods in line with international quality norms. The move aimed to prevent Chinese goods from entering India through neighbouring countries.After banning Chinese apps, the Indian government imposed import restrictions on more than 370 Chinese products.Insiders say India does not want any products from Nepal with Chinese components, including Nepal’s hydroelectricity, which is greatly worrying top Nepali exporters.India is Nepal’s largest export destination. The country exported goods worth Rs103.18 billion in the last fiscal year, which ended in mid-July. Similarly, Nepal’s imports from India are massive, amounting to Rs996.68 billion, out of the country’s total imports of Rs1.59 trillion.Nepal majorly exported zinc sheets, shoes and sandals, textiles, tea, polyester yarn, jute goods (hessian and sacking), and fruit juice.According to Nepali authorities, they have been closely watching the issue in other southeast Asian countries.They say Vietnam is also a victim of India’s new rule curbing Chinese components in exports.According to media reports, in May, Vietnam's trade ministry wrote to New Delhi to expedite BIS certification for 26 companies, stating that the delays are hurting business. Most of these companies are engaged in the trade of shoes or steel.The reports say that manufacturers from other countries, especially Chinese companies, are also facing delays in securing BIS certification. In Nepal, domestic manufacturers of sanitary pads and diapers, footwear, cement, and plywood said that despite completing all the processes to obtain a BIS certificate to export their products months ago, they have not been able to get it.Nepal has raised the issue many times with India and even the domestic private sector communicated directly with the BIS, but the Indian side has not responded.The producers said despite completing lab tests and paying fees for BIS certification, no team from India has visited to inspect their factories.According to The Indian Express, India’s Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal stated on October 16 that quality control orders (QCOs) restricting the import and sale of substandard items in the country have been extended to 732 products to align with international standards and boost exports.“QCOs are a key mechanism through which India is not only raising quality standards to enter the global value chain but also restricting imports from China,” according to the media reports. “Imports from China have already crossed $60 billion during the first seven months of 2024, which is 10 percent higher than the $55 billion recorded during the same period last year.”Goyal stated that, until 2014, only 14 QCOs were covering 106 products. However, in the past 10 years, the government has issued 174 such orders, now covering 732 products.Insiders from Nepal’s private sector trade body said India stopped Bangladeshi goods, citing the BIS certification requirement. When Bangladesh threatened a reciprocal action, India promptly issued the BIS certificate.“We even wrote to the Indian authority multiple times, but our requests have fallen on deaf ears,” Dol Raj Adhikari, president of the Nepal Sanitary and Diaper Association, told the Post in a recent interview.As per the provision, once the Indian inspection team gives a green signal after factory inspection, goods can be exported to India.The BIS deals with the marking and certifying goods, incorporating quality standards and information on international norms to be followed while importing.According to the Nepal Sanitary and Diaper Association, Rs250 million worth of sanitary pads and diapers has been stranded in the warehouses for the past three months.Likewise, a big consignment of Goldstar shoes failed to get export clearance after India refused to issue the BIS certificate, putting Nepal’s homegrown shoemaker on the brink.Exports from the cement makers in Rupandehi—such as Arghakhanchi Cement, Sarbottam Cement, Palpa Cement, and Balaji Cement—have completely stopped for nearly two months. Cement plants in Rupandehi are on the verge of shutting down or running under-capacity.India even stopped importing plywood from Nepal due to the BIS issue, but later, it provided certification-free exports until March 2025.Plywood manufacturers said that India is not renewing their quality certificate or providing a BIS certificate even after completing the process in June.Goods under the BIS with compulsory certification are any variety of cement manufactured or sold in India, steel and iron products, chemicals, fertiliser, polymers and textiles, cables, flat transparent sheet glass, cattle feed, footwear, centrifugally cast (spun) iron pipes, jute bags, viscose staple fibres, geotextiles, portable water bottles, plywood, and wooden flush door shutters, among others.The private sector said that the BIS certificate issue has put the industries in Rupandehi in a big dilemma. They were opened to export goods to India. \nOn Wednesday, Nepal national U-19 women’s cricket team followed the path of U-19 men’s cricket team and senior men’s team to reach their maiden T20 World Cup. It will be the first occasion any women’s cricket team from Nepal will appear at the global event when the ICC U-19 Women’s T20 World Cup kicks off in January next year.Last month, Nepal national women’s football team reached their 12th final of a major competition—second of the year and sixth in the SAFF Women’s Championship—but could not win their first international trophy.In August, Nepal national women’s volleyball team’s bid to win an international trophy at home remained unfulfilled when they lost the final of the CAVA Women’s Volleyball Nations League.The same month, Para-taekwondo athlete Palesha Goverdhan created history when she won a bronze medal at the 2024 Paris Paralympic Games , becoming the first ever athlete from Nepal to win a Paralympic medal. Last year, Arika Gurung won Nepal’s only third ever silver medal at the Hangzhou Asian Games in China.Nepali women athletes have shown immense potential that they can go very far in the international competitions, yet they consistently face a lack of essential investment, infrastructure, resources, and support.“There were high hopes that the women’s team would reach the World Cup before the men’s team,” national women’s cricket team captain Indu Barma said while speaking during a session titled ‘Women’s Champions From The Field’ at the Kantipur Conclave on Thursday. “However, women’s cricket was completely ignored after the Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) was suspended, which was a huge blow to our motivation.”Barma, who guided her team to their first Asia Cup since 2016 earlier in July, stressed the need for more focus in the development of women’s sports.“The cricket governing body has shown commitment to advancing women’s cricket. They have provided us with annual contracts. But this alone is not sufficient,” she added. “Unlike men’s cricket, we lack a proper league like the Nepal Premier League. We have asked CAN to establish a women’s league. It’s their responsibility to create a platform for us to compete, just as it is our responsibility to deliver results.”The Prime Minister Cup Women’s National T20 Cricket Tournament was the only domestic tournament held for women’s cricketers this year.National women’s football captain Anjila Tumbapo Subba expressed similar frustration at the event.“We’ve been labelled as losers. But the concerned authorities need to consider why the national women’s team repeatedly falls short—especially in the final,” Subba said.“They should assess how far other South Asian teams have progressed compared to Nepal,” Subba added, referring to Bangladesh, who defeated Nepal in the final for a second successive tournament and won the SAFF Women’s Championship for a consecutive time.In fact, the story of women’s football in Nepal is more depressing than that of cricket.It was Bangladesh’s second title in their third attempt in the title match at the SAFF competition.On the contrary, Nepal were competing in the SAFF after only two weeks of preparation and without playing any international friendly matches.The perception of the world towards the Nepali women’s football has shifted dramatically since their outstanding journey to the final of the WAFF Women’s Championship in February this year. The love for Nepali women’s football was evident during the SAFF Championship, when over 16,000 supporters packed Dasharath Stadium to cheer for them in the semi-final against India and the final. Outdoor screenings were also crowded and online broadcasts also reached record-breaking viewership.However, All Nepal Football Association (ANFA), the nation’s football governing body, has recently posed the greatest challenges to Nepali football. ANFA has failed to organise the Martyrs Memorial A-Division League—country’s premier league—for more than 500 days now.Though the women’s league was finally held after a two-year hiatus, ANFA has yet to announce the schedule for the second round. There are even concerns that, as happened in the 2022-23 season, ANFA might declare champions without completing the league.“It’s ironic that they’ve set their sights on the 2027 FIFA Women’s World Cup when we don’t even have a proper domestic league,” Subba said. “How can they expect results from us under these conditions? We have world-class players like Sabitra Bhandari and Preeti Rai, but with this level of investment and resources, our World Cup dreams will remain out of reach,” added Subba, who recently signed for Greek A-Division club Nees Atromitou, becoming only the second player from Nepal to play in the European league after Bhandari.Bhandari, Nepal’s all-time highest goal scorer in both men’s and women’s football (53 international goals in 52 appearances), plays for En Avant Guingamp in Premiere Ligue, the highest level women’s league in France.“I’m not saying that the authorities haven’t done anything—they’ve introduced equal pay, and they’ve put effort into developing women’s football and supporting players,” Subba acknowledged. “But more is needed. With greater support and investment, we could absolutely reach the World Cup soon.”The situation for women’s volleyball players in Nepal is even more challenging. National women’s volleyball players receive a monthly salary of just Rs5,000, which became possible with the initiative of the Nepal Volleyball Association. In comparison, women’s cricketers earn between Rs20,000 and Rs50,000 through their central contracts, while women’s footballers receive Rs30,000.“Our salary is very low, but the Nepal Volleyball Association is doing its best for us,” said Salina Shrestha, a national women’s volleyball player. “I hope the government will take our concerns seriously and offer us more financial support.”“Another major issue we face is the lack of a dedicated covered hall for training,” Shrestha added. “We have to wait for our turn to practice at the National Sports Council’s covered hall. We’ve already asked the government to build us a separate one, and they’ve promised to provide it soon.”Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli expressed a rather brutal stance regarding the low monthly salaries of women’s volleyball players.“For now, encouragement is all we can offer,” Oli said in response to a question from Kantipur Editor-in-Chief Umesh Chauhan about the government’s plans to improve support for women’s volleyball players during the session In Conversation With The Prime Minister. “There’s nothing more we can do for them.”He acknowledged the need to support athletes, saying, “It’s true we should do something for the players. The government has honoured them with rewards from time to time.”Asian Games silver medallist Gurung said that players must also find motivation within themselves to achieve success. \nIn a landmark development for sub-regional energy cooperation, Nepal has begun exporting electricity to Bangladesh through Indian transmission infrastructure, marking the first instance of Nepal trading power with a third country.The export of 40 megawatts (MW) of electricity follows the historic trilateral agreement signed on October 3 between the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA), Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB), and India’s NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam (NVVN). This agreement facilitates the transmission of Nepal's hydroelectricity to Bangladesh through India's cross-border grid.The energy export was virtually inaugurated by Energy, Water Resources and Irrigation Minister Deepak Khadka of Nepal; Power, Housing and Urban Affairs Minister Manohar Lal of India; and Energy Advisor Muhammad Fouzul Kabir Khan of Bangladesh on Friday. Minister Khadka highlighted the event as a milestone and a reflection of the shared vision for a sustainable and interconnected energy future. “This milestone is a reflection of our shared vision for a sustainable and interconnected energy future in South Asia,” he said.The Indian Ministry of External Affairs mentioned the deal as a significant step in promoting sub-regional energy connectivity.“The start of this power flow from Nepal to Bangladesh through India is expected to boost sub-regional connectivity in the power sector,” read the statement issued by the MEA, India. Nepal will transmit the electricity through the 400KV Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur line in India, which will relay the power to Bangladesh. The export that started Friday afternoon will last only until Friday midnight. The two sides have agreed to trade energy during the period from June 15 to mid-November. The three countries worked to export at least for a day so as to start the implementation of the tripartite agreement from this season. NEA estimates an annual revenue of approximately Rs330 million from the deal. For Nepal, this is the first instance of exporting electricity in dollars.Energy officials have praised the agreement as a milestone for South Asian cooperation. Bangladeshi Minister Syeda Rizwana Hasan stressed the importance of Nepal's hydroelectricity in addressing Bangladesh's renewable energy needs, as hydropower constitutes only 1 percent of its energy mix.This first-of-its-kind deal is expected to bolster regional energy integration and pave the way for further cooperation in South Asia. \nRastriya Swatantra Party chair and former home minister Rabi Lamichhane was brought back to Pokhara on Friday as part of the ongoing investigation into the Supreme Cooperative fraud case.Lamichhane, who is in Kaski police custody, had been transferred to Rupandehi on November 12 to record his statement. He was flown back to Pokhara, according to Kaski Police spokesperson Basant Kumar Sharma. Police in Kaski and Rupandehi districts have been investigating multiple fraud charges filed against RSP chief Lamichhane.The investigation centres around allegations of large-scale embezzlement from the Kaski-based Supreme Cooperative, involving Rs780 million of members’ deposits. Lamichhane is accused of misappropriating Rs19.6 million in personal loans from the cooperative, which were allegedly diverted to Gorkha Media Network Pvt Ltd, a company he co-founded.Lamichhane was taken to Bhairahawa on Tuesday for questioning, where police worked to expedite the recording of his statement. The case involves multiple individuals, including Supreme Cooperative’s manager Sagar KC and former chairman GB Rai, with over 25 suspects still at large.Lamichhane’s political career, which began in 2022 after leaving his role as managing director of Galaxy 4K Television, now faces significant challenges as the investigation unfolds.Police stepped up the investigation as per the recommendations by the Parliamentary special probe panel formed to investigate the issues of crisis-ridden cooperatives including the charges of cooperatives frauds against Lamichhane. \nThe deadline to apply for office bearers at the two transitional justice commissions has been extended by five days even as more than six dozen individuals have already registered their interest to serve at the panels tasked with looking into conflict-era cases of rights violations and disappearances.As many 76 legal experts and rights defenders, including the victims of the decade-long Maoist insurgency, applied for the positions of chairpersons and members of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons as the first deadline ended on Thursday evening. However, following demand from stakeholders, the committee to nominate 10 office bearers decided to extend the deadline for applications until Tuesday.Issuing a statement on Thursday, a group of human rights defenders raised questions over the competitiveness and transparency of the nomination process done under an inadequate time to file applications and limited publicity of the call for applications. The victims’ representatives, in a meeting with the selection committee on Thursday, had suggested a deadline extension. The committee led by former chief justice Om Prakash Mishra abided.“We have extended the deadline by five days while also deciding to call for applications through national television, radio and newspaper,” Khamma Khati, a member of the committee, told the Post.According to officials at the Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs, in addition to the conflict victims, retired judges and bureaucrats, lawyers and human rights activists have applied for the vacant positions. \"Former office bearers of the two commissions too are among the applicants,\" an official at the ministry told the Post.This is the first time those victimised either by the state or by the erstwhile Maoist rebels are contesting to lead the commissions formed to investigate the cases of atrocities from the decade-long insurgency.Retired supreme and high court judges, retired secretary-level bureaucrats or one qualified to be a top court justice are eligible for the role of chairperson of either of the commissions, as per the Enforced Disappeared Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act. Those who hold a master's degree, are not members of any political party at the time of application and have contributed to human rights, conflict resolution or law are eligible for appointment as members.The selection committee has set three modalities for application. While individual aspirants can directly apply for any of the positions, different human rights and victims’ organisations can also recommend the names at the organisational level. Such institutions, however, need the consent of the individuals they are recommending. Seventy-one applicants either applied individually or were recommended by some organisations.After collecting the aspirants’ names, the five-member committee will itself collect the names of experts if the names received through personal applications and organisational recommendations do not suffice. The provision of organisational recommendation and selection by the committee itself was included as renowned figures might not be willing to apply for positions in the commissions.A shortlist of probable candidates will be made public only after evaluating their resumes and backgrounds. Interested people can send their feedback on the short-listed candidates.As per its working procedure, the committee will collect public feedback, ask the candidates to make presentations and carry out other necessary tasks before selecting them for appointment.The stakeholders, however, claim that presentations and public feedback alone are insufficient. The victims of the 1996-2006 conflict and human rights activists have demanded mandatory public hearings for shortlisted candidates before making the nominations.The two commissions have remained defunct since July 2022, when the government extended their terms without retaining their chairmen and members. The government claimed the bill to amend the transitional justice law would be endorsed by October 2022, and the appointments would be made based on the revised Act.However, the federal parliament took over two years to endorse the bill. The victims and human rights defenders are now closely watching who will be appointed to the commissions.The amended Act sets four-year terms for the two transitional justice commissions to investigate the cases and recommend prosecution and reparation. However, if they fail to accomplish their tasks within the given time, they may be granted a term extension.The truth commission has received 63,718 complaints, while the commission on disappearances is sitting on around 2,400 cases. As the recent amendment to the Act has included a provision to allocate additional three months to collect the applications, the number will further increase.The commissions, first formed in 2015, have done little beyond collecting complaints and conducting preliminary investigations on some cases. The to-be-formed commissions will be the third formed in a decade. \nThe Nepal Oil Corporation (NOC) has increased the prices of diesel and kerosene by Rs3 per litre, effective from midnight Friday.As per the revised rates, consumers in Kathmandu, Pokhara, and Dipayal will have to pay Rs153 per litre for diesel and kerosene. In Surkhet and Dang, the price is set at Rs152, while in Charaali, Biratnagar, Janakpur, Amlekhgunj, Bhalwari, Nepalgunj, Dhangadhi, and Birgunj, it will cost Rs150.50 per litre.The NOC clarified that the adjustment was made following a new tariff received from its sole supplier, Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), which increased the cost by Rs2.54 per litre for diesel.The corporation classifies depots into three categories, with the first including Charaali, Biratnagar, Janakpur, Amlekhgunj, Bhalwari, Nepalgunj, Dhangadhi, and Birgunj; the second, Surkhet and Dang; and the third, Kathmandu, Pokhara, and Dipayal.NOC sets prices under an automatic pricing mechanism, aligning rates with tariffs provided by IOC, which revises export prices fortnightly for diesel and kerosene. \nDiabetes, a chronic disease caused by high glucose levels in the blood, consistently figures as one of the ten leading causes of death globally. The number of people with diabetes has doubled over the past 30 years, with over 800 million people worldwide now living with the condition, according to a new report by The Lancet. Like most non-communicable diseases, the prevalence of diabetes is particularly high in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In Nepal, 8.5 percent of the population is affected by this disease, and alarmingly, the infection rate continues to rise. Worse, poor countries also have younger people suffering from it, but they lack effective treatment, and the disease often goes unnoticed. By all accounts, diabetes has emerged as a growing public health crisis, calling for urgent measures to combat it.While the more developed countries have been able to reduce the number of diabetes patients over the years, the developing ones often fail to ensure even basic treatment facilities, which has prevented early detection and diagnosis of the disease. Even though diabetes is rooted in our poor lifestyle choices—lack of exercise, junk food, stressful work routines, and so on—the absence of easy access to treatment has exacerbated the problem. This has not only increased untreated patients in LMICs but also led to issues like kidney failure, loss of vision, stroke, heart attack, multi-organ failure, lower limb amputations, and, in the worst cases, premature death.Diabetes and its growing threat in low- and middle-income countries should serve as a wake-up call for governments. Investing in public health is the best intervention for the disease. Still, rather than increasing the budget in the health sector, Nepal is setting aside a meagre percentage (4.6 percent) of the total budget, affecting several healthcare programmes. Even though the country increased investment in health by 2.5 percent this year after facing criticisms for cutting it in the previous fiscal year, the amount falls short of providing patients with basic treatment services for early detection and timely intervention of diseases. The health ministry and authorities concerned should rethink their policies without further delay.The need for behavioural change on the part of the general public cannot be ignored either. Educated and young people living in urban areas have resources and tools that allow them to come to terms with the dangers of diabetes, go for regular health check-ups and opt for healthy lifestyles. Moreover, the government and healthcare workers should initiate awareness programmes, especially for the illiterate population. Hospitals in rural settings must be equipped with the necessary tools to diagnose and treat diabetes. Subsidised medications and insulin can alleviate the financial burden on patients. Policies encouraging healthy lifestyles and food could also go a long way in preventing it.Mitigating the disease has global support. The World Health Organisation recently launched the ‘Guidance on global monitoring for diabetes prevention and control’ framework. Nepal and other low- and middle-income countries should tap into such opportunities to bring tangible results regarding diabetes. They should also emulate successful measures that developed countries have taken to curb the rise of the disease. Collaboration between countries can also facilitate the exchange of best practices among countries. Ultimately, the battle against diabetes requires a collective effort. Individuals, patients, policymakers and organisations should all come together and put in concerted efforts in breaking its chain and ushering in a healthier future for all. \nIn the 1980s, most anthropologists who did research on Nepal were non-Nepalis and most historians who researched on Nepal were Nepali citizens. There were, of course, a few honourable exceptions in both camps. By the 1990s, the situation began to change for the set of anthropologists of Nepal. Although new videshi anthropologists enrolled in universities in the United States, United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, France, Australia and a few other countries continued to come to Nepal to research, the number of Nepali anthropologists also began to grow steadily. Many in the latter group were trained at Tribhuvan University (TU), where the joint anthropology and sociology department was founded in 1981. Some Nepali anthropologists were also trained in universities in the US, Europe, Japan and elsewhere. However, there has been no similar growth regarding the set of non-Nepali historians researching on Nepal. I can’t think of even five non-Nepali researchers who have completed their PhDs in history conducting research related to Nepal in the past 25 years. I am aware of Bernardo Michael (2001, University of Hawaii at Manoa) and Catherine Warner (2014, University of Washington). Both worked on themes related to sovereignty and the Indo-Nepal border. If we want to be generous, we can also add Rhoderick Chalmers to this group, who finished a dissertation in 2003 in a different department at SOAS, University of London, by analysing the formation of the Nepali public sphere in British India between 1914 and 1940. Similarly, Browen Bledsoe finished a dissertation in 2004 at the Department of South Asian Languages and Civilisations at the University of Chicago, working on the inscriptions of the Kathmandu Valley. There must be a few other foreign colleagues who have done doctoral work related to the histories of Nepal in the past 25 years from departments in Indology or literature. There are several reasons why very few non-Nepalis have done history PhDs on themes related to Nepal. The primary reason is related to the structuring of the job market in the field of South Asian history outside of the region itself. While many scholars might be intellectually attracted to doing historical research on Nepal, they soon realise that it is very difficult to obtain academic jobs in the field of history having done doctoral research on Nepal since preference for such jobs is given to folks who have done research on colonial or medieval/ancient India. Take for example the case of the British historian of modern Nepal, John Whelpton. He finished his PhD in history at SOAS, University of London, in 1987. His doctoral research focused on the political history of Nepal between the years 1830 and 1857. In particular, he studied the rise of Jung Bahadur Rana as the national dada. However, even before he finished his PhD, Whelpton had already figured out that getting a regular job as an academic teaching South Asian history would be difficult for a modern Nepal specialist. Hence, he took some time off from dissertation writing to obtain a diploma in the “Teaching of English Overseas”. As he told me recently, this he did as an “insurance policy.” After applying unsuccessfully to academic jobs, Whelpton moved to Hong Kong in 1987 and started to work as an English teacher during the day and a Nepal researcher in the evenings. Things have not changed much in the subsequent years. In the large landscape of American higher education, there are exactly three academic historians of Nepal with tenure: Mark Liechty at the University of Illinois in Chicago (his 1994 PhD is in anthropology, but he has a joint appointment in the history department), Bernardo Michael at Messiah University, and Sanjog Rupakheti at College of the Holy Cross (2012 PhD from Rutgers University). As far as I know, no academic historians of Nepal hold tenured positions in the UK, France, Germany and Japan. RepercussionsThe situation regarding the major absence of non-Nepali historians researching the history of Nepal has been further compounded by the fact that in Nepal, apart from TU and Nepal Sanskrit University (NSU), MA or PhD degree training in the discipline of history has not been available in our newer universities. The number of NSU graduates in history is small, meaning graduate-degree oriented training in history has been limited to TU. This has resulted in inbreeding and a lack of institutional diversity in producing historians. This situation is not very healthy for the social life of the discipline of history since diversity in institutional settings and research approaches is essential for the continued vitality of the subject.Had there been many videshi historians researching the histories of Nepal, then this inbreeding in TU would not have been a major problem. The foreign historians would have brought their national and institutional traditions of historical scholarship to bear on their work on Nepal. They would have also brought a variety of analytical perspectives and approaches. But that has not happened, and this situation is not likely to change anytime soon for the reason discussed earlier. A partial saving grace has been the work of historically minded videshi anthropologists from various countries. I have in mind the work of the late Richard Burghart, Veronique Bouillier, Mary Des Chene, Stephen Mikesell, and several others. But their work has not captured the attention of Nepali historians. Additional mitigation has come from the historical research being done by academics trained in other disciplines (such as Indology and sociology) or in non-university based institutions (for example, Samshodhan Mandal). If new foreign academics are not doing doctoral work in history on Nepal and inbreeding is a problem, then what can we do? First, TU should hire Nepali historians trained in institutions outside of Nepal to revitalise its Master’s and PhD programmes in history. Such a possibility is more viable today than 20 years ago since several Nepalis have either just finished or are about to finish PhDs in history at different universities in other countries. TU could also consider headhunting individuals who have done important historical research but have higher degrees in other disciplines. But given its bureaucratic nature, I don’t expect this to happen anytime soon.Second, other Nepali universities should start graduate programmes in history. In this regard, the recent MOU signed between Kathmandu University and the Southasia Institute for History and Philosophy to explore the possibility of running a Master’s programme in history and philosophy is welcome news. Third, more Nepalis should pursue PhDs in history in good universities in India, the US, UK and other countries so that we have a much larger pool of formally trained historians with diverse institutional and intellectual backgrounds. Despite the general decimation of public universities in India, there are still several history departments in Indian universities where you can get decent training. Several universities in the UK have good history departments, but the funding for foreign students has mostly dried up. History departments in many good American universities do tend to support their doctoral students with financial aid. So prospective Nepali graduate students should check out some possibilities there. \nCyber-attacks on the government and significant business websites are as much a reality as physical insurgency and terrorist attacks. The latest cyber ransomware attack in Uttarakhand on 2 October 2024 brought the State Government machinery virtually to a halt. More than 90 major websites of the Uttarakhand Government, inter alia CM Helpline, ‘Apni Sarkar’, ‘E-Office’, ‘E-Ravanna portal, Chardham registration, and Land Registry were compromised.The Uttarakhand Government’s data centre was hacked, crippling the State’s entire Information Technology infrastructure. This attack, apparently, captured the State’s Information Technology Development Agency (ITDA) server, holding the critical data of crores of people and sensitive government departments, including the office of the Chief Minister, and demanded a ransom. It was no less than paralysing the State Government. One week later, on October 10 2024, the Uttarakhand Government announced that there had been no data loss. However, several critical questions loom large.Cyber experts view it from multiple lenses rather than as mere ransomware attacks or from the perspective of data recovery. The government’s preparedness to combat such a massive cyberattack is under question and accountability is at stake. The data of the last three years, curated by various State and non-State agencies further reflect a vulnerability of the Indian cyber system. For instance, till date in 2024, India has witnessed 388 data breaches, 107 data leaks, 39 ransomware activities, and 59 cases of access sales or leaks. We also sustained nearly 5 billion cyberattacks in 2023.Approximately, 50 government websites were hacked, and there were around eight incidents of data breaches in 2022-2023. In an alarming case, India’s weak cyber security architectural plan and IT infrastructure was exposed two years ago, when in 2022, AIIMS Delhi succumbed to a ransomware attack, compromising critical healthcare services for almost two weeks. This was probably one of the worst setbacks for Indian cyber security infrastructure in recent times.It was a clear signal for governments to envision a clear roadmap to prevent such mishaps in future. However, it seems Uttarakhand overlooked it for want of vision. There seems no plausible answer why the Uttarakhand Government does not have a proper cyber crisis management plan. More so because two years ago, the same Government of Uttarakhand, tasked ITI Limited, in Bengaluru to craft a disaster recovery plan. But it seems the matter has been in cold storage since then. It never saw the light of the day. Probably the government has so far treated cyber security as another welfare scheme which is announced during elections and forgotten until the next term. If this is the case, then we are heading for a bigger aftermath of a disaster after the data breach.A prudent cyber expert’s mind may ask what prevented the State Government from implementing a plan in the last two years? Given the escalating number of global cyberattacks, the State Government urgently needs more specific regulations, guidelines, procedures, or standard operating procedures (SOPs) to combat these crimes. Immediate policy changes and the implementation of effective measures to counter cyber threats are not just necessary but crucial. As we probe this disaster, a Pandora’s box of questions seems to open up. How could the state government overlook recruiting more subject matter experts for the Information Technology Development Agency (ITDA), in contrast to the existing team of three members, who are not even subject matter experts? As it appears, Data backup, a fundamental practice in cybersecurity, was not previously implemented, raising serious concerns about the State’s risk management strategies.There also seems to be a callous approach of the Government of Uttarakhand in firmly conducting a timely security audit of the ‘State Date Centre’. Non-establishment of the cyber security task force till date calls for another alarm in this scenario. While now the State Government has filed an FIR under section 308(4)(extortion) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sahinta, 2023 and 65/66/66C of the IT Act, 2000, there is a dire need for an overhaul of Uttarakhand’s cyber security basic architectural design, recruitment of subject matter experts, inviting consultants on board, setting up cyber security nodal officers in every department, rigorous and continuous training and constant engagement for evolving a cyber-security plan because such attacks may happen again.Precaution is the best cure. A half-baked cyber security plan cannot ensure the safety and security of the residents of Uttarakhand. Uttarakhand is known for cloud burst disasters and 2 October perhaps will be remembered as the Uttarakhand’s Cyber Security Cloud Burst, till a robust plan is placed on the table. It is quite evident that the Uttarakhand Government could not smell or see this coming despite enough reportage of cybercrimes across the country.It was knocking on our doors, and we opened our door wide open, then shooting the ransomware to mitigate the damage. A healthy dialogue between cyber experts and the Government is now warranted for a future roadmap that may not only help rebuild Uttarakhand from the crisis and may even serve as a model for other States to borrow from.-The Statesman (India)/ANN \nThe Bagmati provincial government has made a decision that undercuts the foundation of the provincial system. A Cabinet meeting of the provincial council of ministers led by Chief Minister Bahadur Singh Lama on Tuesday decided to split a ministry to create a portfolio for Madu Kumar Shrestha, who had been serving without portfolio after Lama was elected chief minister and formed a Cabinet in July. This decision has come at a time when the victims of the floods and landslides triggered by incessant rains in the last week of September have been left in the lurch for a month and a half. The government of the province which is worst hit by the disaster has taken a decision to bifurcate a ministry and add liability to state coffers when the displaced people don’t even have proper temporary shelters. Elderly people, children, pregnant women and chronic patients have been forced to stay under tarpaulins. There is no place for children to study as their schools have been ravaged by devastating landslides and floods. This is happening while the provincial government should have concentrated its resources to shift the displaced people to safe temporary huts.When the country’s two biggest parties—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—agreed in the first week of July to join hands to run a coalition government, they said their top priorities would be to end instability, do away with unhealthy practices and anomalies seen in forming and running governments in the provinces and ensure good governance. As the two biggest parties running a government was in itself something unusual in the parliamentary system, they described the country’s present state of affairs as extraordinary, requiring extraordinary measures to resolve them. Political parties in Kathmandu are infamous for doing everything to reach power. The activities of the parties at the provincial level are worse. In the past few years, the inter-party wrangling took such an ugly form that disputes over making and breaking governments in two provinces—Koshi and Gandaki—reached the court, multiple times.There are various groups in Nepal that are unhappy over the adoption of the federal system and devolution of centralised powers to provinces and local governments. At the time of constitution promulgation in 2015, the provincial governments were expected to work hard, connect themselves to the common people who had no access to the central government in Kathmandu and prove that the subnational administrations really listen to public grievances. Unfortunately, the performance of the provinces in the past decade has left a bad impression. Provinces are so unpopular that people have started to say that they would accept a two-tier federal system but not the provinces. Such a voice has become increasingly prominent even as federalism without provinces would be a system without a soul. At a time the provinces are under such scrutiny, chief ministers need to form small and smart Cabinets, restrain from unnecessary expenditures, explore innovative and exemplary practices that would in turn garner public support and build a stronger case for strengthening the federal system. But the decisions like the one Bagmati Province took on Tuesday will do just the opposite: Add to people’s already growing scepticism of the provinces.  \nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz urged Russian President Vladimir Putin in a rare phone call on Friday to begin talks with Ukraine that would open the way for a “just and lasting peace”.In a one-hour phone conversation, their first in almost two years, Scholz also demanded the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine and reaffirmed Germany’s continued support for Ukraine, a German government spokesman said.The call comes as Ukraine faces increasingly difficult conditions on the battlefield amid shortages of arms and personnel while Russian forces make steady advances.“The Chancellor urged Russia to show willingness to enter talks with Ukraine with the aim of achieving a just and lasting peace” the spokesperson said in a statement.“He stressed Germany's unbroken determination to back Ukraine in its defence against Russian aggression for as long as necessary,” the spokesperson added.Scholz spoke with Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy ahead of his call with Putin and would brief the Ukrainian leader on the outcome afterwards, the spokesperson said.Germany is Ukraine’s largest financial backer and its largest provider of weapons after the United States, whose future support for Kyiv appears uncertain following Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election.Trump has repeatedly criticised the scale of Western financial and military aid to Ukraine and has suggested he can put a swift end to the war, without explaining how.Scholz and Putin last spoke in December 2022, 10 months after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, plunging relations with the West into their deepest freeze since the Cold War.Scholz, the most unpopular German chancellor on record, is preparing for a national election on February 23 in which his Social Democrats face stiff competition from left-wing and far-right parties that are critical of Germany's backing for Ukraine. \nChinese President Xi Jinping launched a week-long diplomatic blitz of South America on Thursday by inaugurating a massive deep-water port in Peru, a $1.3 billion investment by Beijing as it seeks to expand trade and influence on the continent.With China’s demand for agricultural goods and metals from Latin America growing, Xi will participate in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Lima then head to the Group of 20 summit in Rio de Janeiro next week, where he will also make a state visit to Brazil.Xi and Peruvian President Dina Boluarte participated on Thursday by video link in the opening of the Chancay port, about 80 kilometres (48 miles) north of Lima on the Pacific Ocean, and signed a deal to widen an existing free trade agreement.Xi said that Chancay, a 15-berth, deep-water port, was the successful start of a “21st century maritime Silk Road” and part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative, its modern revival of the ancient Silk Road trading route.“China is willing to work with the Peruvian side to take the Chancay project as a starting point to forge a new maritime-land corridor between China and Latin America and connect the Great Inca Trail,” Xi said, referring to a 15th century mountain network that joined the Inca empire.In an opinion article in the El Peruano state newspaper, Xi said the Chancay project would generate $4.5 billion in annual revenues, create more than 8,000 direct jobs and reduce the logistics costs of the Peru-China route by 20 percent.The China-controlled megaport was built by Cosco Shipping Ports (1199.HK), opens new tab and received $1.3 billion in Chinese investment for its first phase. China is expected to spend billions more as Beijing and Lima work to position it as a major shipping hub between Asia and South America.The first ship was due to set sail from Chancay next week, transporting Peruvian fruit to China, Mario Ocharan, Peruvian director of the Chancay Chamber of Commerce, said.China's main motivation for developing the megaport, according to Ocharan, was access to neighboring Brazil, where a new railway line is planned to carry Brazilian exports such as soybeans and iron ore to the port.The rail project is estimated to cost $3.5 billion, according to Mario de las Casas, corporate affairs manager at Cosco Shipping Chancay Peru.Building that link is \"crucial\" to improve transportation of soybeans as Brazil is the top seller of the commodity to China, he said.Geopolitical and Economic HeadwindsThe inauguration of the port comes as Beijing is looking to further tap into resource-rich Latin America, amid trade tensions with Europe and concerns about future US tariffs on Chinese exports from the incoming Trump administration.Hundreds of Chinese business executives have accompanied Xi on this trip including heads of companies heavily invested in Peru such as Chinalco, which owns the Toromocho copper mine.Robert Evan Ellis, Latin America research professor at the US Army War College, said that Chancay will make shipping between Latin America and China more efficient.Because the port can handle the biggest ships, it will reduce the need for shippers to consolidate cargo containers at intermediary points, reducing costs and handling times.\"Chancay illustrates how China seeks secure access to resources and markets and its ever more successful fight to corner global value added,” Ellis said.China's major investment in Chancay has raised alarm bells in Washington. General Laura Richardson, former US Southern Command chief, warned earlier this month that Chancay could be used by the Chinese navy and for intelligence-gathering.US anxieties about Chancay reflect a broader, decades-long shift in a region Washington long saw as its backyard. China has overtaken the United States to become the largest trading partner of countries like Peru.China's state-backed Global Times wrote in an editorial on Monday that the port was \"by no means a tool for geopolitical competition\", calling U.S. accusations of the port's potential military use \"smears\".Chinese President Xi Jinping reviews the honour guard alongside Peru's President Dina Boluarte after arriving at the government palace, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, in Lima, Peru November 14, 2024.  \nStar Sports has officially secured the broadcasting rights for the Nepal Premier League (NPL), as announced by the Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) on Friday.Previously, there were informal reports suggesting that CAN was in talks with Star Sports for the league’s live coverage. The agreement has now been formalised, ensuring wide reach and exposure for the inaugural edition of NPL.The first edition of the franchise-based tournament is scheduled to take place from November 30 to December 21 and will feature eight teams. These teams represent various provinces, with two teams from Bagmati Province and one each from other regions.The competing teams include Kathmandu Gurkhas, Chitwan Rhinos, Biratnagar Kings, Janakpur Bolts, Pokhara Avengers, Karnali Yaks, and Sudurpashchim Royals. The league will see participation from renowned international cricketers such as Shikhar Dhawan, Rohan Mustafa, Ben Cutting, Michael Levit, Saif Zaib, Brandon McMullen, and Unmukt Chand. \nTwo Nepali researchers have brought international recognition to the nation by winning prestigious awards at the 2024 The World Academy of Sciences (TWAS) Prize Ceremony, underscoring their groundbreaking contributions to science and sustainability.Tista Prasai Joshi, senior scientific officer at the Nepal Academy of Science and Technology (NAST), was honoured with the TWAS-Samira Omar Innovation for Sustainability Award, which includes a prize of US$4,000.She was recognised “for her pioneering work in improving drinking water quality, particularly in addressing arsenic contamination of groundwater in Nepal.”Prasai’s research focuses on identifying high-risk microbial and emerging pollutants in water and using natural and synthetic adsorbents to remove these pollutants. She has significantly contributed to water purification and sanitation in Nepal and has actively advocated for improved water quality among policymakers and the general public.“Receiving the award has great value in my scientific career,” she said. “I strongly believe that this award would not only strengthen my research capacity but also inspire so many young researchers to achieve more in the advancement of sciences.”Assistant Professor Bipeen Dahal from the Central Department of Chemistry at Tribhuvan University won the TWAS-Atta-ur-Rahman Award, sponsored by The Searle Company Ltd, with a prize of US$5,000.He was recognised for his “contributions to the synthesis of carbon nanomaterials, including carbon quantum dots and their composites, for applications in energy conversion and storage, as well as addressing environmental issues.”Dahal specialises in carbon-based nanocomposite materials for energy storage and separation science. His research aims to address environmental challenges and advance green energy technologies.“It was an honour to receive this award,” Dahal said. “The knowledge and working experience in electrocatalysis and green energy storage further strengthened my research career in this field.”These achievements by Nepali scientists highlight the country’s growing presence in global scientific research and its contributions to addressing pressing environmental and sustainability challenges.The TWAS (The World Academy of Sciences) Awards are prestigious international accolades recognising excellence in scientific research and innovation in developing countries. Established in 1983 by TWAS, the awards aim to encourage and honour scientists who have made significant contributions to the advancement of science and technology, especially in areas relevant to the development of their countries. \nSocial media platform Bluesky is adding millions of users as people flee X after Donald Trump was elected US President and as an upcoming change to the terms of service threatens to complicate legal challenges for the Elon Musk-owned platform.Bluesky has gained about 2.5 million new users in the past week, raising its total users to more than 16 million, it said on Thursday. It is among a slew of apps looking to replace the platform formerly known as Twitter after Musk’s takeover.“We’re seeing record-high activity levels across all different forms of engagement: likes, follows, new accounts, etc, and we’re on track to add 1 million new users in one day alone,” Bluesky said in a statement.Several well-known organizations and personalities, including the nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate, British news publisher the Guardian and former CNN anchor Don Lemon have said they were leaving X due to concerns about the platform’s content and the looming terms change.X was called out by misinformation experts during the election for playing a central role in enabling the spread of false information about the critical battleground states.On November 6, as news broke that Musk ally Trump won the presidency, X attracted 46.5 million visits in the US - more than any day in the past year and 38% higher than an average day in recent months, according to analytics firm SimilarWeb. But more than 115,000 US web visitors deactivated their X accounts – the most since Musk bought the platform, SimilarWeb data showed.Bluesky's website, meanwhile, attracted around 1.2 million visitors on Nov.6, more than Meta Platforms-owned Threads, which had around 950,000 visitors. But Threads app had more visitors than that of Bluesky.“Outsized growth, particularly for Bluesky, may have been driven by a rise of controversial content or technical issues on competitor X,” said Abraham Yousef, senior insights analyst at market intelligence firm Sensor Tower.“The departure of popular accounts, media personalities, or organizations, may have led consumers to conclude that X is no longer their preferred platform, which could also be fueling growth on other platforms, particularly Bluesky and Threads.”TERMS CHANGEThe Bluesky surge comes ahead of a change in X’s terms on Friday that requires all legal disputes related to the platform to be brought exclusively in the US District Court for the Northern District of Texas or state courts in Tarrant County, Texas.The Center for Countering Digital Hate said on Thursday the change could hinder legal challenges against the platform by steering future lawsuits toward judges Musk believes “will be on his side”.“Now, the billionaire will be able to bring lawsuits to friendly courts against whoever disagrees with him on his platform,” said the nonprofit that has faulted Musk for letting hate speech spread on X.X and Musk did not respond to requests for comment.Still, Bluesky’s user count is much smaller than rivals. Threads has about 252 million monthly active users on its mobile app, while X has about 317 million, according to Sensor Tower.“X seems to be in a better position than it has in a while given the ability to represent the views of president-elect Trump,” said D.A. Davidson & Co analyst Gil Luria.“While there are other competing platforms, those may have a hard time catching up with X, since microblogging has significant network effects.” \nThe Public Health Ministry has urged the public to eat healthily and exercise regularly to minimise the risk of diabetes, a deadly disease that plagues over 6.5 million Thais, or about one tenth of the population.Speaking on the occasion of World Diabetes Day on Thursday (November 14), minister Somsak Thepsutin said that more than 90% of diabetes patients in Thailand are type 2, and some 40% do not know that they are diabetic.Type 2 diabetes is a common condition that causes the level of sugar (glucose) in the blood to become too high. It can cause symptoms like excessive thirst, needing to urinate a lot and tiredness, but many people have no symptoms.“To stay safe from the rising threat of diabetes, Thai people are advised to maintain healthier behaviour. One of the easiest tricks is to count the amount of carbohydrates in their daily meals to reduce the risk of diabetes and other non-communicable diseases,” he said.Somsak added that the ministry has instructed the village health volunteer network to teach locals the carb counting practices, as well as encourage people to eat a variety of foods, with an emphasis on low-sugar vegetables and fruits, and exercise regularly.Dr Panumas Yanwetsakul, director-general of the Department of Disease Control (DDC), said that this year, the International Diabetes Federation has set the theme for World Diabetes Day as “Diabetes and Well-Being”, with a focus on ensuring that patients have a good quality of life and happiness by managing their physical, mental, and social health, even while living with diabetes.“Diabetes affects the quality of life of patients physically, mentally and socially because individuals with diabetes face challenges in managing their self-care to maintain proper blood sugar levels,” said Panumas.“They must also manage potential complications, such as cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, diabetic retinopathy (vision loss due to damage to the retina), diabetic foot ulcers caused by nerve damage and poor blood circulation in the extremities. These conditions can lead to infections, which may be severe enough to require amputation,” she said.Panumas advised diabetes patients and those at risk to take care of their physical health by eating a healthy diet, avoiding salty and oily foods, as well as cigarettes and alcohol, and engaging in regular physical activity to reduce risks. The recommended amount is at least 30 minutes per day or 150 minutes per week.They must also manage their mental health by fostering good mental well-being, adopting a positive outlook, and reducing stress and anxiety that may arise from the continuous need for self-care, she added.The DDC chief said diabetics should also improve their social health by participating in social activities to build positive relationships with those around them, even while taking special care of their own health.-In Association with ANN \nSri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake’s leftist coalition won a thumping victory in a snap general election, gaining power to push through his plans to fight poverty in the island nation recovering from a financial meltdown.Dissanayake’s Marxist-leaning National People’s Power (NPP) coalition won 137 seats of 196 for which direct elections were held, a two-thirds majority, Friday’s ballot counting showed. Local media projected its tally would cross 150 in the 225-member parliament after more seats are distributed under a proportional seat distribution system.That would give Dissanayake sweeping powers to even abolish the contentious executive presidency as he has planned.While the clear mandate strengthens political stability in the South Asian country, some uncertainty on policy direction remains due to Dissanayake’s promises to try and tweak the International Monetary Fund (IMF) rescue programme that bailed the country out of its economic crisis, analysts said.Dissanayake, a political outsider in a country dominated by family parties for decades, comfortably won the island's presidential election in September.But his coalition had just three seats in parliament before Thursday’s snap election, prompting him to dissolve it and seek a fresh mandate.The NPP secured almost 62% or almost 7 million votes in Thursday’s election, up from the 42% Dissanayake won in September, indicating that he had drawn more widespread support including from minorities and built on his victory.“We see this as a critical turning point for Sri Lanka. We expect a mandate to form a strong parliament, and we are confident the people will give us this mandate,” Dissanayake said after casting his vote on Thursday.“There is a change in Sri Lanka’s political culture that started in September, which must continue.”Voters directly elect 196 members to parliament from 22 constituencies under a proportional representation system. The remaining 29 seats will be distributed according to the island-wide proportional vote obtained by each party.TENTATIVE ECONOMIC RECOVERYCelebrations were largely muted, with the exception of a few NPP loyalists who lit fireworks on the outskirts of the capital, Colombo.The Samagi Jana Balawegaya party of opposition leader Sajith Premadasa, the main challenger to Dissanayake’s coalition, won 35 seats and the New Democratic Front, backed by previous President Ranil Wickremesinghe, won just three seats.Sri Lanka typically backs the president’s party in general elections, especially if voting is held soon after a presidential vote.The president wields executive power but Dissanayake still required a parliamentary majority to appoint a fully-fledged cabinet and deliver on key promises to cut taxes, support local businesses, and fight poverty.A nation of 22 million, Sri Lanka was crushed by a 2022 economic crisis triggered by a severe shortage of foreign currency that pushed it into a sovereign default and caused its economy to shrink by 7.3% in 2022 and 2.3% last year.Boosted by a $2.9 billion bailout programme from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the economy has begun a tentative recovery, but the high cost of living is still a critical issue for many, especially the poor.Dissanayake also aims to tweak targets set by the IMF to rein in income tax and free up funds to invest in welfare for the millions hit hardest by the crisis.But investors worry his desire to revisit the terms of the IMF bailout could delay future disbursements, making it harder for Sri Lanka to hit a key primary surplus target of 2.3% of GDP in 2025 set by the IMF.“The country has given a clear mandate politically. The key question would be if this is at the cost of economic policy,” said Raynal Wickremeratne, co-head of research at Softlogic Stockbrokers in Colombo.“I think with this majority they may try to negotiate a bit more on the (IMF) targets as well,” he said. “A continuation of the current reform programme on a broader extent would be positive for the country.” \nPresident Paudel returned to Nepal after attending COP-29 in Azerbaijan, highlighting climate change impacts and seeking commitments from developed nations.\nWith Trump's return to the White House, his \"America First\" policy may guide US foreign policy, potentially impacting Nepal's relations and the overall dynamics of South Asia, given Trump's close ties with India and the evolving US-China-India power play.\nNepal's major international airport's ten-hour closure from Friday for expansion will have significant economic impacts, particularly on tourism, transportation, and other sectors, leading to revenue losses and a potential setback to economic recovery.\nAmid global geopolitical shifts, Nepal's PM Oli plans to visit China in early December, potentially setting a precedent and raising questions about India's \"Neighborhood First\" policy and its handling of Nepal's foreign relations.\nPrime Minister Oli has faced setbacks in implementing several plans, including removing the Deputy Speaker, introducing an ordinance on party splits, and accepting a donation for the party's new headquarters, highlighting his diminished authority since becoming prime minister.\n\n\nRae was the envoy to Kathmandu during the promulgation of the 2015 constitution and the subsequent blockade. In this conversation, Rae talks about the evolution of Nepal-India ties since the blockade, regional geopolitics, what the two countries get wrong about each other, how New Delhi views Nepali communist parties and the governments they lead, and the change (if any) in India’s neighbourhood policy since the start of Narendra Modi’s third term in office. \nKunwar has been the MD for just under three years. Before coming back to her homeland to join Daraz Nepal, she worked at different American companies, including Amazon, the world’s biggest e-commerce platform.

You’ve published seven poetry books. Can you describe in brief what these books are about?I regularly write English poems and submit them to journals and magazines. Once published, I collect them into books. My first book explored self-reflection in a romantic, lyrical style, and I write primarily in free verse with a philosophical touch.In my second book, the poems critique literature, time, and politics with a more concise style. My third book delves into themes of mentality, humanity, love, peace, remorse, discernment, grief, loss, and redemption.The fourth book is rich in symbolism, touching on themes like war, death, travel, memory, and honouring ancestors. My fifth book is entirely free verse, featuring an experimental style focused on spontaneity and setting. My sixth book brings simplicity to abstract ideas, with some poems addressing contemporary issues.The seventh book incorporates mythical and spiritual themes. The title poem suggests that modernity and tradition coexist in Kathmandu. You went to Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU). How has studying literature in two different cultural contexts influenced your writing?At JNU, I came to appreciate the value of one’s own culture. Assigned to write a term paper on Nepal’s counterculture, I immersed myself in a range of global subjects, including world literature, German philosophy, Greco-Roman mythopoesis, science fiction, American and Jewish literature, and caste-related literature.India’s emphasis on cultural heritage inspired me, and I am now drawn to Nepalese Writings in English, much like Indian Writings in English, which are widely studied in India. My work reflects a deep respect for culture. As a global language, English allows us to tell Nepal’s stories.As a poet, flash fiction, and short story writer, how do you decide which medium best expresses a particular idea or emotion?A poem can distil any literary idea into a concise form, using symbolism and artistry to reflect the essence of any era. Poetry has a unique power to emotionally connect with readers, though it often leans toward subjectivity. When I want to incorporate diverse perspectives or create a new fictional world, I turn to stories and flash fiction, as flash fiction allows for rich character sketches in brief.Do you have specific rituals or environments that help you write?I write poems wherever inspiration strikes—on buses, aeroplanes, hotel rooms, and airport lobbies. When an idea comes to mind, I write it down, often late at night, capturing at least one poem before the day ends. I don’t need a peaceful writing setting; travel especially fuels my creativity. For instance, while walking the streets of Kathmandu, the idea for my poem ‘Finding My Soul in Kathmandu’ emerged. I later returned to my hotel room and wrote it. Do you believe there is a responsibility for poets today to address social or political issues, or is poetry more about personal expression?Poets are responsible for addressing social and political issues respectfully and sensitively. Writing provocatively about controversial topics doesn’t necessarily improve reality. Instead, poetry should elevate personal concerns into universal themes, using literary devices to deepen impact. For instance, I recently wrote a poem inspired by the floods just before festival season. The poem was abstract rather than literal; I used the image of a “tattered kite” to symbolise the suffering of flood victims.Poetry isn’t a straightforward report of events—it thrives on subjectivity and imagination. In today’s world, war poetry, reflecting our times, feels particularly urgent. Poets can’t ignore current realities. I’ve written poems about the effects of Covid-19 and lockdowns, aiming to resonate with readers’ experiences. When poetry reflects how events like the pandemic have touched people’s lives, it becomes relatable.The symbolic poem ‘Parrot in the Cage’ is a powerful example of opposing political repression. Poetry, at its best, is a symbolic medium, and it’s in this artful representation that the actual skill of a poet lies. What advice would you give aspiring poets?Aspiring poets should immerse themselves in literature and actively pursue publication opportunities. Young poets can also benefit from translating poems into English to grasp the subtleties of language. Exploring the lyrics and poetry of musicians like Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen can be equally enriching. Poets need to engage with the world around them and broaden their perspectives.Sushant Thapa’s book recommendationsCrime and Punishment Author: Fyodor DostoyevskyPublisher: Simon & SchusterYear: 1866This thrilling page-turner feels personal to the reader.

Does Nepal’s Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli fit the same mould as Modi and Trump?Indian political scientist Pratap Bhanu Mehta, for one, does not think so. Mehta said Indian Prime Minister Modi and newly elected American President Donald Trump were ‘populist’ leaders, but he declined to give the same tag to Oli, the chair of CPN-UML.Answering a question about Oli’s ‘populist tendencies’, Mehta replied, “As I don’t see radical anti-elitism in Nepal, and the political leaders are comfortably maintaining the status quo around the elite structure, there is no populist leader in the present power structure of Nepal,” Mehta said.Mehta was speaking at a session titled ‘The Wave of Populism’ hosted by the Post’s Editor Biswas Baral in the Kantipur Conclave in Kathmandu on Wednesday. Mehta also claimed that with the election of Donald Trump as the US President, world politics might see the absence of norms. Trump, who was first elected President in 2016, has been accused of serving an ‘unpresidented’ term and many liberal journalists and public intellectuals around the world have expressed fear over what the businessman-politician’s second term would unleash.Trump has been accused of leading a racist campaign in the lead-up to the election; and Mehta said that it is one of the hallmarks of populism.“Feature of a certain kind of populism is to actually say that the nation has a kind of singular nationality and it should primarily be dominated by one particular group,” Mehta said.“Radical elements of anti-elitism” are the second feature of populism, Mehta added, whereas the prevalence of ethno-identity politics is the other feature.Indian Prime Minister Modi, who is trying to construct the singular ethno-national consciousness in the name of religion, is a populist leader, Mehta argued.Modi, a leader of Bharatiya Janata Party, has been ruling India for over 10 years after being elected as prime minister in 2014.Mehta said that while Modi has tried to mobilise the ethno-national identity to garner votes, the same strategy has not been used in Nepal.He also believes that instead of criticising populist leaders, traditional political parties should offer something other than the status quo to convince the public of their agenda. Mehta said that none of the world’s populist leaders have prioritised solving economic challenges.He cited examples of election strategies in both India and America, observing that “populist leaders do not prioritise economic challenges as campaign issues.” Mehta, however, said that some Latin American populist leaders have raised economic reform as part of their agendas.He explained that leaders like Modi in India and Trump in America often depict traditional structures as their adversaries. “In India, Modi portrays nepotism as one such adversarial structure,” Mehta said. \nPolice on Tuesday took Rastriya Swatantra Party chairman and former home minister Rabi Lamichhane to Bhairahawa in Rupandehi district from Pokhara for investigation.Although Lamichhane was initially scheduled to arrive by Buddha Air’s 7:45 am flight from Pokhara, poor weather delayed the departure until noon. The plane landed in Bhairahawa at 12:28 pm, after which Lamichhane was taken directly to the office of district attorney, according to Rupandehi district police.The office of the district attorney started recording Lamichhane’s statement at 1pm. District attorney Premraj Paudel and his team interrogated the RSP chief about his alleged involvement in cooperative fraud, organised crime, and money laundering. According to sources, Lamichhane denied involvement in the cooperative scam, claiming that he was unaware of deposits made in his name.Paudel said that the office of the district attorney would continue recording Lamichhane’s statement from 10am on Wednesday. According to him, around 20 questions were asked to Lamichhane on Tuesday, but his statement has yet to be transcribed.Talking briefly to the reporters while emerging from the office of the district attorney, Lamichhane said that “caging a tiger doesn’t turn it into a jackal,” implying that he remains unshaken.The former deputy prime minister is currently held in Kaski police custody on charges of cooperative fraud, organised crime, and money laundering. On Sunday, the Kaski District Court extended his detention by 13 days for further investigation.Previously, the Rupandehi District Court issued arrest warrants for 12 individuals, including Lamichhane and GB Rai, on October 24. The two are accused of misappropriating Rs142.9 million from Supreme Cooperative and diverting it to Gorkha Media Network Pvt Ltd. Investigations indicate that Lamichhane had borrowed Rs19.6 million in personal loans from the cooperative.Further probes revealed that Gorkha Media Network’s vice chairman, Chhabilal Joshi Banjade, took an additional Rs24.5 million loan, which was transferred to Gorkha Media’s Global IME Bank account. Records show Supreme Cooperative’s manager, Sagar KC, authorised a loan voucher for Lamichhane, with Roshani Gurung allegedly moving funds into Gorkha Media’s account. Roshani has since been released on bail, while the cooperative’s chairman Om Prakash Gurung remains in custody.An investigation into Supreme Cooperative revealed Rs780 million of members’ deposits had been diverted to other organisations. Authorities believe over 32 individuals, including former chairman GB Rai, former secretary Dipesh Pun, and KC, were involved in the embezzlement, with 25 still at large.In January, police issued a red notice for GB Rai, who is still at large. Rai and Lamichhane co-founded Gorkha Media Network, the company behind the now-defunct Galaxy 4K Television. Lamichhane served as managing director of the channel before joining politics in July 2022.RSP activists stage demonstrationRSP activists and supporters staged demonstrations in Bhairahawa on Tuesday. They gathered at Buddhachowk to protest the arrest of their party chief, Lamichhane. The protesters demanded immediate release of Lamichhane. The RSP activists and supporters earlier protested in front of Gautam Buddha International Airport. They had gathered at the airport area early in the morning.Victims of cooperative fraud demonstrate in BhairahawaAfter RSP chair Lamichhane was brought to Bhairahawa for investigation, victims of cooperative fraud in Rupandehi took out a protest march.The demonstration took place at Buddha Chowk and near the District Attorney’s Office in the district headquarters of Bhairahawa, with victims demanding the return of their deposited funds.Gathering under the banner of the Supreme Cooperative Victims’ Group, protesters assembled near the entrance of the District Court in Burmeli Tole, chanting slogans such as “Give justice to cooperative victims,” “No more cooperative fraud,” and “Conduct an impartial investigation into cooperative fraud.”Over 50 victims participated in the protest, which, according to Cooperative Victims Struggle Committee chair Bijay Nepal, extended from the court entrance to the District Attorney’s Office. \nThe Supreme Court has ordered its administration to accept contempt of court petitions against two dozen Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) leaders for their alleged involvement in obstructing judicial proceedings.Scrapping the decision of joint registrar Achyut Kuikel to reject the petition against the RSP leadership, a single bench of Justice Binod Sharma on Tuesday ordered its administration to register it. Advocate Anupam Bhattarai, on October 30, had reached the court with the petition demanding penalty against top RSP leaders and lawmakers for their alleged contempt of court. Kuikel, however, had refused the petition claiming that it failed to substantiate the defendants’ acts that were contemptuous of court.Bhattarai last week moved the top court against Kuikel's decision. Justice Sharma then allowed him to register the petition.“The court has allowed me to proceed with the petition. I will register it tomorrow [Wednesday],” said Bhattarai. His petition claims that the RSP leadership has been trying to defame the judiciary and create a barrier to justice delivery through regular demonstrations and protests against the arrest of Rabi Lamichhane, the party president.RSP leaders and cadres have been hitting the streets ever since Lamichhane was arrested on October 19 on cooperative fraud and organised crime. Bhattarai has claimed their act is against Article 128(4) of the Constitution of Nepal. In case anyone causes obstruction in the dispensation of justice or disregards any order or judgement handed down by it or any of its subordinate courts, the court may, in accordance with the law, initiate proceedings of contempt, says the constitutional provision.All the central committee leaders including vice-presidents Dol Prasad Aryal and Swarnim Wagle and most lawmakers including Sumana Shrestha and Sobhita Gautam were defendants in the petition that was rejected. RSP provincial leaders, who are hitting the streets, too, are the defendants. Bhattarai will register the same petition.Under the leadership of Aryal and Wagle, the RSP carried out a series of protests in Pokhara where police are investigating the charges against the RSP head. The court has extended his remand multiple times, most recently until November 23.On Tuesday, he was transferred to Bhairahawa from Pokhara after Rupandehi District Court also issued an arrest warrant for his alleged involvement in embezzling millions of rupees from the Butwal-based Supreme Cooperative. The RSP leaders and cadres have staged protests against the arrest in Bhairahawa as he was taken there.The Rupandehi District Court previously issued arrest warrants for 12 individuals, including Lamichhane and GB Rai, on October 24. The two are accused of misappropriating Rs142.9 million from Supreme Cooperative and diverting it to Gorkha Media Network Pvt Ltd. Investigations indicate Lamichhane had borrowed Rs19.6 million in personal loans from the cooperative.Further probes revealed that Gorkha Media Network vice-chairman Chhabilal Joshi Banjade took an additional Rs24.5 million loan, which was transferred to Gorkha Media’s Global IME Bank account. Records show Supreme Cooperative’s manager, Sagar KC, authorised a loan voucher for Lamichhane, with Roshani Gurung allegedly moving funds into Gorkha Media’s account. Roshani has since been released on bail, while Cooperative chairman Om Prakash Gurung remains in custody.An investigation into Supreme Cooperative revealed that Rs780 million of members’ deposits had been diverted to other organisations. Authorities believe over 32 individuals, including former chairman GB Rai, former secretary Dipesh Pun, and KC, were involved in the embezzlement, with 25 still at large.RSP leaders can face jail terms along with fines if convicted of contempt. The Supreme Court Act, 1991 on Contempt of Supreme Court and subordinate courts states that Supreme Court may slap punishment of up to one year imprisonment or a fine up to Rs10,000 or both to the person convicted. \nSince the insurgency days, the Maoists have always been high on conspiracy theories, particularly when it comes to the United States, the superpower they once called an ‘imperialist’ force. The latest instance of this is Chairman of CPN (Maoist Centre) Pushpa Kamal Dahal raising the possibility of the current government pushing for Nepal to join the State Partnership Programme (SPP) proposed by the US government. Based on a media report that no other Maoist leader has seen, Dahal expressed his worry that Prime Minister Oli, who had earlier shown tentative support for the controversial US programme, might now give it his stamp of approval.Speaking at a press conference in Hetauda on Sunday, the three-time prime minister said, “There is something more concerning than the Millennium Challenge Compact [MCC]. It is called the SPP. It has been reported in the US media that the current prime minister has already given theoretical consent to the SPP, and the US government has also made it official. This is a matter of serious concern.”“This government can compromise on national interest to hold on to power,” Dahal further accused. “Theoretical consent is a serious matter in itself. Now, they could soon reach an agreement.”This is the second time Dahal has expressed concern over the Oli government’s possible endorsement of the SPP. Last month too, while addressing a rally organised by his party in Kathmandu on October 26, Dahal had suggested that the Oli government could move forward with the SPP, which was earlier rejected by the Sher Bahadur Deuba government in 2022 when Dahal’s party was a coalition partner.In addition to Dahal, senior vice chair of the Maoist Centre, Narayan Kaji Shrestha, addressing the same rally, had also raised concerns that the Oli government might have already given its nod to the SPP.When the Post asked Shrestha after the rally about the SPP, he said that although they had no concrete evidence, there were enough clues to worry.“I have heard that American media is reporting about the agreement between the two countries regarding the SPP, but I don’t have any concrete evidence to provide,” Shrestha, who served as foreign minister in the immediate past government, told the Post. When Maoist Centre spokesperson Agni Sapkota, the party’s vice chair, was asked about the claims regarding the SPP made by the two leaders of his party, Sapkota told the Post, “I have heard news about Nepal joining the SPP in American media; however, I also need to figure out on what basis the party's leadership is making such a claim.”The Post could get no convincing answer when it pressed these Maoist leaders to cite the concerned US media report that had allegedly published the piece on the SPP. Vijay Kant Karna, a foreign policy expert who had previously served as Nepal’s ambassador to Denmark on the Maoist Centre quota, says there is no chance that the present government will move forward with the SPP, as the previous government had rejected it. However, Karna says there would be no harm even if the government joined the SPP.“The SPP is all about involving army personnel in disaster management. We have seen how ill-equipped and unprepared our state agencies were during the monsoon havoc in September,” Karna told the Post. “Although the SPP is needed for disaster management in our country, I don’t think the present government would take it forward, unlike what the Maoist Centre leaders say.” Karna further says that Dahal, the leader of the main opposition party in the House of Representatives, has the right to seek a briefing from the secretary of the ministry concerned. “If the Maoist party has certain information about it, why haven’t they requested a briefing on the issue?” Officials at the foreign ministry also deny such a possibility. “The previous government already has made it clear that Nepal will not be part of the SPP, so there is no chance of the country being a part of it even now,” an official told the Post. “It is astonishing why the former prime minister has repeatedly claimed such developments.” Foreign policy experts say there is a competition among Nepali political parties to be close to foreign power centres, which may explain the latest statements by the leaders of the Maoist Centre. Yubraj Sangraula, a former attorney general and a staunch critic of the MCC Compact, also dismisses the possibility of the SPP gaining momentum. “This could be no more than a political stunt by the Maoist Centre.” Sangurala told the Post.“Had there been any progress on this, it would have come to light through various means,” Sangurala claimed. However, one of Dahal’s foreign policy advisers during his time as prime minister argued that the Maoist chief’s statement on the SPP can be understood in two contexts. “First, Nepal had requested the US to include it in the SPP in 2015 when Oli was prime minister. Second, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana has been extensively engaging with the Americans,” the former adviser, who tried to defend Dahal’s public statement, told the Post. However, leaders of the Congress and UML, the coalition partners, dismiss the Maoist claims.Even though Nepal had been writing to the US about participating in the SPP since 2015, it became a partner country in the SPP only in 2019. After the earthquake in 2015, Nepal had written to the US requesting participation in SPP for disaster management and humanitarian aid. Nepal wrote another letter in 2017 requesting the same. The US included Nepal as a participant in the SPP in 2019 only after the promulgation of the Indo-Pacific Strategy put forward by US President Donald Trump. However, there was no memorandum of understanding on it. When the US decided to include Nepal as an SPP member, Dahal, along with Oli, was co-chair of the Nepal Communist Party. This party was formed from a merger between the UML and Maoist Centre following the 2017 election, and the government was under their leadership. The issue of SPP first flared up in Nepal when the Commanding General of the US Army Pacific, Charles Flynn, during his Nepal visit in June 2022, urged Nepal to be a part of the SPP during his meeting with then Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and the former Army chief, General Prahnu Ram Sharma. Reportedly, the Deuba government also considered participating. Nepal’s “participation” in the SPP had become a hotly debated political issue, with political parties engaged in an acrimonious blame game. Prime Minister Deuba was put under pressure by the then main opposition, UML, and his own party, Congress, to terminate Nepal’s partnership with the SPP. After controversy erupted over Nepal's partnership in the SPP, the US embassy in Kathmandu also issued a press note saying that Nepal can terminate its participation in the SPP if it wishes to. Later, on June 20, 2022, a Cabinet decision terminated its participation in the SPP. The SPP is administered by the National Guard Bureau, guided by State Department foreign policy goals, and executed by each US state’s senior military officer to support the Department of Defense policy goals. “Through SPP, the National Guard conducts military-to-military engagements in support of defense security goals but also leverages whole-of-security relationships and capabilities to facilitate broader interagency and corollary engagements spanning military, government, economic, and social spheres,” the US National Guard website reads.  \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City has designated 47 locations for floriculturists and flower vendors to sell flowers in Tihar.The city office’s move aims to avoid the inconvenience the floral vendors faced last year and reduce congestion on the sidewalks.“This year, we have designated 47 locations, most of them in shopping malls, marts, parks and party palaces,” said Dharma Raj Bhandari, a police inspector at the city office. “Farmers and vendors can take their products to those designated places and do business at their convenience. Our staff will help them reach the designated areas if they can not do so on their own.”Last year, many floral farmers from the adjoining districts of the Kathmandu Valley who brought flowers in the capital city could not sell their products due to restrictions the city office imposed in many places.The farmers were then allowed to sell flowers at Bhrikutimandap, Tinkune park, Handigaun and Balaju Valley Cold Store in coordination with the Floriculture Association of Nepal and the Nepal Chamber of Commerce. However, farmers and vendors discarded piles of flowers and garlands on footpaths and returned home, incurring heavy losses.The metropolis had deployed its staffers, including the metropolis police, to collect discarded flowers and garlands, which were dumped at the landfill site in Bancharedanda.Officials say that the malls, party palaces and parks will not charge farmers and vendors for providing space for selling flowers and garlands. KMC officials discussed the matter with the owners of the malls and party palaces and requested them to provide spaces for farmers to sell flowers and garlands in Tihar.“Floral farmers and vendors can sell flowers from other private places, but we will not allow them to obstruct footpaths,” said Laxmi Maharjan, a senior assistant sub-inspector of the KMC. “This year, we designated specified sales points in advance to avoid repeating last year’s situation.”The metropolis has also requested that people use flowers produced by Nepali farmers in Tihar and prohibit the sale, storage, distribution and use of plastic bouquets and flowers.“We have already confiscated plastic bouquets and flowers from many places,” said Maharjan. “We will fine traders if they ignore our warnings.”The metropolis has asked floral farmers and vendors to call the hotline 1180 or 015901763 and 9851356509 for help. \nTen people were injured in a bus accident at Ghumaune in Kharipati of Bhaktapur district on Tuesday. Two are reportedly in critical condition.According to Pradeep Khatri, a traffic police inspector and chief of the District Traffic Police Range, the bus coming from Talakot of Changunarayan Municipality lost its control and hit a pole. The injured are undergoing treatment at Bhaktapur Hospital, police said. \nTraffic police have reintroduced the no-horn campaign in Kathmandu Valley to combat unnecessary honking.Officers carrying placards with “no-horn” messages are stationed at various intersections, urging drivers to refrain from honking.Deputy Superintendent of Police Rabin Karki, spokesperson for the Kathmandu Valley Traffic Police Office, said the campaign aims to curb noise pollution through stricter enforcement and public awareness.Despite Kathmandu being declared a horn-free zone in April 2017, rampant horn use continues. Karki said the Vehicle and Transport Management Act prohibits honking in restricted areas, classifying it as a traffic violation.Last fiscal year, 10,123 vehicles were fined for unnecessary honking. This year, 13,003 vehicles have already faced penalties. The awareness drive was relaunched on October 17.Karki explained that while normal hearing can tolerate up to 60 decibels, 70 decibels is harmful. Noise pollution causes hearing loss, high blood pressure, heart disease, strokes, respiratory issues, and memory loss. Loud motorcycles and vehicles with modified silencers or pressure horns are major contributors. The police are focusing on violators, with particular attention to the impact on pedestrians, especially children, the elderly, pregnant women, and those with health issues, Karki said. \nAs the Kathmandu Valley’s air quality is set to deteriorate in the coming days, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City is gearing up to start vehicle emission testing.For this, the city office has purchased a smoke meter (a portable device for testing vehicle emissions), which will be used in coordination with other stakeholders—the Metropolitan Traffic Police Division, the Department of Transport Management, and the Department of Environment.“Vehicle emission testing is mainly the responsibility of the agencies under the federal government, but the constitution has also given local governments the authority to take measures to reduce pollution,” said Sarita Rai, chief of the Environment Department. “We also have developed pollution control guidelines as per the KMC Environment and Natural Resources Protection Act-2021.”Officials say vehicle emission testing will start once the pollution control guidelines are published in the metropolis gazette. In the first phase, emissions of petrol and diesel vehicles operating in the metropolis will be randomly tested, and the city office has also planned to carry out emission testing for motorcycles.Emission testing will be carried out on vehicles that have passed emission testing from the Department of Transport Management and received green stickers. Officials say that vehicles with green stickers could still emit black smoke for various reasons, including lack of timely servicing and maintenance.“We have seen many vehicles with green stickers emitting black smoke,” an official at the Environment Department of the KMC said, asking not to be named as the official is not authorised to talk to the media. “Many automobile owners only service their vehicles ahead of the annual pollution testing.” Officials say that the amount of the fine will be determined based on the suggestions of stakeholders.Vehicle emission testing is among the measures the city office has been taking to reduce pollution levels in the metropolis.The KMC has also started independently monitoring the city's air quality, with support from the Partnership for Healthy Cities, which has provided 19 portable devices to the city office.The Partnership for Healthy Cities is a global network of 74 cities, including the Kathmandu metropolis, committed to saving lives by preventing noncommunicable diseases and injuries. The programme is supported by Bloomberg Philanthropies in partnership with the World Health Organisation and Vital Strategies.Nepal’s air quality reaches hazardous levels several times a year during winter and summer, and the capital city often ranks as the world’s most polluted metropolis. Major hospitals also report a spike in respiratory problems due to the impact of toxic air and dust. Doctors warn that people get sick from respiratory illnesses caused by polluted air throughout the year, due to polluted air.Doctors say air pollution is known to cause various respiratory illnesses. Poor air quality can cause short- and long-term effects on public health. In the short term, it can lead to pneumonia, bronchitis, conjunctivitis, skin allergy, stroke, and heart problems, and in the long run it can lead to severe conditions like ulcers, and cancer of the lungs and intestine, kidney disease, and heart complications.People in low- and middle-income countries get disproportionately affected by the polluted air, which accounts for more than 90 percent of deaths, according to the World Health Organisation.Several studies carried out in the past in Nepal show that toxic air takes a huge toll on public health. Along with respiratory illness, the toxic air has led to severe conditions like ulcers, cancer of the lungs and intestine, kidney disease, heart complications, high blood pressure and stroke, according to experts.The report, titled “Global burden and strength of evidence for 88 risk factors in 204 countries and 811 subnational locations, 1990–2021: A systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2021,” finds that air pollution was the leading contributor to the global disease burden in 2021, making for eight percent of total disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), followed by high blood pressure (7.8 percent). The report was published in The Lancet, a leading international medical journal.Studies carried out in the past show that polluted air has been shortening people’s lives. Nepali lives are being cut short by around five years, according to a report by the Air Quality Life Index (AQLI), which converts air pollution concentration into an impact on life expectancy. AQLI is a metric produced by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago.Toxic air is deadlier than tobacco use and high blood pressure, which reduce life by 2.8 years and 1.7 years, respectively, according to the report.Environment experts in Nepal often point out that worsening air quality has not only affected people’s health but also hit the economy and hindered overall development of the country. \nTicket bookings for public transport during the Dashain festival will open this Saturday. Following discussions with stakeholders, the Department of Transport Management announced that tickets will be available online and at counters to manage the expected surge of nearly two million travellers leaving the Kathmandu Valley for the festivities.According to the department’s Director General, Rajiv Pokharel, transport operators will facilitate online bookings. “We have instructed operators to arrange online bookings wherever possible,” he said. “For counter bookings, passengers must obtain tickets only from official staff wearing uniforms and identification badges.”Around two million people are estimated to leave the Kathmandu Valley during Dashain. The department has introduced 20-point directives to ensure safe and hassle-free travel. Key measures include mandatory checks for alcohol consumption by drivers at major entry and exit points and the requirement for two drivers on long-distance routes. Additionally, those under 18 cannot work as assistant drivers.To assist travellers during Dashain, Tihar, and Chhath festivals, citizen help desks will be established at major locations such as Nagdhunga, Kalanki, Swayambhu, Halchowk, Machhapokhari, Gongabu Bus Park, Chabahil, Tilganga, Koteshwar, Jagati, Satdobato, Balkhu, Dakshinkali, Sundhara, and Sangha in Kavre. An inspection team comprising officials from various agencies will monitor travel arrangements with support from provincial transport ministries.Public transport operating on long and medium-distance routes must follow a designated queue system. Transport expert Ashish Gajurel noted that although bookings are open each year, passengers face difficulties. \"Bus operators don’t increase the number of buses during Dashain, despite rising demand. Authorities must increase the number of buses to ease travel,\" he said.Saroj Sitaula, senior vice-president of the Federation of Nepalese National Transport Entrepreneurs, however, argued that ‘unnecessary’ vehicle checks should be avoided to prevent inconvenience for passengers and drivers. He also highlighted the need to repair potholes on roads to ensure smooth travel.Earlier, Minister for Physical Infrastructure and Transport Devendra Dahal instructed the Department of Roads to complete road repairs nationwide before Ghatasthapana, the first day of the 15-day Dashain festival. The department reported that repairs are underway but have been delayed by the monsoon.The Narayanghat-Butwal road section, part of the East-West Highway, remains a major concern, with only 52.7 percent of its upgrade completed after six years of construction and multiple deadline extensions. The Meteorological Forecasting Division of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology has predicted chances of rainfall in various places of the country for a couple of days more, raising concerns about travel difficulties during Dashain. Other problematic sections include Nagdhunga-Mugling and Mugling-Pokhara, with landslides and potholes reported along various highways, including the Mid-Hill, Madan Bhandari, Hulaki, and BP highways. \n\nThe bill committee of the Cabinet has given a nod to the civil aviation bills two months after they were tabled, allowing the government to table the long-pending legislation in the winter session of Parliament.According to a top official at the tourism ministry, the committee discussed the bills and suggested a few changes in wordings. “After the changes, the bills will be tabled in the Cabinet seeking its approval in principle to register them in the lower house of Parliament. Tabling the bills in the Cabinet after necessary amendments may take a few days.”The then Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government had put the bills into hibernation.On September 6, after being halted by the Dahal administration for over a year, the draft civil aviation bills made into the KP Sharma Oli Cabinet’s agenda. Nepal’s two largest parties—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—took decisive steps to split the country’s aviation body into two entities: service provider and regulator.Since 2007, successive governments have proposed plans to end the regulator’s dual role. However, the bills have been languishing in obscurity, although they are vital to ensuring safe aviation in Nepal.Passing the civil aviation bills would establish an independent regulator and remove Nepal from the European Commission’s air safety list, which has caused immense damage to Nepal’s tourism and put a spotlight on the country’s terrible aviation safety record. In December 2013, the European Commission banned all Nepali airlines from flying into the 28-nation bloc.On October 21, addressing an international workshop on ‘EU-South Asia Aviation Partnership Project II Strengthening the partnership in aviation between the EU and South Asia’ held in Kathmandu, EU ambassador to Nepal Veronique Lorenzo said: “If the law is passed to split the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal into a service provider and a regulatory body, the ban imposed on European skies 11 years ago can be removed.”Tourism Minister Badri Prasad Pandey tabled the bills at the Cabinet on September 6 after the law and finance ministries approved their drafts.When a bill is presented, the Cabinet approves the draft legislation and its introduction to Parliament.Nepal has a terrible aviation safety record—eight crashes—six fatal ones—taking place over the past two and a half years, killing over 100 people.Lawmakers have raised concerns about the government’s delay in implementing the new law, which aims to establish an independent civil aviation regulator. The two long-pending aviation bills—the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal Bill and the Air Service Authority of Nepal Bill—propose splitting Nepal’s aviation body into two entities, a condition for Nepal to be struck off the European Commission’s air safety list.Tourism ministry officials say this is the fourth time they have sent the bills to the Cabinet since they were passed by the upper house in 2021. But every time, the government changes, and the bills return. On July 16, 2023, two months before the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), the European authority for aviation safety, planned a safety audit of Nepal’s aviation system, the tourism ministry sent the draft bills to the Cabinet, seeking its ‘approval in principle’ to table them in Parliament.On August 2, 2021, the upper house unanimously passed the two aviation bills, which had been languishing for a year and a half as political squabbling engulfed the country. They were registered on February 23, 2020.The 15th Joint Commission meeting of the European Union held in Kathmandu on March 19 this year underlined that air safety remains a key priority in their bilateral relations.In 2022, in its final audit report, the United Nations aviation watchdog ICAO formally asked Nepal to split the civil aviation body into two entities.Several aviation watchdogs, experts, and diplomatic agencies have urged Nepal to strengthen its independent regulatory body to ensure safer skies.The government first announced the proposal in its Three Year Interim Plan (2007-08 to 2009-10), which stated, “In the context of the completion of the study on the institutional strengthening of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN), which has been working as the service provider in civil aviation, airport operator and regulator; implementation of doable recommendations suggested by the report is being considered.”Since then, every periodic plan and policy, including the annual budget, has prioritised separating the civil aviation body. But the plan has yet to be implemented. \nA Nepali payment system operator says that if all goes well, Nepalis will be able to scan and pay in India from the beginning of 2025.The process from Nepal’s side has been completed, and the operator is waiting for the Indian authority's nod to begin the system, which is expected to become a game changer in cross-border digital transactions.“We have completed all preparations from the network side. India is making some changes to its payment system. So unless India provides the green signal, we cannot start,” said Paras Kunwar, chief operating officer of Fonepay.In September last year, Fonepay Payment Service Ltd, Nepal’s largest payment network and NPCI International Payments Ltd (NIPL), the international arm of the National Payments Corporation of India, agreed to launch the first QR code-based payment solution between Nepal and India.This historic unveiling occurred at the Global Fintech Fest 2023, a global gathering of fintech visionaries, thought leaders and innovators.“India’s NPCI International Payments has given a timeline till December-end to complete the process on their side,” said Kunwar. NPCI is working on anti-money laundering checks and charges, among others.The central bank allowed Nepali payment system operators to process digital retail payments in any country for purchasing goods and services through person-to-merchant (P2M) on June 27.However, no Nepali operator has shown an interest.This provision allows the Nepali payment system operator to agree with any PSO in any country to launch the quick response (QR) code payment system for the citizens of both countries to make purchases.As Nepal Rastra Bank has imposed rules and regulations for banks to set a daily transaction limit of IRs100,000 while making QR code payments in India, some banks have implemented the limit while others are still in the process, said Kunwar. The banks that complete the limitation process can start transactions once the QR payment operation starts.Kunwar said that in addition to India, Fonepay has reached an agreement phase with Chinese payment apps like Alipay+ and UnionPay for QR code payment.“To complete the agreement, getting approval from Nepal Rastra Bank and completing technical integration might take six months, optimistically, for Chinese nationals to make QR code payments in Nepal,” said Kunwar.In the first phase, Chinese nationals will be allowed to make QR code payments in Nepal. In the second phase, Nepalis will be allowed to make QR code payments in China.“It might take time for Nepalis to scan and pay in China,” Kunwar said.On March 1, Indians in Nepal were allowed to make payments through their mobile phones.The QR code system has become a boon for tourists, especially those from India.It has reduced the hassle of carrying cash as the Nepal government has banned all Indian notes above the denomination of 100.According to Fonepay officials, with the Fonepay service available in Muktinath and trekking areas connected to Pokhara, Indian tourists are increasingly scanning and paying.The value of transactions made by Indian nationals in Nepal through QR code payment has grown and typically increases during the weekends.Indians are making Rs6 million in transactions daily, on average, through QR code payments. “On weekends, it increases to Rs8 million daily,” said Kunwar.In addition to neighbouring countries, Fonepay said it is in the agreement phase for QR code payment with South Korea, Singapore, Thailand, and other Southeast Asian nations where tourism flows are high.According to the central bank report, QR code payments increased to Rs61.39 billion in mid-August to mid-September this year from Rs36.21 billion in the same month last year.The number of transactions also increased to 21.57 million from 11.79 million during the review period.Over the past decade, Nepal has witnessed a surge in digital adoption. According to the central bank report, the 4G/LTE services now cover 739 of 753 local units across 77 districts in Nepal.The smartphone penetration rate is 72.94 percent, and 38 percent of households have access to Internet services.The cost of connectivity has also dropped significantly from $2.25 per gigabyte in 2019 to $0.46 per gigabyte in 2023.Thus, as digital technologies become accessible and more affordable, the digital divide, especially the rural and gender divide, is narrowing.The central bank report said that opportunities still exist for digital innovators, as 50 percent of adults from rural areas and 40 percent from urban areas still lack an account at a financial institution.Nepal has experienced many innovations, especially in the digital payments sector, after the Covid-19 pandemic.New payment instruments have evolved, changing the way people transact and bank. Such instruments are Quick Response (QR) codes, connectIPS (Instant Payment System), Cardless Withdrawal, Smart Point-of-Sale (POS), Contactless Cards based on Near-Field Communication (NFC) technology, Virtual Cards, and Digital Lending.Nepal has further operationalised the Retail Payment Switch (RPS) to settle retail payment transactions within the nation, and the development of the National Payment Switch (NPS) is in progress. \nLarge cardamom prices have reached near-record levels, reaching Rs2,500 per kg in Monday’s trading.The price of large cardamom reached a record high of Rs2,700 in 2014 but dropped to Rs850 in 2018, a dip of about 68 percent. The price again broke records in 2016, reaching an all-time high of Rs3,000 per kg. Prices then began to decline steadily, sinking to a low of Rs700 per kg in mid-July 2022.Birtamod in Jhapa is the main trading hub for large or black cardamom, one of the world's most expensive spices. Traders say that demand for the upcoming Ramadan, observed by Muslims worldwide, has been growing, which may trigger a fresh record in the coming days. “As production has dropped in the major producing countries, demand has grown exuberantly in the global market,” said Nirmal Bhattarai, president of the Federation of Large Cardamom Exporters, Nepal. “We expect that large cardamom will hit a new record soon.”Nepal is the largest producer of large cardamom, accounting for 68 percent of the global production, followed by India and Bhutan.The spice is grown in Sikkim, Darjeeling and Bhutan. Large cardamom was introduced in Ilam from Sikkim in 1865.The major cardamom-producing districts in Nepal include Ilam, Panchthar, Taplejung, Sankhuwasabha, Tehrathum, Bhojpur, and Dhankuta.October- November is the peak harvest season.“We expect production could drop by 25 percent in Nepal due to climate change-induced disease,” said Bhattarai. “The disease has affected old and new saplings of large cardamom in the last two years,” he said.“Large cardamom growers cleared their stock last year as the price reached Rs2,150 per kg in the domestic market due to the fall in production. With no stock remaining and production sharply down, demand for the spice could push prices above Rs3,000 per kg in the local market,” said Bhattarai.India is the biggest buyer of Nepal’s large cardamom, absorbing 99 percent of its exports. The spice is re-exported to Pakistan and the Middle East, where it fetches high prices because of local preference for Nepali products.Pakistan is the largest importer of large cardamom, purchasing roughly 60 percent of India’s large cardamom exports. The local Muslim community uses large cardamom pods in biryani, a popular Pakistani dish, as a symbol of prosperity and wealth. Large cardamom has three types depending on quality.The ‘jumbo jet’ is the largest and it is being traded at Rs2,500 per kg. The standard variety is being traded at Rs2,450 per kg, and the third, normal variety is trading at Rs2,375 per kg. The large cardamom grown in Nepal, known as Alaichi, is one of the country’s largest export crops. It is a high-value cash crop and a key income source for farmers in eastern Nepal's mountains and hills.According to the Department of Customs, Nepal exported 5,367 tonnes of large cardamom worth Rs4.81 billion in 2021-22. Export jumped sharply to 9,990 tonnes worth Rs8.27 billion in 2022-23.The customs record shows exports dropped by 50 percent to 5,018 tonnes in the last fiscal year, 2023-24. In value, exports amounted to Rs7.94 billion. According to the Agriculture Ministry statistics, Nepal produced 9,545 tonnes of large cardamom in 2019-20. Output dropped to 8,289 tonnes in 2020-21. In 2021-22, production rose slightly to 8,714 tonnes and over 10,000 tonnes in 2022-23.Farmers are expanding the large cardamom acreage beyond the eastern hill districts. The spice is also being grown in Dadeldhura and Lamjung.Large cardamom is grown on 18,000 hectares in Nepal. Domestic consumption of large cardamom, however, is minimal.Nepali traders were also making efforts to export large cardamom to Bangladesh directly through the Kakarbhitta-Panitanki-Phulbari route as demand has increased there, traders said.The 44-km route provides the shortest access to the Bangladeshi border point of Banglabandha for Nepal's trade with and through Bangladesh.Nepali large cardamom or black cardamom has a distinct flavour profile due to a specific method of postharvest drying in bhattis (ovens), which explains the roasted smell and taste.The smoky flavour would overwhelm a sweet cake or pudding, but in a spice rub for roasted meat or a full-flavoured stew, it imparts a smouldering depth no other spice can, according to experts.In February 2021, the process of identifying and registering five species of large cardamom indigenous to Nepal formally began, paving the way for claiming ownership rights and patenting them internationally. \nThere are certain phrases that Wachuka Gichohi finds difficult to hear after enduring four years of living with long COVID, marked by debilitating fatigue, pain, panic attacks and other symptoms so severe she feared she would die overnight.Among them are normally innocuous statements such as, “Feel better soon” or “Wishing you a quick recovery,” the Kenyan businesswoman said, shaking her head.Gichohi, 41, knows such phrases are well-intentioned. “I think you have to accept, for me, it’s not going to happen.”Recent scientific studies shed new light on the experience of millions of patients like Gichohi. They suggest the longer someone is sick, the lower their chances of making a full recovery.The best window for recovery is in the first six months after getting COVID-19, with better odds for people whose initial illness was less severe, as well as those who are vaccinated, researchers in the United Kingdom and the United States found. People whose symptoms last between six months and two years are less likely to fully recover.For patients who have been struggling for more than two years, the chance of a full recovery “is going to be very slim,” said Manoj Sivan, a professor of rehabilitation medicine at the University of Leeds and one of the authors of the findings published in The Lancet.Sivan said this should be termed “persistent long COVID” and understood like the chronic conditions myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, or fibromyalgia, which can be features of long COVID or risk factors for it.In a study, run by the UK's Office for National Statistics, two million people self-reported long COVID symptoms this past March. Roughly 700,000, or 30.6%, said they first experienced symptoms at least three years previously.Globally, accepted estimates have suggested between 65 million, and 200 million, people have long COVID. That could mean between 19.5 million and 60 million people face years of impairment based on the initial estimates, Sivan said.The United States and some countries like Germany continue to fund long COVID research.But more than two dozen experts, patient advocates and pharmaceutical executives told Reuters that money and attention for the condition is dwindling in other wealthy countries that traditionally fund large-scale studies. In low- and middle-income countries, it was never there.“The attention has shifted,” said Amitava Banerjee, a professor at University College London who co-leads a large trial of repurposed drugs and rehabilitation programmes.He says long COVID should be viewed as a chronic condition that can be treated to improve patients’ lives rather than cured, like heart disease or arthritis.‘PROFOUNDLY DISABLING’Leticia Soares, 39, from northeast Brazil, was infected in 2020 and has battled intense fatigue and chronic pain ever since. On a good day, she spends five hours out of bed.When she can work, Soares is a co-lead and researcher at Patient-Led Research Collaborative, an advocacy group involved in a review, of long COVID evidence published recently in Nature.Soares said she believes recovery seldom happens beyond 12 months. Some patients may find their symptoms abate, only to recur, a kind of remission that can be mistaken for recovery, she said.“It’s so profoundly disabling and isolating. You spend every time wondering, ‘Am I going to get worse after this?’” she said of her own experience.Soares takes antihistamines and other commonly available treatments to cope with daily life. Four long COVID specialist doctors in different countries said they prescribe such medicines, which are known to be safe. Some evidence suggests they help.Others have less success with mainstream medicine.Gichohi's illness was dismissed by her doctor, and she turned to a functional medicine practitioner, who focused on more holistic treatments.She moved out of her hectic home city of Nairobi to a small town near Mount Kenya, policing her activity levels to prevent fatigue and receiving acupuncture and trauma therapy.She has tried the addiction treatment naltrexone, which has some evidence of benefit for long COVID symptoms, and the controversial anti-parasitic infection drug ivermectin, which does not but she says helped her.She said shifting from “chasing recovery” to living in her new reality was important.A piecemeal treatment approach is to be expected while research progresses, and perhaps longer-term, said Anita Jain, a long COVID specialist at the World Health Organization.Meanwhile, long-haulers face a new challenge with each spike in COVID cases. A handful of studies have suggested re-infection can exacerbate existing long COVID.Shannon Turner, a 39-year-old cabaret singer from Philadelphia, got COVID in late March or early April of 2020.She was already living with psoriatic arthritis and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, autoimmune diseases for which she regularly took steroids and an immunotherapy. Such conditions may increase the risk of developing long COVID, researchers say.This past summer, Turner got COVID again. Once again, she is extraordinarily tired and uses a walker for mobility.Turner is determined to pursue her music career despite ongoing pain, dizziness and a racing heart rate, which regularly land her in hospital.“I don’t want to live my life in bed,” she said. \nA 57-year-old man from Dhading district arrived at the outpatient department of Bir Hospital on Wednesday for treatment of a burning sensation of cramps in his legs and feet. Though the patient was unaware of his diabetic problem, tests showed dangerously high blood glucose levels—fasting blood glucose 270, post-meal 340, and HBA1C level 10.7.Doctors say a healthy person's fasting blood glucose level should be less than 100 mg/dl, post-meal blood sugar level below 140 mg/dl, and HBA1c level below 5.7 percent. “We have to carry out multiple tests to know if the high blood glucose has affected the vital organs—kidney, eyes, blood vessels and others,” said Dr Dipak Malla, assistant professor at the National Academy of Medical Sciences. “These types of patients, from remote villages, who have been suffering from high blood pressure but are unaware of it, often visit our hospital.”Diabetes, a chronic disease, occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin (a hormone that regulates blood glucose) or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. The problem has been emerging as a major public health problem in Nepal. A study carried out in 2020 shows that 8.5 percent of the population, or two million people, have been suffering from diabetic problems. The alarming rise in diabetic patients is a global problem, but in low and middle-income countries like Nepal, the disease has drastically increased, with 450 million adults aged 30 and over with diabetes globally (59 percent) who did not receive treatment in 2022, according to a new report.The report titled “Over 800 million adults living with diabetes, more than half not receiving treatment, global study suggests”, which appeared in The Lancet, a leading international medical journal, on Wednesday, showed that the global rate of diabetes (type 1 and 2 combined) in adults doubled from approximately 7 percent to about 14 percent between 1990 and 2022, with the largest increase in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).Of the 828 million adults with diabetes in 2022, over a quarter (212 million) lived in India with another 148 million in China, followed by the USA (42 million), Pakistan (36 million), Indonesia (25 million) and Brazil (22 million).People living in North America, Australasia, central and Western Europe, andparts of Latin America and East Asia, and the Pacific saw a significant improvement in treatment rates for diabetes from 1990 to 2022, contributing to widening global inequities in diabetes treatment.“Our study highlights widening global inequalities in diabetes, with treatment rates stagnating in many low- and middle-income countries where numbers of adults with diabetes are drastically increasing,” said professor Majid Ezzati, of Imperial College London, a senior author of the report.“This is especially concerning as people with diabetes tend to be younger in low-income countries and, in the absence of effective treatment, are at risk of life-long complications—including amputation, heart disease, kidney damage or vision loss—or in some cases, premature death.”Obesity and poor diet are important drivers of the rise in type 2 diabetes rates and their variation across countries. Diabetes rates were either already high or increased more in some of the regions where obesity was or became prevalent between 1990 and 2022. This was compared to many high-income countries, especially those in the Pacific and western Europe, where, in general, obesity and diabetes rates did not rise or rose by a relatively small amount.The study highlights the urgent need for financing of medicines and comprehensive diabetes programmes that enable early detection and effective treatment of diabetes in LMICs.Experts and endocrinologists in Nepal also said that diabetes problems could be far more than what is estimated. What concerns them much is that even young people suffer from high blood sugar.“Young people in their mid 20’s and early 30’s are also suffering from diabetic problems,” said Dr Jyoti Bhattarai Kunwar, a senior endocrinologist. “Many patients do not have easy access to proper treatment. When patients do not get access to proper treatment, problems will not be diagnosed on time. Detection of diabetes must be an urgent priority.”Doctors say that patients could suffer from major health problems—blindness, kidney failure, heart attack, stroke, multi-organ failure, and lower limb amputations if left with high blood sugar. One could think that diabetes is like any other health problem, but serious health problems start when one suffers from high blood glucose.“The number of patients suffering from high blood glucose has been raised alarmingly of late,” said Dr Ansu Mali Joshi, a senior endocrinologist. “A sedentary lifestyle, changing eating habits, and junk foods have been fuelling the problems. A healthy diet, regular exercise, and stress-free life must be promoted to reduce the problems.” \nAs some over-the-counter drugs are suspected of being abused by young people and others, the Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry has compiled a draft plan to revise the rules on how the medications are displayed.Amid deepening concerns on health problems caused by drug abuse, and as a measure to prevent people from overdosing, the ministry aims to revise the law concerning pharmaceuticals and medical devices by the end of next year.Of the over-the-counter drugs, which are medications that can be purchased without a prescription, about 1,500 products that contain six types of substances that could be abused would be subject to the new rules.According to the draft plan, such drugs will be displayed in areas not readily accessible to customers or that are easily visible to pharmacists. As there are currently no strict regulations on where such drugs can be displayed, the new rules are intended to make sure pharmacists or store clerks give an explanation to customers on how to use the drugs.In addition, those under 20 years old would only be allowed to purchase a single small-portion size of the product, and pharmacists or store clerks would be required to check the customer’s identification. Pharmacists or store clerks would also be required to check the identification of someone aged 20 or older if the customer wants to purchase multiple products that can be abused or a large-portion product.For measures regarding customers who repeatedly buy such products, pharmacies and drugstores would be asked to keep records on them and have such information be shared among the employees. Pharmacies and drugstores would also be encouraged to ask specific questions regarding the use of such drugs to those customers.According to the ministry’s survey in fiscal 2023, 20% of pharmacies and drugstores nationwide did not confirm the reason for the purchase when customers bought two or more drugs that can be abused, a step required by law. Observers are urging authorities to tighten control to prevent drug abuse.-In Association with ANN \nThe Dr. Om Foundation conducted a successful free heart camp in Dhamaura village, Mahottari district, on Saturday, offering essential healthcare services to over 600 local residents.The event, organised on the second anniversary of the late Tej Narayan Singh, a prominent public figure, provided ECG screenings, blood pressure checks, and complimentary medications to address critical health needs within the community.Originally scheduled for three days, the camp was extended due to an overwhelming turnout. Dr. Om Murti Anil, founder of the Dr. Om Foundation, expressed concern over a rise in high blood sugar cases, notably among women in their 40s and 50s, many of whom led healthy lifestyles and had no family history of diabetes. To support those in need, the foundation offered a one-month supply of free medicines and urged patients to continue their treatment.The camp also commemorated Singh’s contributions as a social worker, agriculturist, and founder of Dhamaura Higher Secondary School. On the second anniversary of his passing, Dr. Anil and his family donated Rs 511,111 to Shree Janata Rashtriya Secondary School, established by Singh in 1970. Local educators Manoj Yadav and principal Yogendra Yadav highlighted Singh's role in expanding educational access in the area, while former principal Sushil Kumar Yadav commended his dedication to improving educational standards.Reflecting on his father's legacy, Dr. Anil shared personal insights at a memorial event held at Dhamaura Higher Secondary School, noting how Singh’s values inspired him to stay connected to the community and continue his father’s work.The camp and tributes provided a meaningful platform to honour Singh’s enduring legacy in education, healthcare, and community development in Mahottari. \nDusit Princess Kathmandu is organising a five-day trout festival at its SOI restaurant. The dishes will be available for order from 12:30 pm to 10:00 pm every day till August 30. In celebration of Nepal’s rivers and lakes, which provide an ideal environment for high-quality trout, the Director of Culinary Food and Beverage Service, Chef Utpal Mondal, and his team at Dusit Princess Kathmandu have crafted a menu showcasing the flavours and versatility of locally sourced trout. “As the festive month of Shrawan ends, people focus on healthy and nutritious food. Trout, rich in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and essential minerals, offers a heart-friendly option that checks all the boxes from a nutritional and culinary standpoint,” says Mondal.He adds that the goal of the culinary event is to offer their guests a rare opportunity to experience a wide variety of trout dishes they wouldn’t typically find at home.The event menu features twelve unique dishes, six of which are drawn from diverse culinary traditions across continents. Three dishes are inspired by oriental cuisine, while the remaining three highlight flavours from Nepal and India. The menu has been designed to include various dishes, from soups and starters to main courses, including Mexican, Italian, Continental, and Thai flavours.While discussing the event’s highlights, Mondal said, “The celebration presents a unique opportunity for guests to indulge in a diverse range of trout-based dishes, something they wouldn’t typically have the chance to experience elsewhere.” \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nA stunning bicycle kick from Antonio Sanabria and a second-half header from Omar Alderete gave Paraguay a well earned 2-1 home win over Argentina in the South American World Cup qualifiers on Thursday.Argentina took the lead 11 minutes into the game when Enzo Fernandez’s deep pass found Lautaro Martinez, whose thunderous shot was initially ruled out for offside, but was eventually awarded after a VAR review.Paraguay went close moments later when Gustavo Gomez’s header from a corner hit the crossbar. The home side quickly tried again with Gustavo Velazquez’s cross finding Sanabria, who unleashed a superb overhead kick that left goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez helpless.The shocked visitors struggled to find their feet, with captain Lionel Messi largely absent from the action for much of the first half and only managing one shot that went wide.However, he was twice fouled by Alderete, but referee Anderson Daroco didn't show him a second yellow card before the break.Two minutes into the second half, Paraguay defender Alderete headed in from a free kick following a foul by substitute Leonardo Balerdi on Julio Enciso.Rodrigo de Paul had the best chance to equalise 20 minutes before the end but he failed to control the ball after a breakaway and his shot went wide as Argentina’s errors continued to mount with Paraguay holding firm in defence.“I think, overall, we played a great game. We controlled the ball. Their goals came from two of our mistakes. We need to fix our lapses on set pieces,” striker Martinez said after the match to TyC sports.“{The (goal) at the start of the second half made everything more difficult. We have to congratulate the opponent, who defended very well,” Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni told a press conference.World Cup holders Argentina top the standings with 22 points from 11 games and will host ninth-placed Peru on Tuesday.Paraguay are sixth on 16 points, behind on goal difference to Ecuador, who hammered Bolivia 4-0 on Thursday, and Uruguay, who host second-placed Colombia on Friday.Earlier, Brazil were held to a 1-1 draw by Venezuela , leaving them in third place on 17 points.The top six teams will qualify automatically for the 2026 World Cup hosted by the United States, Mexico and Canada. \nBrazil had to settle for a 1-1 draw at Venezuela after a quick-fire second-half strike by substitute Telasco Segovia canceled out Raphinha’s opener for the dominant visitors in the South American World Cup qualifiers on Thursday.Vinicius Jr missed a chance to win the game with a penalty against a Venezuelan side who played the last minutes of the game down to 10-man after substitute Alexander Gonzalez was sent off for hitting both Gabriel Martinelli and Vinicius in the face in successive plays in the 89th minute.Five-time World Cup champions Brazil are third in the standings on 17 points, five from leaders Argentina, while Venezuela are seventh on 12 points. The top six sides are guaranteed a berth at the 2026 finals.The high-paced match saw numerous chances from both sides who registered 11 goal attempts each, with Brazil enjoying over 60% of possession but failing to turn their dominance into goals and getting often exposed to counter attacks.Off the back of successive wins against Peru and Chile, Brazil were dangerous from the start with Vinicius a constant menace, hitting the post in the 20th minute.Raphinha gave Brazil the lead, netting a fine left-footed strike from a free kick on the edge of the box in the 43rd minute that ricocheted off the left post before finding the back of the net.It was Brazil’s first goal from a free kick in over 19 years in World Cup qualifiers after former Real Madrid fullback Roberto Carlos scored also against Venezuela in 2005.But Segovia stroke an unstoppable first-effort shot from the edge of the box 38 seconds into the second half to level the game assisted by Jefferson Savarino.But Brazil kept threatening and had an opportunity to get back in front in the 62nd minute when Vinicius was fouled inside the box by goalkeeper Rafael Romo in a counter attack.However, Romo stopped Vinicius' poorly taken spot kick and the Real Madrid striker also failed to net the rebound, missing wide left of the empty goal and Venezuela held on against Brazil's late press for a winner.“It is just sad because, for me, the most important thing is to win and I think we could have won the match,” Raphinha told Brazilian TV Globo.“We knew it was going to be complicated, their team also has good qualities, but sometimes things get complicated by what happens in the match, when you fail to score the chances you have. We have to keep working to get back to winning ways.” \nHolders Ivory Coast and Equatorial Guinea became the latest countries to qualify for next year’s Africa Cup of Nations finals but did not have to kick a ball to do so, as the penultimate round of qualifiers began on Wednesday.The Ivorians, winners at the last finals which they hosted at the start of the year, are certain of finishing in the top two places in Group G after Sierra Leone were held to a 1-1 draw by Chad in Abidjan.The Ivorians sit on nine points from four matches, with Zambia second in the group on seven from four. Sierra Leone have five points with one game to play and Chad are eliminated.Chad moved the clash to the Ivory Coast because they are one of 18 countries barred from hosting international matches because of the poor state of their stadia.They went a goal behind to Abu-Diaby Dumbuya’s stunning 29th-minute effort but equalised with a Panenka-style penalty from defender Mahamat Thiam five minutes later.A 1-0 win for Liberia over Togo in Monrovia in Group E eliminated both countries and guaranteed Equatorial Guinea progress to the tournament in Morocco, which is to be played from Dec. 21, 2025 to Jan. 18, 2026. The top two sides in each of the 12 qualifying groups advance to the finals.Equatorial Guinea, who were a surprise package at the last finals, sit on seven points from their four matches, while Liberia who have four points from five games and Togo have two.Even if Liberia finish with same points tally as Equatorial Guinea, who host group leaders Algeria on Thursday, they cannot overhaul them in the standings because of the head-to-head record between the two.Equatorial Guinea beat Liberia home and away last month, but on Wednesday substitute Mohammed Sangare, who came through the ranks at Newcastle United but now plays his club football in Switzerland, tucked away an 83rd-minute penalty to ensure Liberia’s first win of the group.MAIDEN VICTORYIt was also a maiden victory for caretaker coach Thomas Kojo, drafted in last month after Romanian Mario Marinica was fired.Earlier on Wednesday, Cameroon hung on for a goalless draw away against Namibia in their Group J clash played in Johannesburg, South AfricaNamibia came close to snatching victory midway through the second half when diminutive forward Prins Tjiueza hit the upright with a header and then slammed the rebound onto the same post as Andre Onana kept a clean sheet for a fourth time in five matches in the qualifiers.Cameroon had already qualified from Group J while it was the first point of the campaign for the already-eliminated Namibia.Afterwards, Cameroon coach Marc Brys bemoaned the poor organisation which saw his side arrive less than 24 hours before kick-off and have to do without Brentford striker Bryan Mbeumo and Brighton & Hove Albion’s Carlos Baleba, who did not make it to the game on the time after playing in the Premier League at the weekend.Algeria, Equatorial Guinea, the Ivory Coast and Cameroon are joined by Angola, Burkina Faso, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt, Morocco and Senegal in the finals.More places should be decided on Thursday when a further nine qualifiers are played around the continent, with the likes of Nigeria, Sudan and Tunisia looking likely to book their tickets to Morocco. \nMilitary cooperation between Russia and North Korea amid Russia’s aggression in Ukraine is feared to have a serious impact on security conditions in East Asia, including Japan.There is a possibility that North Korea will learn techniques of modern-day warfare and Russia could provide technologies related to nuclear weapons and missiles to the country.The North Korean troops who have entered Russia are believed to be elite soldiers of special operation units. It is assumed that they will engage in urban warfare in Seoul or other large cities should a military contingency occur in the Koran Peninsula.According to South Korea’s National Intelligence Service, the North Korean troops are now learning how to control unmanned aircraft in Russia, among other things.South Korea and North Korea are only in a truce. Thus, South Korea is wary that the North’s troop deployment to Russia may help strengthen North Korea’s military capabilities.South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol openly expressed his sense of urgency at a press conference on Nov. 7 saying, “If the North Korean military acquires modern-day warfare experience, it will be a deadly problem for South Korea’s security.”If a military contingency occurs in the Korean Peninsula, Pyongyang expects Russia to become involved based on a recently ratified treaty between the two countries.It seems that Pyongyang also expects Russia, as a nuclear superpower, will provide its technologies related to nuclear weapons and missiles in exchange for North Korea’s provision of weapons and military deployment.Such an improvement of North Korea’s technological capabilities will be a serious threat to Japan and South Korea.On the other hand, China, which has backed Pyongyang, has taken a wait-and-see attitude regarding the “bilateral relationship” of Russia and North Korea as the two grow closer.But diplomatic sources in Beijing share the view that Chinese President Xi Jinping’s administration does not regard the ties favorably and views the relationship as one that could raise tensions in the Korean Peninsula.China has placed importance on North Korea’s role as “a buffer zone” against U.S. forces in South Korea and the South Korean military.Chinese military officials and other experts have expressed concern that the current situation may make “peace and stability” in the Korean Peninsula collapse, the sources added.Some in the international community are demanding that China exercise its influence on Pyongyang so that North Korea does not join Russia’s aggression.However, it is expected that Beijing will not take any substantial action since doing so may cause North Korea to lean further toward Russia.-In Association with ANN \nChaaaiiittt…The spontaneous eruption of the sound of victory thundered through the neighbourhood of Nhyokha in the Kathmandu core. The line of a kite cut another. Looking out the window of her house, Sajani Shrestha saw children running full speed, shouting and fighting as they vied to catch the falling kite and thread. And craning her neck up to the sky, she could not count but only be mesmerised by the innumerable kites strewn across the skies of Nhyokha, Bangemudha, Indrachowk. “There would be so many kites that they entirely covered the blue of the sky, making beautiful patterns of different colours,” says the 51-year-old. “And you cannot imagine the number of times the call of chait rang in the air.”Clear blue sky and gentle westerlies, the season of kites has arrived in the Kathmandu Valley. While kites soared Kathmandu's sky mainly during Dashain, the kite season officially started in Nag Panchami (August) and ended on the Haribodhini Ekadashi (November). And from royalities to commoners, young and old all flew kites from rooftops and open grounds. Even those who did not, like Sajani, revelled in the live spectacle in the sky as kites soared and fought. With Bhimsen Thapa’s help, King Girvanyuddha flies kites The earliest written account of kite flying is believed to date to 200 BC in China. In Kathmandu, this tradition has religious and socio-cultural and environmental significance, says Tina Manandhar, lecturer of Nepalese History, Culture and Archaeology at Tribhuvan University. According to her, it is believed that kites in Kathmandu skies carry a message to the god of rain Indra that the valley's farmers have had enough rain for their crops. That is why Kathmandu farmers scolded anyone flying kites before plantation season.In an article ‘Changako Utpati Ra Bikas’ published in Gorkhapatra in 1995, historian Rajesh Gautam points to the lack of written documents indicating the exact time when kite culture was introduced in Nepal. Exploring different opinions on kite's introduction to Nepal, he writes that “some have opined the possibility that the skill and tradition of kite flying might have entered Nepal through India.” Yet some others, he writes, state that kites “came to Nepal from Japan during the time of [Rana PM] Dev Shumsher.”He concludes that most likely this tradition was introduced by Malla-era Newar traders: “But since Nepal’s relationship with Tibet and China is very old and direct, kites might have entered Nepal through the Newar traders who were engaged in the trade. One can estimate that the kite was introduced to Nepal during the (mediaeval) Malla regime.”In Social History of Nepal, TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi write that there exists documented evidence of the kite flying from the early 19th century. The authors state that Sundarananda, a contemporary poet, has mentioned that the young king Girvanyuddha Bikram Shah (r.1799-1816), with the help of Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa, flew kites from the towering temple of Taleju Bhawani, Hanumandhoka. And when the king's kite cut the kites of the youngsters, they were located and rewarded with money.In Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Sardar Bhim Bahadur Pandey states that “During the month of Kartik [October-November] young and old all flew kites,” suggesting that kite culture was ubiquitous in Kathmandu by the early twentieth century.Anticipations and preparationsKite flying in Nepal requires a kite, a lattai (a wooden spool), thread and majha (homemade adhesive prepared by boiling snail slime, rice or sago, and powdered glass from burnt electric bulbs and coated on the line to sharpen it for kite fighting).77-year-old Nirmal Man Tuladhar, an avid kite flyer and retired professor of Linguistics at the Tribhuvan University, explains how Nepali tradition of kite flying was both expensive and needing advance preparation.“In our times, it wasn’t easy to fly kites,” he says. “We had to prepare majha …And as Nepali kites are fighter kites, we mainly fought with other kites [which meant we spent a lot of threads].”This preparation needed first and foremost of passing a hurdle: securing finances and materials to fly kites. While lattai was a one-time investment that could be saved for years, kites and threads had to be replenished every time a kite was cut.“Those were the times when parents wanted us to be more focused in our studies. They only gave money [to buy kites] after immense pestering,” says 80-year-old Dwarika Nath Dhungel, former Secretary of Nepal government, speaking of the 1950s and 1960s.Biodiversity specialist and botanist Tirtha Bahadur Shrestha, 86, was born in Mahabouddha and began flying kites from 1951-52. He saved what little money he got for afternoon snacks to buy Hattimar reel, a brand of line wound in a small lattai, which was strong and sharp and where majha stuck well.Raghuji Pant, a member of parliament, also recalls the difficulty in securing money to sustain his kite flying in and around Kathmandu core in the 1960s and early 1970s. “Four to five of my kites were cut in a day,” writes the 67-year-old in his 2019 article “Changa Jastai Udi Hidne Man” published in Himalkhabar. “[This caused] the line in the spool to shorten. From Bhadra [August-September] to one to one and a half months after Dashain I spent flying kites. So, it was difficult for me to have enough kites even after getting money from grandfather, grandmother, mother and everyone.”Kites and thread secured, now began the crucial work of preparing and applying majha whose strength determined how well it cut other kites. Govinda Tandon, 70, a historian and heritage expert, who grew up in Battisputali, was also an ardent kite flyer.“Materials for making majha were prepared right from the morning on a holiday,\" he writes in his article “Dashainko Butte Changa” published in Gorkhapatra. “Because this work couldn’t be accomplished without a collaboration of 3-4 friends, a holiday was set aside for this. Moreover, a sunny day was considered appropriate. If the majha didn’t dry, the thread could turn moist, and so if it felt like the day wouldn’t be sunny, the entire plan…was aborted.”Kite makers, kite sellers and variety of kites One of the oldest shops in Kathmandu's memory, Shree Chitrakar Kite Center in Tyauda, Asan is bustling with customers during Dashain. “When my grandmother got married and came to this house at age 12 [in early 1940s], this shop was already here,” says its fourth generation owner 47-year-old Dinoj Chitrakar. “So the shop must be around a hundred years old.”Another shop that stands out in Kathmandu's memory is Manandhar Kite Center in Kalimati, established in 1949, and currently run by brothers Mohan Man and Sundar Man Manandhar.In his book Antar Taranga, artist and writer Manuj Babu Mishra recalls “a kite shop near the old halwai shop of Chabahil” in the 1940s. Dhungel and his 1960 batchmates of Juddhodaya Public School recall the kite shops from the 1950s and 1960s – Bekhacha’s Shop at Netapacho, Bhaicha’s Shop at Nhyokha, Lata Manandhar’s Shop at Maru, Kanchha Buddha Bajracharya Shop at Tyauda.Besides the shops, there were makers and sellers of kites cloistered in different localities of Kathmandu Valley.In Kwalkhu, Patan was a Joshi who made Nepali paper kites.“One day I accompanied my uncle to buy kites,\" writes Dibya Giri, 69, in his 2023 article “Changa” in Sahitya Post. “I was amazed to see the huge stacks of kites there. We used to call it the house of the kite maker.”In Nhyokha, Purna Bahadur Shrestha began making kites as a teenager and started his own kite business in the 1950s, according to his daughter Sajani.These kites, made out of Nepali paper, often had different paintings. Mishra recalls painting kites for the kite shop in Chabahil.“I went to that kite shop and with the freely available colours and Nepali papers, I spent my day painting faces, birds, animals, masks, mountains, hills, whatever came to my mind,” he writes in the book. “Such kites apparently sold well!”Most septuagenarians and older generations like Tuladhar and Tirtha Bahadur recall flying kites made of Nepali paper when young. Tirtha Bahadur says that kites from Lucknow began coming to Kathmandu only after the late 1950s. But at least a section of Kathmandu was flying kites from Lucknow from the early twentieth century. Vaidya, Manandhar and Joshi write that the Ranas and Shahs imported kites from Lucknow and that from them, their favourite employees also got to fly some. These kites were large and, in Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Pande writes that they were referred to as Lucknowia kites.Known for their characteristic hissing sound they made while flying, light body, swift movement and ability to take sharp turns, Lucknow kites were preferred by kite fighters.“Lucknow kites were lighter and could be manoeuvred well,” says Tuladhar. “Kites of Nepali paper were stable but difficult to manoeuvre. They were also expensive. So only some fighters flew Nepali paper kites.”The kites had different names depending upon their designs and colours – Ambe (a heart in the centre), Dibdibe (chequered), Pakhete (a different coloured paper on one edge), Sete (white-coloured), Nilchi (blue-coloured), Rate (red-coloured) and so on.The kite fighters preferred the strong and sharp Hattimar reel that came on a small lattai. The Belchamar reel was cheaper but weaker and prone to be cut by other threads. Kite fliers and kite watchers on rooftops and open groundsBibek Shrestha, 57, and his two brothers took stacks of kites and climbed their rooftops. The rooftops around theirs in the neighbourhood of Nhyokha – in fact in all core settlements of the Valley – were filled with kite fliers and spectators. Many risked precariously balancing on the sloped roofs.While Bibek and his brothers’ kites alighted to meet the sea of kites in the sky, their sister Sajani and other family members gathered around to revel in the live spectacle.Dhungel remembers the rooftops of Jhochhen and surroundings of the 1950s and 1960s swelled with kite fliers. Dhungel did try to fly kites. But he did not become a successful kite flyer. What he did become was, like Sajani and many Kathmandu residents, an admirer of kites soaring in the sky.“But more than engaging in my unsuccessful kite flying attempts, I enjoyed looking at the kites flying. There would be a big crowd of spectators. Females and other family members watched the kites fly as they ate meat and chiura. Some even drank and rejoiced as they flew kites.”When the age of cassette player and speakers dawned in the 1980s, songs blared from the speakers alongside kite flying. Chitrakar and Bibek invited their friends, put their favourite songs on speakers and spent entire afternoons flying kites, dancing, singing and eating.Away from the core cities, in the villages in the Valley, people flew kites in open fields. Like Dibya, who set his kite for flight from the banks of Godavari River in Tikathali. Chhauni was also a popular space for flying kites.Kathmandu’s joy in kite fightingBibek pulled his kite down and then manoeuvred it back up so his line touched his opponent's line from below and quickly reeled out his line. The resulting sharpness from the speed cut the opponent's line.Chaaaiiitttt………“The greatest fun comes from cutting another kite's string,” writes Tuladhar in his 1996 article “Cutting is the greatest fun” published in magazine Kite Lines. “With its coating of adhesive paste and ground glass, the string is as sharp and abrasive as sandpaper on your opponent's line.”Nepali kite, Tuladhar says, is made to fight other kites, and describes how a kite line cuts the other.“The technique is to touch your rival's string and immediately reel out line at high speed,” he writes. “The Nepalese style of kite flying is aggressive, and though the kites look simple, they are strategically designed for bringing down other kites.”At any given time, like Bibek’s kite above Nhyokha sky, skies above the Valley were filled with raging kites, swinging, coming down and going up as the fighters reeled in and out their lattais in ferocious attempts to bring down other kites.Meanwhile spectators cheered. “Even passersby stopped to look at the kites,” recalls Tina.The moment of a kite cutting was accompanied by the sound of chait, and children ran in the direction of the falling kite to grab it and the thread in what was termed as, Dibya says, changa lutne/dhago lutne.Dhungel always joined in to shout the chait resounding through the locality of Jhochhen and almost automatically his feet sped towards the severed kites' direction.“‘Oii leave that thread,’ the kite owner would scold me. ‘Why do you pull my thread, leave it right now.’ But I’d continue pulling the threads as the owner continued shouting. Other times I caught the kites that had failed to fly and dropped on the ground.”The fallen kites got stuck in the buildings, trees or poles, or glided down in the open grounds or paddy fields. Falling kites from the Kathmandu core settled down in Tundikhel covering it. Oftentimes kites fell on the fields to rest upon the lush paddy nearing its harvest.“Children ran straight into the fields to catch the kite,” says Dibya. \"They destroyed the crops by stepping on them. Some farmers chased them, scolding along as they did so and if they caught anyone, they slapped them.”Love and restrictions on kiteAmidst the raging kite fights high up in the sky, there were apparently also some quieter kites lingering much lower among the buildings or tree lines, for their goals lay in not ruthlessly cutting the threads of other kites but piercing softly through the hearts of their owners' love interests. During the Rana regime, there were designated public spaces to fly kites, writes Gautam in his article. Referring to oral accounts, he writes that the Ranas were particularly careful to avoid kite flyers around their durbars. This is because love-stricken men tied letters to kites and flew them into the durbars to their love interests among the nanis.He writes that the kites could be flown mainly on the grounds of Chhauni. Anyone flying kites in any other place and around Rana durbars were arrested.Pant also recalls love-stricken boys from his time. “Just as kites came in different colours and patterns, so did kite flyers,” he writes in the article. “Some wrote love letters using a few words in “symbolic language” on a plain kite and attempted to land it on the rooftop of the girl they liked. Some simply landed their kites on any rooftop if a girl appeared there and waited for reaction.”King Tribhuvan among kite fliersPande writes in his book: “Once or twice during kite season every year, King Tribhuvan went to Chhauni to fly kites. Legend has it that if the line of the king’s kite was cut, it flew to Lhasa. But since anyone who caught that kite received five rupees, everyone attempted to catch that kite.”In 2021 news report ‘Bhawanle Chhekidiyo Changa Udaune Aakash’ by Shivahari Ghimire published in Nayapatrika, cultural expert the late Satyamohan Joshi also recounts that “During Dashain, Tribhuvan came to the ground below Swayambhu to fly kites. […] He did not use the same thread to fly kites twice.”In the same article, Joshi says that the King also went to Budhanilakantha to fly kites and participate in kite flying competitions.End of season, end of cultureMohan Krishna Shrestha, 86, was born in Budhanilakantha. Every year, on the day of Haribodhini Ekadashi, he saw the annual fair at the Budhanilakantha Temple. He also witnessed kite fliers gathered in the open fields around the Temple.“Oh, it’d be a lot of people,” says Shrestha. “They came from all around Bhaktapur, Kathmandu and Lalitpur.”They flew kites on Ekadashi, Dwadashi and some even until Purnima.“They took all the remaining threads and kites that had survived Dashain and flew the last kites of the season,” says Tuladhar. “I remember my uncles, relatives and neighbours going to Budhanilakantha with their kites.”Joshi recalls in the 2021 article that King Tribhuvan also went to Budhanilakantha with his sons Mahendra, Himalaya and Basundhara. He greatly supported and also participated in the competitions there organised by the commoners. If he liked he gave prize money to the winners.This annual event lost its glory days after the decline in the open fields as buildings began to rise with the establishment of Budhanilkantha School in 1972, Mohan says.“The event survived in some form until the 1990s,” he says.But what happened after that?The end-of-the-season event in the 1990s was also an indication of the end of the age-old kite tradition.“If I go to my ancestral place in Asan to fly kites, it’s not possible for me to do that today because there are buildings everywhere,” says Tuladhar. “Cityscapes and urbanisation have created the obstacle for flying kites.”Dibya does feel like flying kites sometimes.“No space to fly kites today,” he says. “In the old times, there were river banks and open fields. Even if you fly kites, it gets stuck in somebody's rooftop or water tank or somewhere.”Yesteryear’s kite enthusiasts believe that increasing means of entertainment was another reason for the decline of kite culture.“When television came, kite flying started to slowly decrease,” says Bibek. “And then mobile phones robbed kite flying even more.”And so, when his sister Sajani cranes her neck up in the sky today, she rarely sees a kite.“Those days we heard one chait after another,” she says. “These days you won’t hear a single chait.” \nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nWhat animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. \nIn Nepal’s political landscape, the same politicians remain at the centre of power for decades. Take the current Prime Minister, KP Sharma Oli, for example, who exercises near-absolute control within the CPN-UML. Many politicians express frustration with his leadership in private conversations, yet few dare challenge him. Why? Their self-interest—often tied to political appointments, election tickets and funding opportunities—prevents them from questioning his legitimacy.This, however, is not unique to the UML. Maoist Centre’s Pushpa Kamal Dahal has maintained an iron grip on his party for over 35 years, with efforts to unseat him ending the political careers of many challengers. In the Nepali Congress, Sher Bahadur Deuba has centralised support around himself, not necessarily because of his “supreme power,” but the self-interest of those around him. Nepali politicians aren’t motivated by policy or ideological alignment; they are driven by personal benefit, perpetuating a system where individual leaders dominate parties, stifling dissent and competition.Even new parties, such as the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) founded by Rabi Lamichhane, replicate these dynamics. Built around the cult of personality, Lamichhane dominates his party, much like CK Raut in the Janamat Party. Lamichhane’s party is currently protesting against his supposed “politically charged” arrest, even though he has been taken into custody for cooperatives fraud. In Kathmandu, Balen Shah’s rise is based on his public image. He has openly admired leaders like Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and American President Donald Trump and has adopted their political tactics. Such a trend suggests a dangerous pattern in Nepali politics—political power is increasingly concentrated on individuals rather than institutions. The solution lies in cultivating genuine intra-party democracy.The illusion of leadership changeThe idea of \"exit policies\" within parties like the Nepali Congress has generated some debate. Genuine democracy within parties requires more than setting a retirement age or term limits. It necessitates a political culture where leadership exits are probable because of robust internal competition. Hence, an exit policy is hardly the solution to the problem of entrenched leaders. It may push an individual out, but it does not address the broader undemocratic culture that has taken hold within Nepal's major political parties. Exit policies fail to offer a real solution because they do not change the structure or system of power within parties. We need a political culture where leadership transitions are not just probable but a constant possibility.Top leaders must realise that their position is always vulnerable—subject to internal challenges from qualified, competent alternatives. Emerging leaders who can challenge their authority should pressure them. This can be possible only if political parties stop being loyal to only a single leader. The parties must become open spaces, allowing new ideas and fresh leadership to rise. Unfortunately, none of this is currently possible in Nepal. Intra-party democracy—where there is a regular, fair and open process for leadership selection—has largely been absent from our political system.Decaying democracyHow can we expect leaders who suppress internal party democracy to champion democratic principles at the national level? The same leaders who ruthlessly crush internal opposition, cement their rule as the only viable option, and do whatever it takes to maintain power cannot be trusted to safeguard the country’s democratic values. This pattern mirrors authoritarian regimes, where leaders present themselves as the solution to all national problems.Self-interest is at the core of Nepal's political dysfunction. Leaders surround themselves with loyalists who expect political and financial rewards for their allegiance. This dynamic creates a toxic environment where factions form around personal interests rather than ideologies or policies.True democracy cannot thrive when the internal structures of its most vital institutions—political parties—are profoundly undemocratic. Power may shift from a Koirala to a Deuba or a Nepal to an Oli, but this doesn’t signify progress. These represent a reshuffling of elites rather than a fundamental shift in how power is distributed and exercised. Without dismantling the factional politics driven by self-interest, the larger democratic project remains in jeopardy.The path forwardFor democracy to be strengthened, Nepal must look inward—at the parties forming its political system's backbone. This does not necessarily mean ousting long-standing leaders like Oli, Prachanda, or Deuba and replacing one leader with another. What is needed is a transformation in how parties operate internally.Leadership should not be seen as a lifetime appointment. It needs to be accountable not only to the public but also to the very institutions it helms. Only when Nepali political parties embrace intra-party democracy can the broader political system become more democratic. This will require systemic reforms that foster transparency, competition and merit-based advancement within parties. Without these changes, Nepal’s political system will remain a breeding ground for authoritarian tendencies under the guise of democratic leadership.It’s important to recognise that the alternative to a dysfunctional democracy is not radical system change but meaningful reform. Democracy is not just about holding elections or transferring power between individuals. It is a political culture where power is not held by a small clique of people but shared, opposed and renovated.  \nAlgorithms played a vital role in determining the outcome of the 2024 US election. These invisible forces on platforms like X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and TikTok have evolved from tools meant to connect people into powerful influencing forces that determine what people see, believe, and, eventually, how they vote. If we do nothing to curtail their impact, we risk losing the democratic principles that underpin our society.The social media recommendation algorithms that control our social media feeds are designed to keep people engaged, but they have now become extremely sophisticated and play a central role in shaping public discourse. If a post goes viral, the algorithms decide that more people should see it. People are unaware that an invisible force is shaping political conversation and decisions.As the election approached, these algorithms didn’t treat all the content equally. Platforms like X and Facebook seem to reward posts that stir anger, fear, or outrage. Unlike thought-out perspectives, such posts spread like wildfire, leading to heated online public discourse. Algorithms widened the gap in an already divided political climate in the US and made it difficult for people to get authentic and truthful content. However, the influence of AI went beyond algorithms. During the campaign, generative AI tools capable of creating hyper-realistic deepfake content designed to mislead voters flooded social media. Even the fact-checkers could not keep up with the speed of such artificial intelligence techniques. To make matters worse, the social media algorithms implied these viral posts, further confusing the voters. Traditionally, social media posts seemed to favour Democrats; however, as Elon Musk acquired X, the algorithms were made more transparent but also unpredictable. The more right-leaning posts started to receive visibility, sparking concerns about social media platform's role in shaping the political discourse. Worse, Musk’s tweets and retweets were confusing and more right-leaning, and they were amplified by the platform in the country, which has an extremely polarised political atmosphere. This amplification of algorithm-driven partisan content to increase high engagement changed how people voted in elections. Political advertisements, viral posts and fake news stories were tailored to specific groups based on psychological profiles, increasing biases and fears. As a result, it was extremely hard for regular people to have rational, cross-ideological dialogue. Simply put, people were flooded with information and could not make rational decisions. The global reach of social media platforms further complicated things. These platforms aren’t just serving domestic audiences in the United States. Foreign actors are also using them to influence voters. Before the election, US intelligence officials reported that adversaries from Russia and elsewhere had deployed AI-driven tools to manipulate voters in key swing states. Deepfake videos flooded the internet, exploiting the same algorithm designed to amplify viral content, which made disinformation campaigns more effective.There have been efforts to curb misinformation, but the impact has been low. Social media platforms started using AI tools to detect and limit misleading content, but these tools failed to recognise new forms of deception, especially as bad actors were quick to refine their tactics. AI-driven content will only become more sophisticated; distinguishing fact from fiction will become harder.The most troubling part of this new reality is the growing sense of powerlessness it creates. Already overwhelmed by the constant flow of information, voters find themselves at the mercy of algorithms that shape their worldview. The foundation of democratic decision-making erodes when misinformation spreads unchecked. The line between truth and falsehood gets blurred in this new environment, leaving helpless voters to navigate a political landscape that has become more of a maze than a space for rational debates. Fixing this newfound problem of algorithmic manipulation in politics is challenging. Advocates are calling for platforms to disclose how their recommendation systems work and take responsibility for the negative consequences. However, transparency alone might not be enough to tackle this problem. AI is evolving and becoming more complex, which means full transparency could still leave many questions unanswered. Another suggestion is for the government to regulate social media algorithms. But this also comes with significant challenges as it may stifle innovation or inadvertently create political biases, making it harder for people to express their views freely. Striking the right balance between protecting the integrity of public discourse and preserving freedom of speech will be a major challenge in future. Nepal should start thinking along this line. This issue ultimately boils down to voter responsibility. To combat the effects of algorithmic manipulation, people must have good judgment skills regarding the information they consume. Digital literacy, the ability to understand how algorithms work and how they shape what we see, will be crucial for future elections. Voters must know how algorithms influence their perceptions and critically evaluate the information that floods their feeds. As Dr Srinivas Mukkamala, a cybersecurity expert, notes, “The first step to regaining control is understanding the game that is being played.”The 2024 US election was just a reminder of the risks and dangers of the growing influence of algorithms on the political system. Moving forward, the role of social media and AI in shaping democracy will only continue to increase. If we want to preserve the integrity of our elections and ensure that public debate remains grounded in truth, the algorithms that shape our political landscape must be tamed. The question, however, isn’t just who controls these systems but how we, as a society, choose to manage and mitigate their influence for the good of democracy. \nDuring my tenure in the National Assembly, I championed a resolution to protect the rights of provincial and local governments and to ensure the effective implementation of federalism. This resolution addressed 15 critical areas requiring the attention of the Government of Nepal, with the first point urging the activation of intergovernmental relations (IGR) entities, such as the National Coordination Council (NCC) and the Interprovince Council. On June 2, 2022, the Assembly discussed and unanimously endorsed this resolution, instructing the government to take action.According to the Federation, Province and Local Level Coordination and Inter-Relation Act, 2020 (IGR Law), the NCC, chaired by the prime minister, chief ministers and local government representatives, serves as a vital platform for resolving intergovernmental issues. Despite this provision, the NCC had not convened even once since the law’s enactment. The resolution prioritised this, recognising the importance of activating these IGR entities to address federal issues.Following the Assembly’s directive, the then Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal convened the NCC’s first meeting on July 1, 2023. This was a significant development, but the journey had just begun. Following this, the Assembly established a seven-member ‘Federalism Implementation Study and Monitoring Parliamentary Special Committee’. The Committee was tasked with examining all aspects of federalism implementation, including political, fiscal, administrative and structural challenges. In four months, it recommended 99 action points across 11 thematic areas, such as fiscal federalism, administrative federalism, intergovernmental relations and service delivery to strengthen federalism implementation.The first recommendation called for revising the “Unbundling Exercise.” While the Constitution delineates functional responsibilities among federal, provincial and local governments, ambiguities in the initial unbundling exercise have led to overlapping and duplicated responsibilities. After five years of federalism, the committee noted the pressing need to re-evaluate the exercise to clarify responsibilities among all levels of government. Consequently, the committee instructed the Office of the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers (OPMCM) to initiate this task and complete it within six months. Dahal, attending the National Assembly session, assured that he would follow the Committee’s recommendations, including revising the unbundling exercise.Following the repeated pressure from the National Assembly, the NCC’s meeting in July last year marked a turning point as it decided to amend the unbundling exercise. Among the six key decisions, the second was to form a nine-member committee led by the Secretary of Provincial Coordination at the OPMCM to clarify functional responsibilities across government levels. The committee was instructed to complete its work within six months.In addition to this committee, the OPMCM, with approval at the prime minister’s level, created five specialised task forces in the economic, administrative, social, legal and infrastructure sectors. The relevant secretary headed each task force, including sectoral experts and federal ministry representatives. These committees conducted in-depth reviews in their assigned fields. Representatives from the Municipal Association of Nepal and the National Association of Rural Municipalities in Nepal participated and helped organise feedback and consultation programmes across provinces.A significant meeting took place last year in Hetauda, where all seven provincial Chief Ministers and representatives from local government associations gathered to discuss the unbundling exercise. They later submitted their report to the OPMCM for further review. A high-level expert team, including specialists in federalism, administration, law, finance and infrastructure, was assembled to ensure a thorough analysis. The expert team prepared reports on five subject areas to analyse and recommend adjustments to the unbundling exercise, which the OPMCM compiled. But the approval from the NCC still remains pending.The National Coordination Council meeting on July 1, 2023, originally mandated the completion and submission of the unbundling exercise within six months, with the understanding that a second meeting would convene for its review. After continued pressure from lawmakers and the Special Parliamentary Committee’s recommendations for federalism, the second Coordination Council meeting finally took place on February 7, 2024. The NCC reiterated its commitment to fulfilling decisions from its first meeting, with clear, time-bound directives to ensure progress. However, these decisions, including the approval of the unbundling exercise, have yet to be executed. While the Council’s decision to revise the exercise was a major achievement, the lack of implementation limits its impact. Once approved, the report is expected to streamline intergovernmental functions, reduce conflicts and enhance the performance of all three governments.Clarifying government responsibilities The 2015 Constitution defines functional responsibilities for each level of government, establishing areas for ‘self-rule’ and ‘shared governance’. However, these responsibilities remain ambiguous and often overlap across federal, provincial and local governments. In 2017, Nepal conducted an initial unbundling exercise to clarify roles and avoid conflicts. Despite these efforts, provincial and local governments continue to raise concerns, citing that the federal government often disregards the delineated responsibilities established through unbundling. Issues have emerged in planning, budgeting, lawmaking, fiscal transfers, administrative management and public order, where the federal government seems to be encroaching upon the autonomy of provincial and local governments. Local governments also report grievances about provincial governments, noting interference that hinders effective local governance.Sectoral overlap is evident in almost every domain—roads, drinking water, irrigation, education and agriculture. This leads to resource strains and service delivery inefficiencies. For instance, local road projects, which local authorities should ideally manage, often receive funding and direction from all government tiers. Federal agencies frequently allocate budgets for minor city roads, while provincial governments intervene in local infrastructure. Consequently, local governments manage projects shaped by federal and provincial funding or priorities, complicating planning, accountability and responsiveness to local needs. These challenges have sparked a call from sub-federal governments for a comprehensive review of the 2017 unbundling exercise. Revisiting this exercise to eliminate overlaps, establish clear guidelines and empower each government level according to its constitutional roles could prevent redundancy, improve accountability and enhance service delivery. Ultimately, clearer boundaries and responsibilities would benefit the people by ensuring government actions are coordinated and responsive to local needs.While the unbundling exercise has seen substantial progress, it remains unfinished and unapproved by the National Coordination Council. This delay raises critical questions: Where is the Unbundling Exercise? Why are local government associations and provincial leaders silent about its completion? The success of federalism hinges on clarifying and respecting each government level's roles and responsibilities. The delayed approval of the exercise continues to hinder the effective functioning of federalism in Nepal. \nNepal is increasingly under the siege of the adverse effects of climate change. This year too the country witnessed the monsoon continuing beyond the end of the normal monsoon season, flooding the country until late September. Similarly, in August, the glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) in Solukhumbu district swept away several houses and displaced 135 people in Thame village, a prominent destination in the Everest region. The fears about climate change seem to be coming true. Unfortunately, the worst is yet to come, with the Himalayas projected to reach the ‘peak GLOF risk’ by 2050, according to the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD). The Conference of the Parties (COP), the annual global platform on climate change, has provided developing countries with the opportunities to discuss the issue, negotiate compensation and demand accountability for the impacts of climate change with developed countries whose carbon emissions disproportionately drive global warming. As a negligible contributor to carbon emissions and among the most vulnerable countries to climate change, Nepal will conduct a high-level session on climate change under President Ram Chandra Paudel’s leadership in Baku, Azerbaijan today. The country’s agenda for COP-29 includes protecting its Himalayas, securing committed climate finance, improving access to climate funds and asking for the quick operation of the loss and damage fund established last year. Yet, a big question remains: Can Nepal’s leaders effectively convey these urgent needs at COP, and will these discussions lead to concrete action back home?Domestically, Nepal’s climate policies are often sidelined due to political inaction. The Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) should be updated to reflect developing climate scenarios and national priorities. Yet, from 2020 to 2023, Nepal’s NDCs remained stalled. Only last year was an updated version, also called the second NDC, finally approved. However, this leaves us less time to progress before countries submit updated NDCs by 2025. Moreover, in successive COPs, Nepal’s representatives have failed to make their case convincingly, reducing such conferences to formalities. The developed countries, for their part, meet, discuss and commit but fail to reduce the impacts of climate change by mitigating the use of fossil fuels. There are also concerns that Donald Trump, as the new American president, could pull the US out of the Paris Agreement, as he did in his last tenure. This will further dampen the spirit of such conferences. Despite such challenges, Nepal should continue to strongly raise its voice for compensation for low-carbon-emitting countries. It must also join hands and speak with one voice with other developing countries facing adverse effects of climate change. This year’s COP is focused on climate finance, but as important is securing firm commitments from high-emission countries to reduce their fossil fuel dependency. Without behaviour changes alongside financial support, progress will remain limited. Developing countries should consistently monitor these commitments; multilateral agencies like the United Nations, often criticised for toothlessness, should heed their concerns by holding developed nations to a higher sense of accountability. Last year, Nepal’s climate concerns received global exposure with UN Secretary-General António Guterres’s call for serious attention toward the Himalayas and the nation. Ahead of this year’s conference, Paudel and Guterres briefly discussed climate change issues during their journey to Baku, Azerbaijan. Failing to capitalise on this attention or underplaying Nepal’s role at the conference would be a missed opportunity with lasting repercussions. Our climate leaders can make much more of the COP platform to protect lives and livelihoods at home. \nExactly a year ago, the then Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government banned TikTok after introducing the ‘Directives on the Operation of Social Networking 2023’. Many considered this an attack on freedom of expression. Just when people seemed to have grown accustomed to the ban, the current KP Sharma Oli-led government lifted the nine-month restriction on the platform on August 22. Last week, TikTok finalised its registration process in line with the 2023 directives. With the video-sharing platform officially registered and operational in the country, the debate around it seems to have subsided. But how does registration make the platform better, and why was the ban implemented so suddenly if it was going to be reversed just as swiftly?According to the Internet Service Providers Association, TikTok accounted for nearly 40 percent of the country’s internet bandwidth, with around 2.2 million users in Nepal before the ban. Unlike countries like India, which decided to ban TikTok citing privacy and security concerns, the intent of “stopping and curbing social ills and anarchy” was the sole reason highlighted by the Nepali government while banning it last year. Previously, the government stated that registration was necessary due to a rise in user complaints and the absence of company representatives in the country, which made it challenging to address concerns. Now, although our laws apply to TikTok within our territory, it remains unclear how action will be taken against legal violations. In fact, the regulations in place are not sufficient and clear enough for proper implementation. The Electronic Transaction Act, 2063 (2008) does not address specific cyber-related crimes and emerging threats such as revenge porn and online prostitution. Further, the 2023 directives specify that the point of contact must identify content that violates the guidelines, such as material promoting obscenity, vulgarity, or hate speech. However, these terms are left open to interpretation, as they lack clear definitions.Although the Cyber Bureau can collaborate with TikTok to take action, a recent Post report revealed that the bureau is critically understaffed and underfunded, with only 106 personnel. Among the staff, only a few are capable of solving cases, while the remaining ones are given administrative duties. What’s intriguing is that TikTok alone was scrutinised and banned, although the directives mandate that all social media platforms register with the Ministry of Information and Communication Technology. The video-sharing platform is only the third company to register with the ministry in Nepal after Viber and WeChat. According to the prime minister, social media platforms must be treated equally, so why are Facebook, X and Instagram, with 10.58 million, 4.66 million and 3.60 million users, respectively, allowed to operate without registration?The Australian government recently announced a ban preventing children under 16 from using social media, a decision that was met with harsh criticism. Meanwhile, in Bangladesh, the interim government’s repeal of the draconian Cyber Security Act—previously used to curb press freedom—was widely welcomed. These examples show that countries around the world are experimenting and finding ways to address the challenges of a rapidly evolving digital landscape. Social media platforms are interconnected and constantly shifting, with features like short-form videos, once unique to TikTok, now available across other platforms. This suggests banning platforms may not be the most practical way to address social media’s negative aspects. Rather than relying on populist measures, our government should invest in digital literacy and research to create thoughtful, viable regulations. Moreover, the law should apply to all rather than randomly selected platforms.  \nEven at the best of times, there is no shortage of irritants in Nepal-India relations. It would be wise for the governments of both the countries not to add to the list. Yet that is not how India sees things. For over three months, the southern neighbour has stopped importing most categories of Nepali goods. The reason is that the manufacturers of these products don’t have the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) certificates. These certificates supposedly guarantee that the products India imports are of high quality. Yet it is an open secret that when New Delhi imposed mandatory certification in 2020, it did so to stop the import from the neighbourhood of all goods with Chinese components. A related problem is that Indian inspection teams have not visited the Nepali factories in order to certify their products, even months after these factories applied for the certification. This new episode of import restriction raises many questions.For example, why have the imports been stopped now even though the BIS certificates were made mandatory in 2020? How can India stop the import of goods with Chinese components when even Indian manufacturers—be they pharmaceutical companies or steel plants—would come to a halt without the import of raw material from China? India agreed to help build a standard certification lab in Nepal, way back in 2009. Why hasn’t the lab been set up yet? And at a time when India-China relations are reported to be warming up thanks to the breakthrough in their border talks, why continue to take such a rigid position on the import of goods with Chinese components? In informal talks, the decision-makers in New Delhi tend to pass the buck to the lower level functionaries when such issues are raised. For instance, the latest restrictions on imports of goods is apparently not in line with New Delhi’s policies; it is the Indian custom officials and other bureaucrats who are putting up the hurdles. There is some truth in this argument. Of late India is so occupied with big powers like the US, China and Russia, the Indian political leadership has little time for smaller countries in the neighbourhood. They thus ‘delegate’ the handling of these countries to junior bureaucrats and spies. But if so, it is a disastrous policy. India will struggle to be a credible actor on the global stage if it first cannot establish such credibility in its own neighbourhood. We have already seen the dangers of New Delhi’s excess reliance on bureaucrats to handle regional affairs, most recently in Bangladesh. When students there rose up in arms, the Indian political leadership was caught off guard. Perhaps because of this neglect of the neighbourhood, India’s old ‘backyard’ is slowly slipping out of its control. It won’t be an exaggeration to say that if the Indian political leadership wants, this issue of import restrictions can be solved overnight. Really, why would they let small irritants snowball into a full-blown crisis? In Nepal’s case, India must understand that the landlocked country has no option but to import at least some raw material and expertise from China. Making such imports is in no way tantamount to Nepal going into ‘Chinese hands’ as some hyperventilating Indian TV anchors like to put it. That is impossible given the multi-dimensional connectivity between Nepal and India. India has long since shaken off its British shackles, but as Nepali manufacturers and exporters now aver, rightly or not, the colonial hangover remains.   \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli is preparing to visit China in the first week of December. It will be his first bilateral visit after assuming the office in mid-July. Nepali prime ministers generally go to New Delhi first. Sudheer Sharma, former editor-in-chief of Kantipur daily, has recently published a pair of books on Nepal-China relations—‘Himalpari ko Huri’ and ‘Bhikshu, Byapar ra Bidroha’. He also frequently writes on Nepal’s relations with its two big neighbours. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Sharma on the eve of Oli’s China visit. Prime Minister Oli is all set to visit China next month. Many find it curious that he decided to go to Beijing first before visiting New Delhi. How do you see this development?Traditionally, Nepali prime ministers have given high priority to visits and engagements with our two neighbours–India and China. This is natural. Generally, the prime ministers first visited India and then went to China. I believe Prime Minister Oli tried to do the same. We see regular engagements with New Delhi at various levels. Prime Minister Oli had met his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York in the last week of September. In August, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba visited India and met Prime Minister Modi and her counterpart S Jaishankar, among other key officials there. But Delhi has yet to extend the invitation to the prime minister. So he seems to have decided not to defer his foreign visits for long and chose to visit Beijing first. We have to see this in two perspectives. Prime Minister Oli is visiting China at the invitation of Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang and he is also going to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping. Even in the past, Oli developed good relations with Chinese leaders. So, there are expectations that he may make the visit fruitful. An equally important concern is whether this visit impacts our relations with the southern neighbour India. I think the prime minister should focus on implementing the agreements reached during his previous visits to Beijing and during Chinese leaders’ Nepal visits. He should be mindful of not irking the southern neighbour while reaching any agreement with the northern one. I believe the prime minister is conscious of this.India often seems anxious about Chinese involvement in Nepal. Do you see any risk of this visit increasing the distance between Oli and India?Maoist leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal visited China first after he became prime minister in 2008. Even in the past, some Nepali prime ministers including Tanka Prasad Acharya went to China on their first official visit. This is not unusual. The two prime ministers—Oli and Modi—recently met in New York. India doesn’t seem ready to intensify bilateral engagements with Nepal immediately. So it is natural for the prime minister to increase engagements with China, without taking any steps that could provoke India. We should stop seeking Indian signals when dealing with China, and vice versa. We should maintain parallel relations with both the neighbours without antagonising any side.In this context, what should be the prime minister’s priorities during his China visit?We have to end our chronic problem of signing agreements and not implementing them. We make announcements and forget them. There are also some infrastructure projects China pledged to develop but there is little progress. So the prime minister should draw the Chinese leadership’s attention and press them to complete the projects on time. Some important projects such as Mugling-Pokhara and Narayanghat-Butwal road upgradation by the Chinese side have been slow, causing hardships to people. Even such issues should be communicated to the political level. Also, there are several commitments made by the Chinese government but left unimplemented. This creates an impression that China makes big promises but doesn’t keep them. Prime Minister Oli often highlights the Tokha-Chhahare road upgrade project under Chinese support but there is no satisfactory progress. Progress on preparing the detailed project report (DPR) on Nepal-China cross-border railway is unclear as well. Nepal expected some substantive support from China to make the Pokhara international airport financially feasible. Some concrete steps are needed to operate this airport. There are reports that the government has requested China to convert the loan taken to develop the airport into a grant and the prime minister will push for this during his visit. It will be an achievement if the prime minister succeeds in this. In the course of writing your recent books, you extensively interacted with Chinese officials and experts, as well as with their Nepali counterparts. What are the major factors delaying the projects? Is it lack of preparation on the Nepali side or is there any problem on the Chinese side?First, we [Nepalis] sign agreements but don’t work seriously to implement them. This is true in the case of agreements with other countries as well. We are negligent. Red tape is another problem. Third, China gives less priority to small countries like Nepal as it has so many big issues with other countries. We have to constantly follow up with them to speed things up. In the past, the two sides agreed to open more border points. This should be expedited. The people-to-people relations on the border areas were historically based on social interactions at the community level. People used to trade, marry those from the other side and interact in various ways. Of late, despite progress on infrastructure development, social engagement has been hindered. This should be rectified and new border points should be opened at Dolpa, Mustang, Gorkha, Dolakha, Taplejung, and Sankhuwasabha. We should think beyond the Capital-centric approach. This will help strengthen relations at the people’s level and give alternatives in our connectivity. We should put connectivity at the core of our relations with the two neighbours. In the past decade, we have made good progress in improving connectivity with India. A study report has been prepared on the Raxaul-Kathmandu railway project. We are building an expressway linking Kathmandu and the southern belt of the country. Integrated check posts (ICPs) have come into operation along Nepal-India border points. Cross border electricity transmission lines have been built and we have increased energy trade with India. We have thus progressed in deepening connectivity with India. We lack reliable north-south highways. Therefore, the prime minister should make connectivity a major agenda of his China visit. Given the lacklustre performance of past projects, can we be optimistic about big cross-border infra projects under Chinese help?Nepal and China have committed to run some projects under the Trans-Himalayan Multi Dimensional Connectivity Network (THMDCN) concept. A key component of this concept is to upgrade connectivity between Kathmandu and Kerung that includes roads as well as a railway. The concept also envisions operating other border points. The railway project requires more study and investment and needs to consider various other factors. For now, we should prioritise opening the aforementioned border points. The Korala border point at Mustang has huge potential. Nepal is making a road that connects Mustang with the Sunauli border point with India. Centuries ago, people from Banaras used to travel to Tibet via Mustang through this route. It can be revived and made a trilateral trade route between Nepal, India and China. Similarly, Limi in Humla, Olangchugola in Taplejung, among others places, can be developed as alternative routes. As far as Kerung-Kathmandu connection is concerned, let’s first give priority to building a reliable highway. The railway project should be developed with a broader understanding between Nepal, India and China. Beijing will develop such a big project only with the big Indian markets in mind. More importantly, there are some signs of improvements in India-China relations. We have to use this as an opportunity.There are differences in the way we work and the Chinese do and there are systemic and linguistic differences as well. These factors are often blamed for lack of progress in development activities carried out with Chinese support. Can Nepalis work closely with Chinese, just like we do with Indians?Until a decade ago, several projects developed under Indian support were left in limbo. In 2015, India imposed a blockade against Nepal and that sparked anti-India sentiment. Then, India expedited several projects. This drastic change became possible as the political leadership in India realised its mistake and showed the commitment to improve things.But the same thing is not happening with China because there is a “great wall” between Nepal and China when it comes to understanding each other. The Chinese haven’t understood Nepali context. The northern neighbour should be more open and liberal in helping Nepal. Second, Nepal should also stop approaching China only when our relations with India sour. We have left this impression on the Chinese psyche. First, we should be clear about what exactly we want from China, forge consensus among major political forces and hold talks with the Chinese leaders. Then, we should be equally committed to implementing the agreements reached this way. People now take announcements of building big projects under Chinese support as propaganda. Therefore, this time the prime minister should stress on pushing the pending projects. The prime minister should tell them that even the projects announced during President Xi’s visit have not progressed and that has created a bad impression of China in Nepal.There are some differences between the coalition partners—the CPN-UML and the Nepali Congress—about the funding modality of projects under the Belt and Road Initiatives (BRI). Do you think this may cause a problem?The UML wants to expedite the BRI projects while the Congress has insisted that we should accept only grants and not loans under the BRI. The prime minister should clear such dilemmas and come up with common views before he leaves for Beijing. Once they come up with a common view on such key issues, it will give a positive and strong message. The Chinese side will take it more seriously because the strong government led by the two largest parties can implement bilateral agreements.We have instances of Nepal’s political parties standing for and against important projects funded by other countries. This was seen in the case of the US-funded Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), and China’s BRI. Moreover, in the past, the Chinese leaders created an impression that they preferred working with communist parties and leaders. This is neither in the interest of Nepal nor of China.There are also discussions on signing the BRI implementation plan during the visit. What are the things Nepal should be careful about while signing BRI-related agreements?Trying to get grants instead of loans is in itself good. But there is no need to be prejudiced against the BRI per se. Nepal reportedly wants to include some points specifying waivers in specific projects. We should be very careful while signing project-based agreements. For instance, what will be the conditions and funding modality of a project, will it be developed under grants or loans etcetera. All our technical experts and other brains should be engaged while signing project-based agreements and specifying conditions and other nitty-gritty to ensure that we will not have unnecessary liability and debt burden in the future. Over time, Nepal has rightly adopted a steadfast position saying that we don’t join a strategic alliance proposed by any country. It stayed away from the US government’s State Partnership Programme (SPP) and China’s Global Security Initiative (GSI) as well as from India’s security umbrella. But we can’t be isolated in development initiatives. We have to take support from India, China, the US and other countries based on our needs.Do you think the Chinese side will show magnanimity on Nepal’s requests, for instance on waiving off the loan to develop Pokhara international airport?Though the Chinese ambassador to Nepal last year claimed the airport project to be under the BRI, the case is different because it was signed years before we joined the BRI. And, converting that loan into a grant is not a big deal for China. They should show magnanimity given the support we have been providing to China for a long time. If you see things historically, Nepal has helped China by suppressing Khampa revolt, preventing free Tibet movements on our soil and showing a steadfast commitment to One-China policy. China, which is now prosperous, should definitely show magnanimity and waive off loan of Pokhara airport. They shouldn’t see relations with Nepal through a purely transactional lens.In your book, you describe 2008 as a watershed after which the engagements between Nepal and China increased drastically. But why couldn’t we benefit from the northern neighbour in terms of development?The Chinese side looks more interested in increasing engagement. They like to showcase their development before foreigners. But more than lavish hospitality, we need substantive support from the neighbour, which has emerged as the world’s second-largest economy. But we should be clear about what we want from our engagements with China.  The Nepali side doesn’t present its proposals clearly. On certain issues, our politicians give mixed signals. This time, if this government of two largest parties reaches a certain agreement with China and remains committed to implement it, other forces can’t hinder it. The same approach can be replicated while dealing with India, the US, Japan or other friendly countries.Is difficult geography still a barrier in developing cross-border infrastructure projects and deepening relations between Nepal and China?In our textbooks we read that the Himalayan range is a natural barrier between the two countries. In my book ‘Bhikshu Byapar ra Bidroha’, I have explored and described how people from Nepal and northern India had been traversing through these mountains and there were interactions and engagements between the people in this part of the world since the 5th and 6th centuries. So, the mountains weren’t barriers even at that time. Now technology has made things easier. We have to think about how to connect with these two big economies. We have multiple east-west highways. Now we need north-south highways connecting the three countries that will help us reap benefits from India and China.At present, relations between these two countries have improved and it is an opportunity for us. We have to forge understanding with both India and China if we have to materialise big projects based on trilateral agreement. One thing we can’t accept is the concept of two-plus-one (India, China plus Nepal). That is unacceptable because it downgrades Nepal to a junior partner. We need trilateral agreements to develop mega connectivity-related and other investment projects but such agreements should be made on an equal-footing between the three countries. \nFormer chief election commissioner Bhojraj Pokharel successfully conducted the first Constituent Assembly election in 2008. He resigned from the position in 2009, after which he dedicated himself in the study of national and international politics. The Secretary-General of the United Nations appointed him to serve on several high-level panels—for Bangladesh’s 2008 parliamentary elections and for South Sudan’s referendum process in 2010-11. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Pokharel to better understand Nepal’s own electoral system and the influence of big business on its political parties.The latest episode of Bhatbhateni Supermarket owner Min Bahadur Gurung providing land to CPN-UML and his announcement of a sophisticated party office building at the land has of late been a topic of hot debate. People see this as an example of how politicians and businessmen work in collusion. How do you see it?Our legal provisions in this connection have some loopholes. The law allows political parties to collect donations to run their organisations, to contest elections and to carry out other activities. The law is silent on who can make such donations and how much they can do it. This is a gap in our law. Our political parties have for long been misusing the loopholes, and now they are doing so openly. The laws have also identified some sources of income for the parties such as the levy by their members, donations they get and the incomes the parties make in various ways. The amount they earn from these sources is negligible. But most major corruption cases, and mainly policy-related corruption, are linked to those who fund the political parties. This in turn is linked to the trend of elections increasingly becoming expensive. Politicians need money and those with money need access to powerful politicians. So, this is mutually beneficial for politicians and businesspeople. Such activities have been taking place for decades, but the level of such collusion has increased significantly of late.Is accepting donations from Gurung problematic as there are pending corruption and fraud cases against him or is accepting donations from business people inherently questionable?Our law hasn’t set clear criteria in this connection. Laws in some countries have categorically defined certain fundamental things such as from whom parties can take donations, how much and what type of money they can accept and how to make the deal transparent. In developed democracies, political financing is strictly monitored and regulated. In our case, we didn’t even fix the limit of the amount a businessperson can donate to a political party and whether that should be linked to the profit and tax the person pays to the state. Even the individuals who haven’t paid tax to the state citing losses in their businesses might be donating big sums to political parties or individual politicians. Therefore, there should be certain criteria to regulate political financing. Certain provisions empower the Election Commission to take action. For instance, if someone wants to help a political party or a candidate financially with more than Rs25,000, the person has to give the money through a bank. The commission can cancel someone’s candidacy or take other actions if the candidate is found to have made excessive expenses in breach of election laws. But our agencies are weak in terms of enforcement. The political parties submit the details of their financial transactions but that is often audited by a chartered accountant who might be a party cadre. The Election Commission hasn’t succeeded in investigating such malpractices. Will a law on conflict of interest help control such malpractices?We need a couple of things soon. First, the state should formulate and enforce a law on conflict of interest. It will define certain issues on conflict of interest involving politicians, business people and other stakeholders and make the officials making decisions accountable. Second, there is a need to define what are policy decisions and what aren’t. Of late, there is tendency of making decisions from Cabinet meetings to avoid prosecution from the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) as the anti-corruption body is not allowed to investigate Cabinet’s policy decisions. The CIAA leadership has an excuse not to get involved in the decisions of the politicians who appoint them. All Cabinet decisions are not policy decisions. So, it has become urgent to define what are policy decisions and what aren’t and what kind of issues the CIAA and other investigating agencies can investigate.People in general say that corruption has of late increased. Is that the case?There is no society completely free of corruption. I have been observing the functioning of our state mechanisms for the past five decades. During the Panchayat [1960-1990], everything was controlled by the palace. And, the royals and their kin were linked when there was a high-level corruption case. In the 1980s, a corruption case involving the procurement of a Boeing surfaced. A commission led by a Supreme Court justice showed the involvement of prince Gyanendra [who later became King] but its report was not implemented as the then King Birendra didn’t muster the courage to take action against his own brother. At the time, politicians didn’t dare to get involved in serious corruption cases as there was a fear of action from the palace. Over time, the volume of corruption increased with the increment in the amount of financial transactions. There is corruption even in countries like Japan and South Korea that have made exemplary progress in development. Leaders including prime ministers, ministers have been prosecuted and even faced jail terms on corruption charges. Based on that, some argue that corruption is somehow attached to development because there is mobilisation of huge resources. But there is a big difference with what is happening here. There, they take action against whoever is involved. Presidents and prime ministers have been jailed, some have even committed suicide. But in our case, top political leadership is not prosecuted. The other aspect is that after the reinstatement of democracy and the start of the republican order, the media made more corruption cases public, which was not the case during the King’s regime.Do you see any connection between the political parties and the rampant corruption in recent decades?Our party organisations became too burdensome. In developed democracies, political parties become active when there is a need for their role. At other times, they go ‘into hibernation’. The party leaders and members return to their regular businesses and remain busy there. For instance, at present, the Democrats and Republicans in the US have concentrated all their energy to help their respective candidates win. Once the election is over, they return to their regular businesses. Similar is the situation in other developed democracies. This happens when a democracy attains maturity. Conversely, in our case, the cadres are totally dependent on their organisations. And even general people want things done through party channels. From the grassroots to the centre, people go to party offices for recommendations to get something done from government agencies. This is how parties have become parallel power centres to the state agencies. The government bodies have been weakened. Hence, the way our political organisations, their leaders and cadres are managed has become the source of corruption. And it has weakened elected governments because they aren’t allowed to work independently. Government officials are also forced to work as per the order given by a head of the local chapter of a political party, not by the elected representatives with people’s mandate.There is another more concerning trend. These days the government’s decisions are influenced by certain interest groups that have huge money. There are around two dozen big business houses who influence the state’s decision-making process no matter which party leads the government. First they make informal decisions on certain key issues. Then, the Parliament, a government agency, or a court, whichever is concerned, endorses it. So now the real power doesn’t lie with elected representatives or state agencies. The interest groups wield real power.How to stop it?The state should fund political parties to cover their genuine expenses such as election expenditures and regular costs needed to run party organisations. This helps break the nexus between politicians and business tycoons and to check corruption. Once the political parties get money from state coffers, their expenditures will be strictly regulated by the law. They won’t be allowed to take outside donations. After that, the Office of the Auditor General will audit their accounts.But how can we ensure the parties and their leaders are taking no donations even after they get state funding?The law will bar both the donors and recipients from being involved in offering and taking donations. Then, the donors can say that they can’t give money to the political parties as that will be a crime of breaching the law. The policy only works if the state agencies strongly enforce the law.Other countries have made huge progress in terms of development despite corruption being rampant there. Why do we lag behind?We adopted the form of governance that accepts Parliament as the most sovereign body. But, in reality, the power lies with the chiefs of three major parties. The Parliament rubber stamps whatever they decide. And, they are influenced by certain interest groups. The legislature seeks political parties’ decisions even to follow its procedures. The other most powerful institution as per our constitution is the prime minister. But, in reality, the prime minister always struggles to appease coalition partners. Another important state pillar is the judiciary, which has been weakened by politicisation. Constitutional bodies could have played an important check and balance role but the politicians wanted to use them to serve their interests. With the weakening and non-functioning of state agencies, misrule prevails. In other countries, laws and state agencies work, and therefore they progressed.Is there a viable way to clean up our corrupt system? First the leaders that messed things up and brought the country to this situation should retire. The leaders who led historic political movements have failed to maintain their height. The narrative of ‘there is no hope’ has spread. This will not stop unless the present leadership retires. Things will improve if they voluntarily retire from politics. But they aren’t ready for that.How do you evaluate the present government’s performance after its 100 days in office?I was optimistic at the beginning and expected that they would work differently and instil hope in the people, mainly on good governance. But they gave continuity to the same mistakes they committed in the past. As the two largest parties are in the government, they have a chance to sow hope in the country, but the signs in the past 100 days aren’t encouraging. They deserve credit for the initiative to amend transitional justice related laws and to begin the process to constitute the two TJ bodies. Also, the government successfully restored connection of the Kathmandu Valley with other parts of the country after the devastating floods and landslides.Our major concern is that if this experiment of a government of two largest parties fails, it will raise questions over our system. It won’t be limited to the failure of the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, it will be projected as a failure of the system. A number of groups are unhappy with the system the present constitution adopted in 2015. The governing parties’ failure will give them a ground to raise questions over the system, at a time when a large section of the society is fed up with seeing “the same old faces”. Individual leaders’ failure may push our democratic system in a crisis. This is more concerning. At the time of forming this coalition, they said that they joined hands due to the special circumstances of the country. But they didn’t work as per the special needs.You wrote a book entitled Preventing Election Violence Through Diplomacy in 2020 after a comprehensive research on some African countries. Do you see any similarities between politics of Africa and Nepal?In the course of that research, I studied some elected as well as non-elected dictators in Africa and Latin America. The dictators always think along the lines of ‘me and mine’. Instead of strengthening state agencies, they want to turn the agencies in their favour. Over time, some dictators realise they are making one mistake after another and they reach a point where they want to quit. But the coterie that surrounds the leader doesn’t allow him or her to quit. Those who are benefitting from the rule even threaten to kill the dictator if he/she plans to call it quits. Then, the dictators want some external intervention, beyond the tight circle. I found such circumstances in my case studies. It is so unfortunate that I see something similar happening in Nepal. The way a group of people encircle our top leaders and defend even their wrongdoings, it gives me a feeling of deja vu. In our case, some leaders are advised not to quit as a true successor has not been groomed.  \nDuring his term as home minister in the previous Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government that was toppled in mid-July, Narayan Kaji Shrestha, who is also senior vice-chair of the CPN (Maoist Centre), undertook some bold actions. He swung into action on high profile corruption cases such as Bhutanese refugee scam, Lalita Niwas land grab and cross-border gold smuggling. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal met him on Sunday to ask him of the performance of the new government, the saga around the arrest of Rastriya Swatantra Party chair Rabi Lamichhane.CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, as leader of the main opposition party, convened a joint meeting of opposition parties on Friday. It seems the opposition parties want to solidify their unity against the ruling coalition. What will be the opposition camp’s strategy to build pressure on the government?The government has not been effective in relief distribution, rehabilitation and reconstruction in the areas ravaged by the devastating floods and landslides in the last week of September. Therefore, we convened the meeting to draw the government’s attention to this sorry state of affairs. Second, right since the formation of this government [in mid-July], we suspected this coalition would play a negative role in terms of controlling corruption as the present coalition partners joined hands after being scared of the anti-corruption movement launched by our government [led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal]. It has become imperative to stop the government from doing wrong things and alert the people. Third, there are suspicions that the government is preparing to make it easier for dissident groups in various parties to split political parties by amending the Political Parties Act-2017 through an ordinance. Thus, we basically wanted to press the government to effectively carry out the post-disaster rehabilitation works and stop it from various wrongdoings.Are there specific issues on which the opposition camp wants to build pressure?Effective work on rehabilitation and reconstruction in the disaster-hit areas is our immediate demand. In the long-run, we want to raise the agenda of good governance because developing Nepal as a prosperous country and ensuring social justice should be our central mission. But this isn’t possible without first curbing rampant corruption. Unfortunately, the government is taking a negative approach in this connection.Could you give more specific details where the government went wrong in terms of corruption?To take the latest example, the CPN-UML, which is headed by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, recently accepted a donation of land worth tens of millions of rupees from Min Bahadur Gurung, owner of the country’s largest retail chain, Bhatbhateni Supermarket. The business tycoon has also announced plans to make a building for the party. During our tenure, the government filed a corruption case against him in Lalita Niwas land scam. He was arrested and later the Special Court convicted him of corruption. The land has already been retained as government property. Later, he moved the Supreme Court, where the case is sub judice. Prime Minister Oli had earlier vented his ire for arresting and filing a case against Gurung. We had suspected that he had done something wrong in collusion with Gurung. Oli’s acceptance of the property in the name of donation is unacceptable on political and moral grounds. It is against the good governance drive we launched. You know, we had initiated action in various major corruption scams during our tenure. There are reports that the government is trying to give clean chit to the accused instead of taking the process ahead. Thus the present coalition is working against good governance.In the meeting of the opposition coalition on Friday, Rastriya Swatantra Party chair Rabi Lamichhane, who was arrested on Saturday, sought support of other opposition parties [based on the information that he was being arrested] arguing that action against him was politically motivated. Will the opposition parties support him?Any case should be independently and fairly investigated. No culprit should be spared. At the same time, no political bias should reflect in the investigation. We can’t say anything about the government agencies’ investigation process. The meeting stressed on the same. It was during my tenure as home minister that the government initiated the investigation against Lamichhane after a supplementary case was registered at the Kaski District Police Office, accusing him of misusing deposits from a Kaski-based cooperative. Later, the parliament formed a special probe committee to investigate. Now the home ministry has taken action against him based on the recommendation of the same panel. We have to cooperate with the government in its investigation. The only thing we can say is that the investigation should be fair and independent. No political party can stand against the investigation itself. How do you see the protests by the RSP cadres following his arrest?They can raise their voice against the possibility of political revenge in the case and demand fair investigation. But they have to cooperate in the investigation and accept the findings. No one can obstruct the investigation just because someone is a politician. The government agencies can’t enforce rule of law if all political parties start protesting against investigations on individuals affiliated to them. A few of the RSP’s concerns are valid too. They argue that the government is working in a discriminatory way. For instance, there are reports with evidence showing involvement of some Nepali Congress and CPN-UML leaders in various cooperatives’ scams. They have asked why the government is not taking any action against them. This is a valid question. The authorities should take action against Congress and UML leaders as well to prove that the government is not discriminatory.Various high-profile corruption cases were prosecuted during your tenure as home minister. You understand if a case has been built on strong or weak grounds. From that perspective, what is your observation of Lamichhane’s case?Rabi ji himself has accepted a level of involvement in the case and said that he is ready to bear the financial liability of the cooperative money invested in the Gorkha Media Network [where he was managing director]. I can comment about the overall case only after the investigation is completed.The fact that over half-a-dozen home ministers since 1990 have been prosecuted in corruption cases shows powerful politicians are involved in corruption. Can this deep-rooted corruption be cleaned up?It is one of the major reasons hindering Nepal’s development. Corruption is promoted by those who are in key state positions. Therefore, we often say our state agencies are influenced by comprador capitalists and there is no investment in productive sectors that would create jobs. Our entire economic ecosystem of creating demand, production, supply and employment has failed. The nexus between powerful politicians, bureaucrats and a handful of business tycoons is promoting activities from where they get huge commissions, and where they get to exploit state coffers. Nepal can’t progress without breaking this nexus. We had taken strong actions in that direction. Unfortunately, the present coalition stopped that process and the comprador capitalists have yet again become active.You must have faced pressure from the political and other quarters when you took action against powerful leaders. Could you give some examples of such pressure?You know, though our party led the government, the other party [Nepali Congress] was the bigger force in the coalition government and actions were taken against the major leaders of the coalition partners. Even those who were affiliated to our party faced actions. So, definitely I faced immense political pressure. But no one could stop me as I was determined to complete my mission of good governance. But a section of people accuse you of sparing individuals close to top leaders and that some individuals were later freed on bail as the cases against them weren’t built as strongly.That is not the case. I pushed the cases despite huge political pressures. But the court later freed them on bail, where we have no role. The court has put some individuals behind bars while some were released. The role of the court is certainly a matter of research. You are right that people wonder why more powerful people aren’t brought under investigation even in big scams such as Bhutanese refugee scam and Lalita Niwas land grab. Media reports indicating powerful individuals’ involvement might be true. However, the government agencies can’t take action against anyone without sufficient evidence. Many have asked why two former prime ministers—Madhav Kumar Nepal and Baburam Bhattarai—were not prosecuted. The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) didn’t recommend action against them saying that the policy decisions made in Cabinet meetings don’t fall under its jurisdiction. And, it is still unclear which decisions made in the Cabinet are policy decisions and which aren’t.The secretaries who prepare proposals for Cabinet decisions are held responsible while the ministers who present the same proposals for a decision at the Cabinet meeting and the chief of the Cabinet are not held responsible. People have raised questions about this practice. I think this is a valid question and should be addressed properly. I also believe the ministers who present a proposal for a decision should be held responsible.Also questions were raised over the way the statements of the two prime ministers [Nepal and Bhattarai] were recorded at their homes and in the absence of a government attorney.I take this criticism positively. When I enquired about this episode, police told me that they did so because the CIAA had earlier recorded other former prime ministers at their homes and the police followed the same precedent. In the future, we should be careful. There is one crucial aspect in this case. The two prime ministers weren’t prosecuted in the Lalita Niwas land grab case. But the court has proved that the land deal was wrong. So, it has been recovered as government property. Thus, the decisions taken from the Cabinet meetings [chaired by Nepal and Bhattarai] were wrong. Don’t they need to do public self-criticism?Let’s move on to party politics. As in the past, leaders in your party rigorously discussed the issue of leadership change in Maoist Centre in recent meetings. But nothing happened. Do you see any chance of leadership change in the Maoist Centre?In our recent party meetings, we discussed whether the party’s transformation is more important or leadership change. We need a more unified, transformed and stronger party to implement our party’s agenda in national politics. This is more important. We discussed whether our leadership at present is obstructing this process. Our leadership is ready to work to transform the party, make the organisation stronger and then hand over the leadership. Our chair wants to take the party back to its past strength. We have taken his spirit positively. But this doesn’t mean that Prachanda [Dahal] is irreplaceable.Amid reports about reunification between various Maoist parties, party chairman Dahal and Nepal Communist Party General Secretary Netra Bikram Chand have both spoken on the need for such reunification. Is it happening soon?Our conclusion is that our party can take leadership in carrying out important national tasks. In principle we are in the right direction but the party can’t accomplish the tasks in its present form. So it needs to be made stronger. The ideological and moral grounds of our party have eroded. We have been distanced from downtrodden communities while party leaders have increased proximity with the well-off class. On the other hand, corruption has increased within the party. Therefore, we want to transform the party into a more revolutionary and stronger force. This should be the priority. But even after that, our party’s present strength alone will not suffice to accomplish important national tasks. So we have decided to join hands with more left and Maoist forces. Discussions with various groups for party unity and forging alliances are underway.Reports say the negotiation with the Chand-led party is more positive.The [Chand-led] party made two important decisions from a central committee meeting. They decided to go for party unity and take part in the next general elections. This is an important policy departure of the party. It has increased the possibility of party unity. But we haven’t reached any definite conclusion in this connection. Do you see any chances of forging a working alliance with new forces such as the RSP?The new forces raised an agenda [of good governance] and got good support from the public in elections. But people have already started complaining against them saying that they didn’t work as per their promises. They have started comparing them to traditional forces. The new leaders from whom people had expected a lot have already courted controversy. Having said that, we can’t brush aside the public disenchantment towards major political forces as well.The RSP champions an agenda which is quite different from what the Maoist Centre lobbies for. For instance, the policies the Maoist Centre and the RSP advocate on the federal system are opposite. In this context, can the two parties be long-term allies?The RSP has failed to be honest to the agenda it championed in the elections and to make its political ideology clear. And it has adopted a wrong policy on the federal system. Therefore, at present, we can’t say that we will have a long-term strategic collaboration. There is no reliable basis for that. As far as a working alliance is concerned, it can be with any party. For instance, we have diametrically opposed political viewpoints with the Rastriya Prajatantra Party. They want monarchy while we are strongly for the republic system. They are against federalism while we want a stronger federal system. But we can still forge a working alliance with them on certain agendas.Opposition parties seem quite scared of ordinance on Political Parties Act-2017. There is a need to end the legal void that exists after Congress-Maoist Centre government issued an ordinance three years ago. Is it based on the information about certain provisions that the government is implementing or because it is being brought by bypassing the parliament?It is true that there has been delay in reviving the provisions of the law that were inactivated after introduction of the ordinance at the time. We want that to be done through parliament. Now the government wants to make changes in it because it wants to meet certain vested political interests through it. There are suspicions that the present government leadership is working to split small parties and make the UML the largest in the House of Representatives.Why would Congress help the prime minister bring an ordinance that would make it smaller than the UML?That is why they might be at loggerheads over the issue. What I heard is that both the proposals to arrest Rabi Lamichhane and to issue the ordinance on the Political Parties Act-2017 were discussed in the same Cabinet meeting. The Congress reportedly pushed for the proposal on Lamichhane while the prime minister was for issuing the ordinance as well. It is certain that there is a tug of war between the two sides over the ordinance. \nCentral and eastern parts of Nepal witnessed devastating incidents of landslides and floods last week. At least 244 people were killed, while 19 are still missing. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Basanta Raj Adhikari, director at the Centre for Disaster Studies, Institute of Engineering at Tribhuvan University, to discuss how the country can be better prepared to manage the disasters and minimise damages.Recently we faced disastrous floods and landslides. How do you analyse the losses? Could the damages have been reduced with better preparation and timely response?To begin with, I want to make one thing clear. There is a fundamental difference between a disaster and hazard. Hazard is always natural but it becomes a disaster if there is human involvement. If there is a landslide in a jungle with no human activity, it is a hazard. If a landslide hit a human settlement and it required external involvement to restore the place, then it becomes a disaster. An earthquake is a hazard but it becomes a disaster when man-made structures kill people. As far as the losses from the recent floods are concerned, we could have minimised them with better preparation. For instance, Nakkhu was one of the worst hit areas in the Kathmandu Valley. The river there has drastically narrowed and a human settlement has been developed on the riverbanks in recent years. Human activities in rivers are natural as human civilisations took place on the banks of rivers. But it should be done without disrupting the natural flow of the water. We developed huge settlements encroaching the riverbanks. This invited huge losses. Such activities could have been avoided.As Nepal witnessed record-high rainfalls, were not these losses to be expected? It is true that the country witnessed record rainfalls this season, the highest in the past over five decades. Climate change has caused extreme weather events in recent years. But we can’t blame only natural factors. If you see the images of 2003, it clearly shows that the place where the MediCity Hospital now stands is clearly the floodplain of the Nakkhu river. If you go further downstream, you see a colony. This is how we have encroached riverbanks. We can encroach rivers but it should be done in a scientific way. What is scientific encroachment of rivers?We can model flooding based on the highest volume of water a river can carry. Based on such evidence, we can decide what kind of activities can and cannot be carried out on a riverbank. We can develop settlements but that should be based on scientific evidence and data. Another important concept we should follow is risk sensitive land use planning. Nepal government has already prepared land use maps of all the 753 local units that give vital information about a particular place such as the soil, land capability, risk layer, present land use map, zoning map and cadastral layer. But some people have stopped the authorities from implementing the maps as once they are passed, a land categorised as an agricultural area cannot be converted into commercial land. If that scheme is implemented, one can’t build a house in high flood land. Now the local authorities enforce only the building codes and that don’t include these provisions. That doesn’t inquire whether a building is being built on a riverbank or a landslide susceptible area. In developed countries, those who build in high flood risk areas have to pay more in insurance. Also, areas are categorised based on the chances of occurrence of landslides on the basis of soil type, rock type, geology, distance from a drainage or a road etcetera and structures built there are dealt with accordingly. We are witnessing extreme weather events. In this context, what should we do to prevent more loss in the days ahead?We require an engineering paradigm shift in building infrastructures. The extreme weather patterns have made the data we used to refer to in the past while building infrastructures irrelevant. The data on water levels that were referred to while making a bridge in a river now need to be updated as water levels in our rivers have been rising in recent years. The existing infrastructures can’t withstand that volume of water. We witnessed record rainfalls last week. This can be a reference data for some years. Also, the sedimentation pattern has changed because of human settlements built upstream.Second, we have a generalised rule of building roads across the country. The impact of 200 millilitres of rainfall in Pokhara and rainfall of the same volume in Jhapa is different. As Pokhara experiences rains on a regular basis, the soil in the area can withstand it because it has been weathered by regular rain but the same volume of rainfall can cause more losses in Jhapa because of weak soil there. We thus have to consider the strength of soil while building a structure in a particular place.There is a single road construction method across the country, whether the place is in a high himalayan range, Mahabharat, Shivalik hills or plains. We have to make specific rules for specific places based on the geological and soil structures. The parameters of road construction should be redefined. We are improving the weather forecasting system but now we also need impact-based forecasting to inform the public not only about the volume of likely rainfall but also its likely impact.Where are the problems in our disaster response approach?The Natural Calamity (Relief) Act, 1982 was guided by a fatalistic approach as it saw natural hazards as destined by fate. Then came Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act, 2017. This change in law is in fact a paradigm shift in disaster management in Nepal. The new law’s perspective is progressive. The new Act changed us from response-centric to preparedness-centric. Legally, we are on a progressive path. But we lag in implementation. We also need to upgrade our skills in handling the situation. Our constitution as well as laws have entrusted local units with the responsibility of handling disaster incidents on their own. The government should make people at the local level aware, and equip and train them for the purpose.Training on some important procedures such as the INSARAG preparedness and response guidelines can be quite effective. Such training and other activities aimed at helping local units to handle disaster incidents should be conducted at the ward levels. “Understanding risk” is an important aspect in disaster management. So common people should be sensitised to the consequences of disaster incidents. You can see people collecting timber from flooded rivers, taking selfies on riverbanks and gathering on a bridge above a roaring river. People at all local wards need to be well-equipped. Those who were swept away at Nakkhu could have been saved if the security personnel and other people there had at least motorboats and life jackets. Our rescue workers now lack even such basic things.Settlements in Nepal’s mountainous and hill areas are located in equally risky zones. What should be done to safeguard them?The mountains in our region are taken as young and the Himalayan range is in the building process. It is also called an active mountain belt. Therefore, we experience frequent earthquakes. Earthquakes cause geomorphological changes. A large number of settlements in Nepal’s hills sit on the debris of old landslides that might have occurred long back. People there should be made aware of the risk and these places be identified. Engineering measures should be taken to make them safe. Scattered populations mainly in the highlands need to be integrated in concentrated settlements.What is the latest status of glaciers and glacial lakes in our mountains?The pace of glacial melting is rising alarmingly because of rising temperature. Earlier, we took only big glacial lakes as threats and gave them more attention but recent incidents showed that even smaller ones pose a threat. The incident of the Thame glacial lake outburst in August showed how the outburst of even a small glacial lake could have a cascading effect. Likewise, the deposits of landslides being piled above 3,000 metres are another serious challenge. Such sediment deposition is increasing in the mountains while there is a huge population downstream. The frequency of cascading hazards has increased, emerging as a major challenge. A landslide blocks a river and when the river breaches the structure built of debris, it causes devastating losses downstream.How can we scientifically prove that the hazards we are seeing were the result of climate change?There has to be scientific evidence to make the link. For instance, the Thame glacial outburst was clearly a climate change-induced hazard as it did not involve human activities. The treeline and snowline are shifting upwards in our mountains. There were no mosquitoes in Mustang until some years ago. Now mosquitos are widespread in the district as temperature there has significantly increased. The crop pattern has changed drastically. Thus we have a number of scientific evidence to show clear signs of climate change in this part of the world. What the government should now do is properly document these climate change-induced incidents following internationally-accepted methods and present them at relevant UN bodies. \nNepal’s economy that has been facing one after another setbacks since the 2015 earthquake has been struggling to bounce back. Last week, two international agencies—the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB)—announced that Nepal’s economy was poised to improve in the upcoming fiscal year. In this context, the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Nara Bahadur Thapa, former executive director of the research department of Nepal Rastra Bank, to discuss the current state of the national economy. The ADB, in its report last week, anticipated Nepal’s economy to grow by 4.9 percent this fiscal. A few days earlier, a visiting IMF team also painted an improving picture of Nepal’s economy. How do you see these projections?Nepal’s economic growth in the past 2-3 years has remained below 5 percent. But successive governments in their fiscal budgets have been setting the target of 6 to 7 percent growth. Also, the budget this year has aimed for 6 percent growth. In the meantime, two donor agencies have painted an improving picture of our economy. The ADB has anticipated 4.9 percent growth. Also, the IMF’s team that visited Nepal on a fact finding mission has projected better prospects. They expected better yield from the agriculture sector as Nepal is witnessing more rains. Last year, the growth of agriculture was 3 percent. Now they expect the sector may grow by 3.5 to 4 percent and that may lift overall growth. They have cited improvement in tourism and increased energy export as other bases. Based on these grounds, the ADB has projected 4.9 percent economic growth. But even the target of 5 percent growth looks ambitious if you analyse economic data available as of now and the steps taken by government agencies. We have witnessed more rain but that doesn’t always do us good. More rain in the late monsoon often damages paddy at the time of harvest. Second, the heavy monsoon has caused huge losses in our infrastructure such as roads and bridges that are vital to keep the daily lives and trade running. This may impact potential economic growth as some vital highways and roads have been badly damaged. These factors may pose a challenge in achieving the targets set by the government and donor agencies. Another important factor is that the ratio of capital formation to GDP [gross domestic product] is consistently decreasing. It was 33.8 in the fiscal year 2018-19, it decreased to 30.5 in 2019-20, to 29.3 in 2020-21, 29.0 in 2021-22, 25.1 in 2022-23 and 24.5 in 2023-24. How can we expect economic growth when capital formation keeps decreasing. We can’t achieve 6 percent growth without first improving the situation of capital formation. Capital formation in the private sector is on a decline and the government hasn’t been able to boost it. On the other hand, capital expenditure was lower in the past fiscal year in comparison to the previous fiscal. There is no strong sign of increasing capital formation even in the coming year. This is because the government has failed to collect revenue as per its own target. The revenue collection ratio is falling. It has come down to 18 percent of GDP, from 22 percent not so long ago. With this, the government’s funding capacity is continuously declining. It has failed even to fulfil its own duties. For instance, it hasn’t been able to pay health insurance bills and or the contractors. Similarly, credit offtake from private banks to the private sector has not increased from 6 percent. It used to be around 15-16 percent. Also, no substantive initiatives have been taken to improve productivity. For this, government agencies have to cut red tape. The private sector isn’t optimistic. We are talking a lot but not working seriously to lay a strong ground for growth.What are the signs that private investors are pessimistic?There is enough liquidity in the banks, and the interest rate is decreasing, but the private sector is not borrowing. Bankers say there is no demand from the sector. This indicates pessimism. None of the big business houses have launched any big projects in recent times. The government talks a lot about the energy sector but it is not doing power purchase agreements (PPAs) with hydropower project developers. We aren’t doing enough to realise the goal of exporting 10,000MW electricity to India. This shows no serious effort is being made to initiate reforms. The capital market has required some urgent reforms. But the government hasn’t appointed office bearers in the regulatory body for the past seven months. The government hasn’t given permission to issue IPOs and FPOs. Hence, the government is keeping two important sectors—energy and capital market—on hold. All these trends and activities suggest it will be a challenge to achieve even moderate economic growth.You pointed to the policy hurdles but the multilateral agencies have hailed the government for policy reforms. The IMF in its statement has welcomed recent amendments to various laws and the ADB has welcomed “the cautiously accommodative monetary policy”. Don’t these statements reflect reality?While making their positions public, the international agencies follow certain norms and criteria. First, they take macro pictures such as the government’s commitments. They take the pledges made by the government in the investment summit seriously. They think the commitments will be implemented. Second, they don’t want to irk the host country by presenting a bleak picture because they are diplomats. They point out possible pitfalls during bilateral and table talks but present themselves diplomatically while making their official statements public.Remittance, tourism and energy export are taken as major bases for economic growth but all three depend on external factors. How reliable can the projection be?Without trading and increasing exports, we can’t progress economically. We need to export to increase production and create jobs. Export is an engine of economic growth. Anyhow, we must increase exports. About your query, the government should tackle such things by strengthening relations with the countries concerned and devise policies and strategies accordingly.Our economy is increasingly dependent on remittance. How risky is it in the long run?Remittance has become a boon for our economy. It has played a tremendous role in poverty reduction. The first Nepal Living Standard Survey (NLSS) conducted by the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS)—now the National Statistics Office—in 1995-96 showed 42 percent Nepali population living below the poverty line. The latest [fourth] living standard survey has shown the poverty level at 20 percent. It wouldn’t be possible without remittance. Therefore, we can’t undermine the role of remittance in this social transformation. Were not the government’s plans and policies responsible for this achievement?The government role would not have been enough. What government policies have created jobs in Nepal? Are there any schemes worth mentioning? The industrialisation hasn’t increased. It is the industrial sector that creates jobs but the share of the manufacturing sector has come down to 4.87 percent in total GDP. Some years ago, it was nearly 9-10 percent. It shows our economy is being deindustrialised. How can we reduce poverty without providing jobs to the youths? Thus, foreign employment played a vital role in poverty reduction. Second is the role of remittance in maintaining foreign exchange reserves, which is essential to buy things from abroad. We have sufficient foreign exchange reserves because of remittance.Information Technology is now projected as a promising sector in creating jobs and transforming Nepal’s economy. How realistic is this expectation?Four fields can be taken as promising sectors in Nepal—agriculture, tourism, IT and hydropower. The IT sector certainly has a bright future. As our country is land-locked, we have additional challenges in merchandise exports and we can’t be competitive. The IT sector won’t have that barrier so it can be competitive in the international market. But for that the government has to formulate IT-friendly policies. For instance, if a Kathmandu-based Nepali firm wants to sell services in the US, Europe or any other international market, they need liaison offices in those countries. Otherwise, they can’t be competitive and grow. But the government doesn’t provide foreign exchange for them to expand their business abroad.Without this policy reform, Nepalis can’t compete with IT companies from other countries. Similarly, foreign companies need to come and work here so that Nepali youths can learn from them. Foreign banks came to Nepal and Nepali bankers learned. Now Nepali banks are doing good. But our policies aren’t favourable for foreigners interested in setting up IT firms. Also, well-trained IT workers are in shortage. We are progressing but we have to put in extra effort to make transformative changes in this sector.The cooperatives’ scam has emerged as a serious issue. What impact may it cause in the national economy if it’s not resolved soon?The cooperative sector played a vital role in creating financial inclusion in our economy by making 7.3 million people its members. Those who couldn’t do their regular transactions with banks were engaged with cooperatives. If that sector collapses, our state of financial inclusion will decline too. Second, they were major financiers for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME). Cooperatives are directly linked to entrepreneurship through MSMEs. They played a role in making interest rates of banks more competitive as well as banks and financial institutions were under pressure by the interest rates offered by cooperatives. Now they won’t feel the pressure.In this context, many people may resort to informal transactions. According to the 16th periodic plan, nearly 50 percent of Nepal’s economy is informal. We are under pressure to reduce the portion of the informal economy. But the crisis in the cooperative sector may increase the informal economy as those who were involved in cooperatives, which is a formal sector, are likely to do informal transactions with traders or other individuals.Cooperatives are not well regulated and there are anomalies but they are registered in a government agency, pay taxes, have offices and a record system. They brought people in far-flung villages under a formal channel. If the depositors resort to individual transactions, their money will be unsafe. The constitution accepted them as one of the three pillars—along with the government and the private sector—of the country’s economy. The sector expanded its network where there were no economic activities from the government and private sectors. For instance, the government was providing certain services such as distributing fertilisers, crop seeds, sugar through cooperatives. People will now be deprived of these services. Also, the commercial banks might face complications due to the domino effect of the cooperative scam. For instance, if the government seizes the land put up by a cooperative as a collateral in a bank and sells it to return the deposits, the bank might be in trouble.It is also said that cooperatives were becoming platforms for money laundering. How serious was the problem?Cooperatives didn’t seek a source of money from the depositors while accepting big deposits. They weren’t affiliated to the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of the central bank and the Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT). Therefore, there is a problem of money laundering. It can be resolved when they get affiliated with the FIU.What initiatives should be taken to address the problems seen in the cooperative sector?A powerful regulatory authority should be established without delay. The authority should work as a dedicated agency to clear the mess. Then, AML/CFT provisions should be implemented, a credit information centre should be set up and a debt recovery tribunal formed, and deposits guaranteed. The concept of self-regulation isn’t enough. These financial infrastructures are essential. \nOn Friday the weather is forecast to be partly cloudy in the hilly areas of Koshi, Bagmati, Gandaki and Karnali Province and partly cloudy to mainly fair in the rest of the country.Tonight the weather in the hilly areas of Koshi, Bagmati, Gandaki and Karnali Province is forecast to be partly cloudy while the rest of the country will remain mainly fair.The Meteorological Forecasting Division said the weather is influenced by westerly winds across the country, along with local winds affecting the hilly areas.On Thursday, Janakpur recorded the highest temperature at 31.5°C, while Jumla saw the lowest at -1°C.

Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli said that his upcoming China visit will not hurt Nepal’s ties with India.Speaking at the concluding session of the Kantipur Conclave in Kathmandu on Thursday, the prime minister, who is set to visit China in the first week of December, stated there is no reason for his visit to harm relations with India just because he is going to China first than India. “We are a sovereign nation and we have never said that we won’t visit India,” the prime minister said, adding, “We choose to go where it is convenient.” Traditionally, Nepali prime ministers have made India their first port of call after assuming office. However, after failing to receive an invitation from India for several weeks, the prime minister went to New York to attend the 79th session of the UN General Assembly where he met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi, and several other world leaders.“I went to the US to attend the UN General Assembly because the UN is [headquartered] in the US, where I met several world leaders, but it does not mean that I wanted to visit the US first,” said Oli, adding, “We are surrounded by two great neighbours and we have to maintain good relations with them.”“And my visit to China will not damage our relations with India. Our relations with India are deep, historical, based on culture and tradition, and predate the formation of modern states. We are sovereign nations and make foreign trips as per our convenience,” said Oli.Oli was speaking at the Kantipur Conclave’s concluding session moderated by Kantipur Editor-in-Chief Umesh Chauhan on Thursday.During the interaction, Oli discussed a range of domestic issues including the country's economy, national politics, issue of constitution amendment, relations between the federal and provincial governments, and the arrest of Rastriya Swatantra Party chairman and former deputy prime minister Rabi Lamichhane, among other things. Responding to the ongoing street protests by Rastriya Swatantra Party supporters opposing the arrest of their party chief, and the calls by some groups calling for the restoration of monarchy and dissolution of the current constitution, the prime minister said he is ready for any kind of open discussion on these issues. He said he welcomes dialogues on the future of the political system, but won’t allow the constituion to be torn down.Oli also defended the progress made over the last three decades (since the restoration of democracy in 1990), highlighting significant strides in infrastructure. “Road networks have now reached 98 percent of the country.” On the arrest of Lamichhane, who is in police custody on charges of cooperatives fraud, the prime minister stated that he cannot protect Lamichhane if he had committed wrongdoings.\"The court will look into his case…if someone makes mistakes and blames others, it is unacceptable,\" said Oli. Oli also gave some background on how he had helped Lamichhane and hired him as a television anchor when he was jobless. “I gave him the job, and he later joined politics,” said Oli, adding that he would not tolerate corruption.I favoured him, but I never thought that Rabi was involved in cooperative scam,” said Oli, and claimed that he was initially against forming the parliamentary probe, but Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Lamichhane himself requested such a probe. Rastriya Swatantra Party’s protests and demonstrations “aimed at pressuring the court” are unacceptable, Oli said, adding, “Let the law take its course.”The prime minister also dismissed the allegations that the government was working on a new law on political parties to facilitate party splits. “There is a void so we have to bring a new law,” he said, adding “The UML does not need to be the largest party to claim the premiership.” It is believed that the government wants to make party splits easier, because the UML wants to merge dissident groups in a few parties including the CPN (Unified Socialist) and the Janata Samajbadi Party into its fold.Speaking at the conclave, the prime minister said the government will bring laws to support provincial governments.“We will review the constitution. We will enact laws. We will provide them [provinces] the required rights.” \nNepal’s multiple requests to India to ease Nepal’s export restrictions by easing the Bureau of Indian Standards certification process have gone unanswered, according to two officials who are aware of the development.Government officials say the restrictions began two years ago with export barriers on cement, and multiple requests have been submitted to India seeking to address the matter.“Since the Bureau of Indian Standard (BIS) certificate issues started hindering Nepali manufacturers and exporters, the Ministry of Industry, through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, has regularly informed its Indian counterpart about the issue and requested changes to the process. But there has been no response,” a top official of the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies told the Post on condition of anonymity.According to the Cement Manufacturers’ Association of Nepal, a dozen Nepali cement factories applied for BIS certification in 2022 to make their products eligible for export, particularly to India. According to the manufacturers the Post spoke to, the certification should be issued two months after the manufacturers' applications are processed. But none of them have been able to get it.Export of Nepali cements has been stalled time and again over BIS-related issues.“The issues started with cement, and since then, Indian authorities have expanded restrictions to include many other goods like Goldstar shoes. They have halted exports of all products. There has been no development on the issues to date,” said the official.The Post’s attempts to get a comment from the Indian Embassy in Nepal were unsuccessful.In 2020, the Indian government asked the BIS to prescribe mandatory standards for imported goods in line with international quality norms. The move aimed to prevent Chinese goods from entering India through neighbouring countries.After banning Chinese apps, the Indian government imposed import restrictions on more than 370 Chinese products.Insiders say India does not want any products from Nepal with Chinese components, including Nepal’s hydroelectricity, which is greatly worrying top Nepali exporters.India is Nepal’s largest export destination. The country exported goods worth Rs103.18 billion in the last fiscal year, which ended in mid-July. Similarly, Nepal’s imports from India are massive, amounting to Rs996.68 billion, out of the country’s total imports of Rs1.59 trillion.Nepal majorly exported zinc sheets, shoes and sandals, textiles, tea, polyester yarn, jute goods (hessian and sacking), and fruit juice.According to Nepali authorities, they have been closely watching the issue in other southeast Asian countries.They say Vietnam is also a victim of India’s new rule curbing Chinese components in exports.According to media reports, in May, Vietnam's trade ministry wrote to New Delhi to expedite BIS certification for 26 companies, stating that the delays are hurting business. Most of these companies are engaged in the trade of shoes or steel.The reports say that manufacturers from other countries, especially Chinese companies, are also facing delays in securing BIS certification. In Nepal, domestic manufacturers of sanitary pads and diapers, footwear, cement, and plywood said that despite completing all the processes to obtain a BIS certificate to export their products months ago, they have not been able to get it.Nepal has raised the issue many times with India and even the domestic private sector communicated directly with the BIS, but the Indian side has not responded.The producers said despite completing lab tests and paying fees for BIS certification, no team from India has visited to inspect their factories.According to The Indian Express, India’s Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal stated on October 16 that quality control orders (QCOs) restricting the import and sale of substandard items in the country have been extended to 732 products to align with international standards and boost exports.“QCOs are a key mechanism through which India is not only raising quality standards to enter the global value chain but also restricting imports from China,” according to the media reports. “Imports from China have already crossed $60 billion during the first seven months of 2024, which is 10 percent higher than the $55 billion recorded during the same period last year.”Goyal stated that, until 2014, only 14 QCOs were covering 106 products. However, in the past 10 years, the government has issued 174 such orders, now covering 732 products.Insiders from Nepal’s private sector trade body said India stopped Bangladeshi goods, citing the BIS certification requirement. When Bangladesh threatened a reciprocal action, India promptly issued the BIS certificate.“We even wrote to the Indian authority multiple times, but our requests have fallen on deaf ears,” Dol Raj Adhikari, president of the Nepal Sanitary and Diaper Association, told the Post in a recent interview.As per the provision, once the Indian inspection team gives a green signal after factory inspection, goods can be exported to India.The BIS deals with the marking and certifying goods, incorporating quality standards and information on international norms to be followed while importing.According to the Nepal Sanitary and Diaper Association, Rs250 million worth of sanitary pads and diapers has been stranded in the warehouses for the past three months.Likewise, a big consignment of Goldstar shoes failed to get export clearance after India refused to issue the BIS certificate, putting Nepal’s homegrown shoemaker on the brink.Exports from the cement makers in Rupandehi—such as Arghakhanchi Cement, Sarbottam Cement, Palpa Cement, and Balaji Cement—have completely stopped for nearly two months. Cement plants in Rupandehi are on the verge of shutting down or running under-capacity.India even stopped importing plywood from Nepal due to the BIS issue, but later, it provided certification-free exports until March 2025.Plywood manufacturers said that India is not renewing their quality certificate or providing a BIS certificate even after completing the process in June.Goods under the BIS with compulsory certification are any variety of cement manufactured or sold in India, steel and iron products, chemicals, fertiliser, polymers and textiles, cables, flat transparent sheet glass, cattle feed, footwear, centrifugally cast (spun) iron pipes, jute bags, viscose staple fibres, geotextiles, portable water bottles, plywood, and wooden flush door shutters, among others.The private sector said that the BIS certificate issue has put the industries in Rupandehi in a big dilemma. They were opened to export goods to India. \nOn Wednesday, Nepal national U-19 women’s cricket team followed the path of U-19 men’s cricket team and senior men’s team to reach their maiden T20 World Cup. It will be the first occasion any women’s cricket team from Nepal will appear at the global event when the ICC U-19 Women’s T20 World Cup kicks off in January next year.Last month, Nepal national women’s football team reached their 12th final of a major competition—second of the year and sixth in the SAFF Women’s Championship—but could not win their first international trophy.In August, Nepal national women’s volleyball team’s bid to win an international trophy at home remained unfulfilled when they lost the final of the CAVA Women’s Volleyball Nations League.The same month, Para-taekwondo athlete Palesha Goverdhan created history when she won a bronze medal at the 2024 Paris Paralympic Games , becoming the first ever athlete from Nepal to win a Paralympic medal. Last year, Arika Gurung won Nepal’s only third ever silver medal at the Hangzhou Asian Games in China.Nepali women athletes have shown immense potential that they can go very far in the international competitions, yet they consistently face a lack of essential investment, infrastructure, resources, and support.“There were high hopes that the women’s team would reach the World Cup before the men’s team,” national women’s cricket team captain Indu Barma said while speaking during a session titled ‘Women’s Champions From The Field’ at the Kantipur Conclave on Thursday. “However, women’s cricket was completely ignored after the Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) was suspended, which was a huge blow to our motivation.”Barma, who guided her team to their first Asia Cup since 2016 earlier in July, stressed the need for more focus in the development of women’s sports.“The cricket governing body has shown commitment to advancing women’s cricket. They have provided us with annual contracts. But this alone is not sufficient,” she added. “Unlike men’s cricket, we lack a proper league like the Nepal Premier League. We have asked CAN to establish a women’s league. It’s their responsibility to create a platform for us to compete, just as it is our responsibility to deliver results.”The Prime Minister Cup Women’s National T20 Cricket Tournament was the only domestic tournament held for women’s cricketers this year.National women’s football captain Anjila Tumbapo Subba expressed similar frustration at the event.“We’ve been labelled as losers. But the concerned authorities need to consider why the national women’s team repeatedly falls short—especially in the final,” Subba said.“They should assess how far other South Asian teams have progressed compared to Nepal,” Subba added, referring to Bangladesh, who defeated Nepal in the final for a second successive tournament and won the SAFF Women’s Championship for a consecutive time.In fact, the story of women’s football in Nepal is more depressing than that of cricket.It was Bangladesh’s second title in their third attempt in the title match at the SAFF competition.On the contrary, Nepal were competing in the SAFF after only two weeks of preparation and without playing any international friendly matches.The perception of the world towards the Nepali women’s football has shifted dramatically since their outstanding journey to the final of the WAFF Women’s Championship in February this year. The love for Nepali women’s football was evident during the SAFF Championship, when over 16,000 supporters packed Dasharath Stadium to cheer for them in the semi-final against India and the final. Outdoor screenings were also crowded and online broadcasts also reached record-breaking viewership.However, All Nepal Football Association (ANFA), the nation’s football governing body, has recently posed the greatest challenges to Nepali football. ANFA has failed to organise the Martyrs Memorial A-Division League—country’s premier league—for more than 500 days now.Though the women’s league was finally held after a two-year hiatus, ANFA has yet to announce the schedule for the second round. There are even concerns that, as happened in the 2022-23 season, ANFA might declare champions without completing the league.“It’s ironic that they’ve set their sights on the 2027 FIFA Women’s World Cup when we don’t even have a proper domestic league,” Subba said. “How can they expect results from us under these conditions? We have world-class players like Sabitra Bhandari and Preeti Rai, but with this level of investment and resources, our World Cup dreams will remain out of reach,” added Subba, who recently signed for Greek A-Division club Nees Atromitou, becoming only the second player from Nepal to play in the European league after Bhandari.Bhandari, Nepal’s all-time highest goal scorer in both men’s and women’s football (53 international goals in 52 appearances), plays for En Avant Guingamp in Premiere Ligue, the highest level women’s league in France.“I’m not saying that the authorities haven’t done anything—they’ve introduced equal pay, and they’ve put effort into developing women’s football and supporting players,” Subba acknowledged. “But more is needed. With greater support and investment, we could absolutely reach the World Cup soon.”The situation for women’s volleyball players in Nepal is even more challenging. National women’s volleyball players receive a monthly salary of just Rs5,000, which became possible with the initiative of the Nepal Volleyball Association. In comparison, women’s cricketers earn between Rs20,000 and Rs50,000 through their central contracts, while women’s footballers receive Rs30,000.“Our salary is very low, but the Nepal Volleyball Association is doing its best for us,” said Salina Shrestha, a national women’s volleyball player. “I hope the government will take our concerns seriously and offer us more financial support.”“Another major issue we face is the lack of a dedicated covered hall for training,” Shrestha added. “We have to wait for our turn to practice at the National Sports Council’s covered hall. We’ve already asked the government to build us a separate one, and they’ve promised to provide it soon.”Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli expressed a rather brutal stance regarding the low monthly salaries of women’s volleyball players.“For now, encouragement is all we can offer,” Oli said in response to a question from Kantipur Editor-in-Chief Umesh Chauhan about the government’s plans to improve support for women’s volleyball players during the session In Conversation With The Prime Minister. “There’s nothing more we can do for them.”He acknowledged the need to support athletes, saying, “It’s true we should do something for the players. The government has honoured them with rewards from time to time.”Asian Games silver medallist Gurung said that players must also find motivation within themselves to achieve success. \nIn a landmark development for sub-regional energy cooperation, Nepal has begun exporting electricity to Bangladesh through Indian transmission infrastructure, marking the first instance of Nepal trading power with a third country.The export of 40 megawatts (MW) of electricity follows the historic trilateral agreement signed on October 3 between the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA), Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB), and India’s NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam (NVVN). This agreement facilitates the transmission of Nepal's hydroelectricity to Bangladesh through India's cross-border grid.The energy export was virtually inaugurated by Energy, Water Resources and Irrigation Minister Deepak Khadka of Nepal; Power, Housing and Urban Affairs Minister Manohar Lal of India; and Energy Advisor Muhammad Fouzul Kabir Khan of Bangladesh on Friday. Minister Khadka highlighted the event as a milestone and a reflection of the shared vision for a sustainable and interconnected energy future. “This milestone is a reflection of our shared vision for a sustainable and interconnected energy future in South Asia,” he said.The Indian Ministry of External Affairs mentioned the deal as a significant step in promoting sub-regional energy connectivity.“The start of this power flow from Nepal to Bangladesh through India is expected to boost sub-regional connectivity in the power sector,” read the statement issued by the MEA, India. Nepal will transmit the electricity through the 400KV Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur line in India, which will relay the power to Bangladesh. The export that started Friday afternoon will last only until Friday midnight. The two sides have agreed to trade energy during the period from June 15 to mid-November. The three countries worked to export at least for a day so as to start the implementation of the tripartite agreement from this season. NEA estimates an annual revenue of approximately Rs330 million from the deal. For Nepal, this is the first instance of exporting electricity in dollars.Energy officials have praised the agreement as a milestone for South Asian cooperation. Bangladeshi Minister Syeda Rizwana Hasan stressed the importance of Nepal's hydroelectricity in addressing Bangladesh's renewable energy needs, as hydropower constitutes only 1 percent of its energy mix.This first-of-its-kind deal is expected to bolster regional energy integration and pave the way for further cooperation in South Asia. \nRastriya Swatantra Party chair and former home minister Rabi Lamichhane was brought back to Pokhara on Friday as part of the ongoing investigation into the Supreme Cooperative fraud case.Lamichhane, who is in Kaski police custody, had been transferred to Rupandehi on November 12 to record his statement. He was flown back to Pokhara, according to Kaski Police spokesperson Basant Kumar Sharma. Police in Kaski and Rupandehi districts have been investigating multiple fraud charges filed against RSP chief Lamichhane.The investigation centres around allegations of large-scale embezzlement from the Kaski-based Supreme Cooperative, involving Rs780 million of members’ deposits. Lamichhane is accused of misappropriating Rs19.6 million in personal loans from the cooperative, which were allegedly diverted to Gorkha Media Network Pvt Ltd, a company he co-founded.Lamichhane was taken to Bhairahawa on Tuesday for questioning, where police worked to expedite the recording of his statement. The case involves multiple individuals, including Supreme Cooperative’s manager Sagar KC and former chairman GB Rai, with over 25 suspects still at large.Lamichhane’s political career, which began in 2022 after leaving his role as managing director of Galaxy 4K Television, now faces significant challenges as the investigation unfolds.Police stepped up the investigation as per the recommendations by the Parliamentary special probe panel formed to investigate the issues of crisis-ridden cooperatives including the charges of cooperatives frauds against Lamichhane. \nThe deadline to apply for office bearers at the two transitional justice commissions has been extended by five days even as more than six dozen individuals have already registered their interest to serve at the panels tasked with looking into conflict-era cases of rights violations and disappearances.As many 76 legal experts and rights defenders, including the victims of the decade-long Maoist insurgency, applied for the positions of chairpersons and members of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons as the first deadline ended on Thursday evening. However, following demand from stakeholders, the committee to nominate 10 office bearers decided to extend the deadline for applications until Tuesday.Issuing a statement on Thursday, a group of human rights defenders raised questions over the competitiveness and transparency of the nomination process done under an inadequate time to file applications and limited publicity of the call for applications. The victims’ representatives, in a meeting with the selection committee on Thursday, had suggested a deadline extension. The committee led by former chief justice Om Prakash Mishra abided.“We have extended the deadline by five days while also deciding to call for applications through national television, radio and newspaper,” Khamma Khati, a member of the committee, told the Post.According to officials at the Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs, in addition to the conflict victims, retired judges and bureaucrats, lawyers and human rights activists have applied for the vacant positions. \"Former office bearers of the two commissions too are among the applicants,\" an official at the ministry told the Post.This is the first time those victimised either by the state or by the erstwhile Maoist rebels are contesting to lead the commissions formed to investigate the cases of atrocities from the decade-long insurgency.Retired supreme and high court judges, retired secretary-level bureaucrats or one qualified to be a top court justice are eligible for the role of chairperson of either of the commissions, as per the Enforced Disappeared Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act. Those who hold a master's degree, are not members of any political party at the time of application and have contributed to human rights, conflict resolution or law are eligible for appointment as members.The selection committee has set three modalities for application. While individual aspirants can directly apply for any of the positions, different human rights and victims’ organisations can also recommend the names at the organisational level. Such institutions, however, need the consent of the individuals they are recommending. Seventy-one applicants either applied individually or were recommended by some organisations.After collecting the aspirants’ names, the five-member committee will itself collect the names of experts if the names received through personal applications and organisational recommendations do not suffice. The provision of organisational recommendation and selection by the committee itself was included as renowned figures might not be willing to apply for positions in the commissions.A shortlist of probable candidates will be made public only after evaluating their resumes and backgrounds. Interested people can send their feedback on the short-listed candidates.As per its working procedure, the committee will collect public feedback, ask the candidates to make presentations and carry out other necessary tasks before selecting them for appointment.The stakeholders, however, claim that presentations and public feedback alone are insufficient. The victims of the 1996-2006 conflict and human rights activists have demanded mandatory public hearings for shortlisted candidates before making the nominations.The two commissions have remained defunct since July 2022, when the government extended their terms without retaining their chairmen and members. The government claimed the bill to amend the transitional justice law would be endorsed by October 2022, and the appointments would be made based on the revised Act.However, the federal parliament took over two years to endorse the bill. The victims and human rights defenders are now closely watching who will be appointed to the commissions.The amended Act sets four-year terms for the two transitional justice commissions to investigate the cases and recommend prosecution and reparation. However, if they fail to accomplish their tasks within the given time, they may be granted a term extension.The truth commission has received 63,718 complaints, while the commission on disappearances is sitting on around 2,400 cases. As the recent amendment to the Act has included a provision to allocate additional three months to collect the applications, the number will further increase.The commissions, first formed in 2015, have done little beyond collecting complaints and conducting preliminary investigations on some cases. The to-be-formed commissions will be the third formed in a decade. \nThe Nepal Oil Corporation (NOC) has increased the prices of diesel and kerosene by Rs3 per litre, effective from midnight Friday.As per the revised rates, consumers in Kathmandu, Pokhara, and Dipayal will have to pay Rs153 per litre for diesel and kerosene. In Surkhet and Dang, the price is set at Rs152, while in Charaali, Biratnagar, Janakpur, Amlekhgunj, Bhalwari, Nepalgunj, Dhangadhi, and Birgunj, it will cost Rs150.50 per litre.The NOC clarified that the adjustment was made following a new tariff received from its sole supplier, Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), which increased the cost by Rs2.54 per litre for diesel.The corporation classifies depots into three categories, with the first including Charaali, Biratnagar, Janakpur, Amlekhgunj, Bhalwari, Nepalgunj, Dhangadhi, and Birgunj; the second, Surkhet and Dang; and the third, Kathmandu, Pokhara, and Dipayal.NOC sets prices under an automatic pricing mechanism, aligning rates with tariffs provided by IOC, which revises export prices fortnightly for diesel and kerosene. \nDiabetes, a chronic disease caused by high glucose levels in the blood, consistently figures as one of the ten leading causes of death globally. The number of people with diabetes has doubled over the past 30 years, with over 800 million people worldwide now living with the condition, according to a new report by The Lancet. Like most non-communicable diseases, the prevalence of diabetes is particularly high in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In Nepal, 8.5 percent of the population is affected by this disease, and alarmingly, the infection rate continues to rise. Worse, poor countries also have younger people suffering from it, but they lack effective treatment, and the disease often goes unnoticed. By all accounts, diabetes has emerged as a growing public health crisis, calling for urgent measures to combat it.While the more developed countries have been able to reduce the number of diabetes patients over the years, the developing ones often fail to ensure even basic treatment facilities, which has prevented early detection and diagnosis of the disease. Even though diabetes is rooted in our poor lifestyle choices—lack of exercise, junk food, stressful work routines, and so on—the absence of easy access to treatment has exacerbated the problem. This has not only increased untreated patients in LMICs but also led to issues like kidney failure, loss of vision, stroke, heart attack, multi-organ failure, lower limb amputations, and, in the worst cases, premature death.Diabetes and its growing threat in low- and middle-income countries should serve as a wake-up call for governments. Investing in public health is the best intervention for the disease. Still, rather than increasing the budget in the health sector, Nepal is setting aside a meagre percentage (4.6 percent) of the total budget, affecting several healthcare programmes. Even though the country increased investment in health by 2.5 percent this year after facing criticisms for cutting it in the previous fiscal year, the amount falls short of providing patients with basic treatment services for early detection and timely intervention of diseases. The health ministry and authorities concerned should rethink their policies without further delay.The need for behavioural change on the part of the general public cannot be ignored either. Educated and young people living in urban areas have resources and tools that allow them to come to terms with the dangers of diabetes, go for regular health check-ups and opt for healthy lifestyles. Moreover, the government and healthcare workers should initiate awareness programmes, especially for the illiterate population. Hospitals in rural settings must be equipped with the necessary tools to diagnose and treat diabetes. Subsidised medications and insulin can alleviate the financial burden on patients. Policies encouraging healthy lifestyles and food could also go a long way in preventing it.Mitigating the disease has global support. The World Health Organisation recently launched the ‘Guidance on global monitoring for diabetes prevention and control’ framework. Nepal and other low- and middle-income countries should tap into such opportunities to bring tangible results regarding diabetes. They should also emulate successful measures that developed countries have taken to curb the rise of the disease. Collaboration between countries can also facilitate the exchange of best practices among countries. Ultimately, the battle against diabetes requires a collective effort. Individuals, patients, policymakers and organisations should all come together and put in concerted efforts in breaking its chain and ushering in a healthier future for all. \nIn the 1980s, most anthropologists who did research on Nepal were non-Nepalis and most historians who researched on Nepal were Nepali citizens. There were, of course, a few honourable exceptions in both camps. By the 1990s, the situation began to change for the set of anthropologists of Nepal. Although new videshi anthropologists enrolled in universities in the United States, United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, France, Australia and a few other countries continued to come to Nepal to research, the number of Nepali anthropologists also began to grow steadily. Many in the latter group were trained at Tribhuvan University (TU), where the joint anthropology and sociology department was founded in 1981. Some Nepali anthropologists were also trained in universities in the US, Europe, Japan and elsewhere. However, there has been no similar growth regarding the set of non-Nepali historians researching on Nepal. I can’t think of even five non-Nepali researchers who have completed their PhDs in history conducting research related to Nepal in the past 25 years. I am aware of Bernardo Michael (2001, University of Hawaii at Manoa) and Catherine Warner (2014, University of Washington). Both worked on themes related to sovereignty and the Indo-Nepal border. If we want to be generous, we can also add Rhoderick Chalmers to this group, who finished a dissertation in 2003 in a different department at SOAS, University of London, by analysing the formation of the Nepali public sphere in British India between 1914 and 1940. Similarly, Browen Bledsoe finished a dissertation in 2004 at the Department of South Asian Languages and Civilisations at the University of Chicago, working on the inscriptions of the Kathmandu Valley. There must be a few other foreign colleagues who have done doctoral work related to the histories of Nepal in the past 25 years from departments in Indology or literature. There are several reasons why very few non-Nepalis have done history PhDs on themes related to Nepal. The primary reason is related to the structuring of the job market in the field of South Asian history outside of the region itself. While many scholars might be intellectually attracted to doing historical research on Nepal, they soon realise that it is very difficult to obtain academic jobs in the field of history having done doctoral research on Nepal since preference for such jobs is given to folks who have done research on colonial or medieval/ancient India. Take for example the case of the British historian of modern Nepal, John Whelpton. He finished his PhD in history at SOAS, University of London, in 1987. His doctoral research focused on the political history of Nepal between the years 1830 and 1857. In particular, he studied the rise of Jung Bahadur Rana as the national dada. However, even before he finished his PhD, Whelpton had already figured out that getting a regular job as an academic teaching South Asian history would be difficult for a modern Nepal specialist. Hence, he took some time off from dissertation writing to obtain a diploma in the “Teaching of English Overseas”. As he told me recently, this he did as an “insurance policy.” After applying unsuccessfully to academic jobs, Whelpton moved to Hong Kong in 1987 and started to work as an English teacher during the day and a Nepal researcher in the evenings. Things have not changed much in the subsequent years. In the large landscape of American higher education, there are exactly three academic historians of Nepal with tenure: Mark Liechty at the University of Illinois in Chicago (his 1994 PhD is in anthropology, but he has a joint appointment in the history department), Bernardo Michael at Messiah University, and Sanjog Rupakheti at College of the Holy Cross (2012 PhD from Rutgers University). As far as I know, no academic historians of Nepal hold tenured positions in the UK, France, Germany and Japan. RepercussionsThe situation regarding the major absence of non-Nepali historians researching the history of Nepal has been further compounded by the fact that in Nepal, apart from TU and Nepal Sanskrit University (NSU), MA or PhD degree training in the discipline of history has not been available in our newer universities. The number of NSU graduates in history is small, meaning graduate-degree oriented training in history has been limited to TU. This has resulted in inbreeding and a lack of institutional diversity in producing historians. This situation is not very healthy for the social life of the discipline of history since diversity in institutional settings and research approaches is essential for the continued vitality of the subject.Had there been many videshi historians researching the histories of Nepal, then this inbreeding in TU would not have been a major problem. The foreign historians would have brought their national and institutional traditions of historical scholarship to bear on their work on Nepal. They would have also brought a variety of analytical perspectives and approaches. But that has not happened, and this situation is not likely to change anytime soon for the reason discussed earlier. A partial saving grace has been the work of historically minded videshi anthropologists from various countries. I have in mind the work of the late Richard Burghart, Veronique Bouillier, Mary Des Chene, Stephen Mikesell, and several others. But their work has not captured the attention of Nepali historians. Additional mitigation has come from the historical research being done by academics trained in other disciplines (such as Indology and sociology) or in non-university based institutions (for example, Samshodhan Mandal). If new foreign academics are not doing doctoral work in history on Nepal and inbreeding is a problem, then what can we do? First, TU should hire Nepali historians trained in institutions outside of Nepal to revitalise its Master’s and PhD programmes in history. Such a possibility is more viable today than 20 years ago since several Nepalis have either just finished or are about to finish PhDs in history at different universities in other countries. TU could also consider headhunting individuals who have done important historical research but have higher degrees in other disciplines. But given its bureaucratic nature, I don’t expect this to happen anytime soon.Second, other Nepali universities should start graduate programmes in history. In this regard, the recent MOU signed between Kathmandu University and the Southasia Institute for History and Philosophy to explore the possibility of running a Master’s programme in history and philosophy is welcome news. Third, more Nepalis should pursue PhDs in history in good universities in India, the US, UK and other countries so that we have a much larger pool of formally trained historians with diverse institutional and intellectual backgrounds. Despite the general decimation of public universities in India, there are still several history departments in Indian universities where you can get decent training. Several universities in the UK have good history departments, but the funding for foreign students has mostly dried up. History departments in many good American universities do tend to support their doctoral students with financial aid. So prospective Nepali graduate students should check out some possibilities there. \nCyber-attacks on the government and significant business websites are as much a reality as physical insurgency and terrorist attacks. The latest cyber ransomware attack in Uttarakhand on 2 October 2024 brought the State Government machinery virtually to a halt. More than 90 major websites of the Uttarakhand Government, inter alia CM Helpline, ‘Apni Sarkar’, ‘E-Office’, ‘E-Ravanna portal, Chardham registration, and Land Registry were compromised.The Uttarakhand Government’s data centre was hacked, crippling the State’s entire Information Technology infrastructure. This attack, apparently, captured the State’s Information Technology Development Agency (ITDA) server, holding the critical data of crores of people and sensitive government departments, including the office of the Chief Minister, and demanded a ransom. It was no less than paralysing the State Government. One week later, on October 10 2024, the Uttarakhand Government announced that there had been no data loss. However, several critical questions loom large.Cyber experts view it from multiple lenses rather than as mere ransomware attacks or from the perspective of data recovery. The government’s preparedness to combat such a massive cyberattack is under question and accountability is at stake. The data of the last three years, curated by various State and non-State agencies further reflect a vulnerability of the Indian cyber system. For instance, till date in 2024, India has witnessed 388 data breaches, 107 data leaks, 39 ransomware activities, and 59 cases of access sales or leaks. We also sustained nearly 5 billion cyberattacks in 2023.Approximately, 50 government websites were hacked, and there were around eight incidents of data breaches in 2022-2023. In an alarming case, India’s weak cyber security architectural plan and IT infrastructure was exposed two years ago, when in 2022, AIIMS Delhi succumbed to a ransomware attack, compromising critical healthcare services for almost two weeks. This was probably one of the worst setbacks for Indian cyber security infrastructure in recent times.It was a clear signal for governments to envision a clear roadmap to prevent such mishaps in future. However, it seems Uttarakhand overlooked it for want of vision. There seems no plausible answer why the Uttarakhand Government does not have a proper cyber crisis management plan. More so because two years ago, the same Government of Uttarakhand, tasked ITI Limited, in Bengaluru to craft a disaster recovery plan. But it seems the matter has been in cold storage since then. It never saw the light of the day. Probably the government has so far treated cyber security as another welfare scheme which is announced during elections and forgotten until the next term. If this is the case, then we are heading for a bigger aftermath of a disaster after the data breach.A prudent cyber expert’s mind may ask what prevented the State Government from implementing a plan in the last two years? Given the escalating number of global cyberattacks, the State Government urgently needs more specific regulations, guidelines, procedures, or standard operating procedures (SOPs) to combat these crimes. Immediate policy changes and the implementation of effective measures to counter cyber threats are not just necessary but crucial. As we probe this disaster, a Pandora’s box of questions seems to open up. How could the state government overlook recruiting more subject matter experts for the Information Technology Development Agency (ITDA), in contrast to the existing team of three members, who are not even subject matter experts? As it appears, Data backup, a fundamental practice in cybersecurity, was not previously implemented, raising serious concerns about the State’s risk management strategies.There also seems to be a callous approach of the Government of Uttarakhand in firmly conducting a timely security audit of the ‘State Date Centre’. Non-establishment of the cyber security task force till date calls for another alarm in this scenario. While now the State Government has filed an FIR under section 308(4)(extortion) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sahinta, 2023 and 65/66/66C of the IT Act, 2000, there is a dire need for an overhaul of Uttarakhand’s cyber security basic architectural design, recruitment of subject matter experts, inviting consultants on board, setting up cyber security nodal officers in every department, rigorous and continuous training and constant engagement for evolving a cyber-security plan because such attacks may happen again.Precaution is the best cure. A half-baked cyber security plan cannot ensure the safety and security of the residents of Uttarakhand. Uttarakhand is known for cloud burst disasters and 2 October perhaps will be remembered as the Uttarakhand’s Cyber Security Cloud Burst, till a robust plan is placed on the table. It is quite evident that the Uttarakhand Government could not smell or see this coming despite enough reportage of cybercrimes across the country.It was knocking on our doors, and we opened our door wide open, then shooting the ransomware to mitigate the damage. A healthy dialogue between cyber experts and the Government is now warranted for a future roadmap that may not only help rebuild Uttarakhand from the crisis and may even serve as a model for other States to borrow from.-The Statesman (India)/ANN \nThe Bagmati provincial government has made a decision that undercuts the foundation of the provincial system. A Cabinet meeting of the provincial council of ministers led by Chief Minister Bahadur Singh Lama on Tuesday decided to split a ministry to create a portfolio for Madu Kumar Shrestha, who had been serving without portfolio after Lama was elected chief minister and formed a Cabinet in July. This decision has come at a time when the victims of the floods and landslides triggered by incessant rains in the last week of September have been left in the lurch for a month and a half. The government of the province which is worst hit by the disaster has taken a decision to bifurcate a ministry and add liability to state coffers when the displaced people don’t even have proper temporary shelters. Elderly people, children, pregnant women and chronic patients have been forced to stay under tarpaulins. There is no place for children to study as their schools have been ravaged by devastating landslides and floods. This is happening while the provincial government should have concentrated its resources to shift the displaced people to safe temporary huts.When the country’s two biggest parties—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—agreed in the first week of July to join hands to run a coalition government, they said their top priorities would be to end instability, do away with unhealthy practices and anomalies seen in forming and running governments in the provinces and ensure good governance. As the two biggest parties running a government was in itself something unusual in the parliamentary system, they described the country’s present state of affairs as extraordinary, requiring extraordinary measures to resolve them. Political parties in Kathmandu are infamous for doing everything to reach power. The activities of the parties at the provincial level are worse. In the past few years, the inter-party wrangling took such an ugly form that disputes over making and breaking governments in two provinces—Koshi and Gandaki—reached the court, multiple times.There are various groups in Nepal that are unhappy over the adoption of the federal system and devolution of centralised powers to provinces and local governments. At the time of constitution promulgation in 2015, the provincial governments were expected to work hard, connect themselves to the common people who had no access to the central government in Kathmandu and prove that the subnational administrations really listen to public grievances. Unfortunately, the performance of the provinces in the past decade has left a bad impression. Provinces are so unpopular that people have started to say that they would accept a two-tier federal system but not the provinces. Such a voice has become increasingly prominent even as federalism without provinces would be a system without a soul. At a time the provinces are under such scrutiny, chief ministers need to form small and smart Cabinets, restrain from unnecessary expenditures, explore innovative and exemplary practices that would in turn garner public support and build a stronger case for strengthening the federal system. But the decisions like the one Bagmati Province took on Tuesday will do just the opposite: Add to people’s already growing scepticism of the provinces.  \nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz urged Russian President Vladimir Putin in a rare phone call on Friday to begin talks with Ukraine that would open the way for a “just and lasting peace”.In a one-hour phone conversation, their first in almost two years, Scholz also demanded the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine and reaffirmed Germany’s continued support for Ukraine, a German government spokesman said.The call comes as Ukraine faces increasingly difficult conditions on the battlefield amid shortages of arms and personnel while Russian forces make steady advances.“The Chancellor urged Russia to show willingness to enter talks with Ukraine with the aim of achieving a just and lasting peace” the spokesperson said in a statement.“He stressed Germany's unbroken determination to back Ukraine in its defence against Russian aggression for as long as necessary,” the spokesperson added.Scholz spoke with Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy ahead of his call with Putin and would brief the Ukrainian leader on the outcome afterwards, the spokesperson said.Germany is Ukraine’s largest financial backer and its largest provider of weapons after the United States, whose future support for Kyiv appears uncertain following Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election.Trump has repeatedly criticised the scale of Western financial and military aid to Ukraine and has suggested he can put a swift end to the war, without explaining how.Scholz and Putin last spoke in December 2022, 10 months after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, plunging relations with the West into their deepest freeze since the Cold War.Scholz, the most unpopular German chancellor on record, is preparing for a national election on February 23 in which his Social Democrats face stiff competition from left-wing and far-right parties that are critical of Germany's backing for Ukraine. \nChinese President Xi Jinping launched a week-long diplomatic blitz of South America on Thursday by inaugurating a massive deep-water port in Peru, a $1.3 billion investment by Beijing as it seeks to expand trade and influence on the continent.With China’s demand for agricultural goods and metals from Latin America growing, Xi will participate in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Lima then head to the Group of 20 summit in Rio de Janeiro next week, where he will also make a state visit to Brazil.Xi and Peruvian President Dina Boluarte participated on Thursday by video link in the opening of the Chancay port, about 80 kilometres (48 miles) north of Lima on the Pacific Ocean, and signed a deal to widen an existing free trade agreement.Xi said that Chancay, a 15-berth, deep-water port, was the successful start of a “21st century maritime Silk Road” and part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative, its modern revival of the ancient Silk Road trading route.“China is willing to work with the Peruvian side to take the Chancay project as a starting point to forge a new maritime-land corridor between China and Latin America and connect the Great Inca Trail,” Xi said, referring to a 15th century mountain network that joined the Inca empire.In an opinion article in the El Peruano state newspaper, Xi said the Chancay project would generate $4.5 billion in annual revenues, create more than 8,000 direct jobs and reduce the logistics costs of the Peru-China route by 20 percent.The China-controlled megaport was built by Cosco Shipping Ports (1199.HK), opens new tab and received $1.3 billion in Chinese investment for its first phase. China is expected to spend billions more as Beijing and Lima work to position it as a major shipping hub between Asia and South America.The first ship was due to set sail from Chancay next week, transporting Peruvian fruit to China, Mario Ocharan, Peruvian director of the Chancay Chamber of Commerce, said.China's main motivation for developing the megaport, according to Ocharan, was access to neighboring Brazil, where a new railway line is planned to carry Brazilian exports such as soybeans and iron ore to the port.The rail project is estimated to cost $3.5 billion, according to Mario de las Casas, corporate affairs manager at Cosco Shipping Chancay Peru.Building that link is \"crucial\" to improve transportation of soybeans as Brazil is the top seller of the commodity to China, he said.Geopolitical and Economic HeadwindsThe inauguration of the port comes as Beijing is looking to further tap into resource-rich Latin America, amid trade tensions with Europe and concerns about future US tariffs on Chinese exports from the incoming Trump administration.Hundreds of Chinese business executives have accompanied Xi on this trip including heads of companies heavily invested in Peru such as Chinalco, which owns the Toromocho copper mine.Robert Evan Ellis, Latin America research professor at the US Army War College, said that Chancay will make shipping between Latin America and China more efficient.Because the port can handle the biggest ships, it will reduce the need for shippers to consolidate cargo containers at intermediary points, reducing costs and handling times.\"Chancay illustrates how China seeks secure access to resources and markets and its ever more successful fight to corner global value added,” Ellis said.China's major investment in Chancay has raised alarm bells in Washington. General Laura Richardson, former US Southern Command chief, warned earlier this month that Chancay could be used by the Chinese navy and for intelligence-gathering.US anxieties about Chancay reflect a broader, decades-long shift in a region Washington long saw as its backyard. China has overtaken the United States to become the largest trading partner of countries like Peru.China's state-backed Global Times wrote in an editorial on Monday that the port was \"by no means a tool for geopolitical competition\", calling U.S. accusations of the port's potential military use \"smears\".Chinese President Xi Jinping reviews the honour guard alongside Peru's President Dina Boluarte after arriving at the government palace, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, in Lima, Peru November 14, 2024.  \nStar Sports has officially secured the broadcasting rights for the Nepal Premier League (NPL), as announced by the Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) on Friday.Previously, there were informal reports suggesting that CAN was in talks with Star Sports for the league’s live coverage. The agreement has now been formalised, ensuring wide reach and exposure for the inaugural edition of NPL.The first edition of the franchise-based tournament is scheduled to take place from November 30 to December 21 and will feature eight teams. These teams represent various provinces, with two teams from Bagmati Province and one each from other regions.The competing teams include Kathmandu Gurkhas, Chitwan Rhinos, Biratnagar Kings, Janakpur Bolts, Pokhara Avengers, Karnali Yaks, and Sudurpashchim Royals.

She has significantly contributed to water purification and sanitation in Nepal and has actively advocated for improved water quality among policymakers and the general public.“Receiving the award has great value in my scientific career,” she said. “I strongly believe that this award would not only strengthen my research capacity but also inspire so many young researchers to achieve more in the advancement of sciences.”Assistant Professor Bipeen Dahal from the Central Department of Chemistry at Tribhuvan University won the TWAS-Atta-ur-Rahman Award, sponsored by The Searle Company Ltd, with a prize of US$5,000.He was recognised for his “contributions to the synthesis of carbon nanomaterials, including carbon quantum dots and their composites, for applications in energy conversion and storage, as well as addressing environmental issues.”Dahal specialises in carbon-based nanocomposite materials for energy storage and separation science. His research aims to address environmental challenges and advance green energy technologies.“It was an honour to receive this award,” Dahal said. “The knowledge and working experience in electrocatalysis and green energy storage further strengthened my research career in this field.”These achievements by Nepali scientists highlight the country’s growing presence in global scientific research and its contributions to addressing pressing environmental and sustainability challenges.The TWAS (The World Academy of Sciences) Awards are prestigious international accolades recognising excellence in scientific research and innovation in developing countries. Established in 1983 by TWAS, the awards aim to encourage and honour scientists who have made significant contributions to the advancement of science and technology, especially in areas relevant to the development of their countries. \nSocial media platform Bluesky is adding millions of users as people flee X after Donald Trump was elected US President and as an upcoming change to the terms of service threatens to complicate legal challenges for the Elon Musk-owned platform.Bluesky has gained about 2.5 million new users in the past week, raising its total users to more than 16 million, it said on Thursday. It is among a slew of apps looking to replace the platform formerly known as Twitter after Musk’s takeover.“We’re seeing record-high activity levels across all different forms of engagement: likes, follows, new accounts, etc, and we’re on track to add 1 million new users in one day alone,” Bluesky said in a statement.Several well-known organizations and personalities, including the nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate, British news publisher the Guardian and former CNN anchor Don Lemon have said they were leaving X due to concerns about the platform’s content and the looming terms change.X was called out by misinformation experts during the election for playing a central role in enabling the spread of false information about the critical battleground states.On November 6, as news broke that Musk ally Trump won the presidency, X attracted 46.5 million visits in the US - more than any day in the past year and 38% higher than an average day in recent months, according to analytics firm SimilarWeb. But more than 115,000 US web visitors deactivated their X accounts – the most since Musk bought the platform, SimilarWeb data showed.Bluesky's website, meanwhile, attracted around 1.2 million visitors on Nov.6, more than Meta Platforms-owned Threads, which had around 950,000 visitors. But Threads app had more visitors than that of Bluesky.“Outsized growth, particularly for Bluesky, may have been driven by a rise of controversial content or technical issues on competitor X,” said Abraham Yousef, senior insights analyst at market intelligence firm Sensor Tower.“The departure of popular accounts, media personalities, or organizations, may have led consumers to conclude that X is no longer their preferred platform, which could also be fueling growth on other platforms, particularly Bluesky and Threads.”TERMS CHANGEThe Bluesky surge comes ahead of a change in X’s terms on Friday that requires all legal disputes related to the platform to be brought exclusively in the US District Court for the Northern District of Texas or state courts in Tarrant County, Texas.The Center for Countering Digital Hate said on Thursday the change could hinder legal challenges against the platform by steering future lawsuits toward judges Musk believes “will be on his side”.“Now, the billionaire will be able to bring lawsuits to friendly courts against whoever disagrees with him on his platform,” said the nonprofit that has faulted Musk for letting hate speech spread on X.X and Musk did not respond to requests for comment.Still, Bluesky’s user count is much smaller than rivals. Threads has about 252 million monthly active users on its mobile app, while X has about 317 million, according to Sensor Tower.“X seems to be in a better position than it has in a while given the ability to represent the views of president-elect Trump,” said D.A. Davidson & Co analyst Gil Luria.“While there are other competing platforms, those may have a hard time catching up with X, since microblogging has significant network effects.” \nThe Public Health Ministry has urged the public to eat healthily and exercise regularly to minimise the risk of diabetes, a deadly disease that plagues over 6.5 million Thais, or about one tenth of the population.Speaking on the occasion of World Diabetes Day on Thursday (November 14), minister Somsak Thepsutin said that more than 90% of diabetes patients in Thailand are type 2, and some 40% do not know that they are diabetic.Type 2 diabetes is a common condition that causes the level of sugar (glucose) in the blood to become too high. It can cause symptoms like excessive thirst, needing to urinate a lot and tiredness, but many people have no symptoms.“To stay safe from the rising threat of diabetes, Thai people are advised to maintain healthier behaviour. One of the easiest tricks is to count the amount of carbohydrates in their daily meals to reduce the risk of diabetes and other non-communicable diseases,” he said.Somsak added that the ministry has instructed the village health volunteer network to teach locals the carb counting practices, as well as encourage people to eat a variety of foods, with an emphasis on low-sugar vegetables and fruits, and exercise regularly.Dr Panumas Yanwetsakul, director-general of the Department of Disease Control (DDC), said that this year, the International Diabetes Federation has set the theme for World Diabetes Day as “Diabetes and Well-Being”, with a focus on ensuring that patients have a good quality of life and happiness by managing their physical, mental, and social health, even while living with diabetes.“Diabetes affects the quality of life of patients physically, mentally and socially because individuals with diabetes face challenges in managing their self-care to maintain proper blood sugar levels,” said Panumas.“They must also manage potential complications, such as cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, diabetic retinopathy (vision loss due to damage to the retina), diabetic foot ulcers caused by nerve damage and poor blood circulation in the extremities. These conditions can lead to infections, which may be severe enough to require amputation,” she said.Panumas advised diabetes patients and those at risk to take care of their physical health by eating a healthy diet, avoiding salty and oily foods, as well as cigarettes and alcohol, and engaging in regular physical activity to reduce risks. The recommended amount is at least 30 minutes per day or 150 minutes per week.They must also manage their mental health by fostering good mental well-being, adopting a positive outlook, and reducing stress and anxiety that may arise from the continuous need for self-care, she added.The DDC chief said diabetics should also improve their social health by participating in social activities to build positive relationships with those around them, even while taking special care of their own health.-In Association with ANN \nSri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake’s leftist coalition won a thumping victory in a snap general election, gaining power to push through his plans to fight poverty in the island nation recovering from a financial meltdown.Dissanayake’s Marxist-leaning National People’s Power (NPP) coalition won 137 seats of 196 for which direct elections were held, a two-thirds majority, Friday’s ballot counting showed. Local media projected its tally would cross 150 in the 225-member parliament after more seats are distributed under a proportional seat distribution system.That would give Dissanayake sweeping powers to even abolish the contentious executive presidency as he has planned.While the clear mandate strengthens political stability in the South Asian country, some uncertainty on policy direction remains due to Dissanayake’s promises to try and tweak the International Monetary Fund (IMF) rescue programme that bailed the country out of its economic crisis, analysts said.Dissanayake, a political outsider in a country dominated by family parties for decades, comfortably won the island's presidential election in September.But his coalition had just three seats in parliament before Thursday’s snap election, prompting him to dissolve it and seek a fresh mandate.The NPP secured almost 62% or almost 7 million votes in Thursday’s election, up from the 42% Dissanayake won in September, indicating that he had drawn more widespread support including from minorities and built on his victory.“We see this as a critical turning point for Sri Lanka. We expect a mandate to form a strong parliament, and we are confident the people will give us this mandate,” Dissanayake said after casting his vote on Thursday.“There is a change in Sri Lanka’s political culture that started in September, which must continue.”Voters directly elect 196 members to parliament from 22 constituencies under a proportional representation system. The remaining 29 seats will be distributed according to the island-wide proportional vote obtained by each party.TENTATIVE ECONOMIC RECOVERYCelebrations were largely muted, with the exception of a few NPP loyalists who lit fireworks on the outskirts of the capital, Colombo.The Samagi Jana Balawegaya party of opposition leader Sajith Premadasa, the main challenger to Dissanayake’s coalition, won 35 seats and the New Democratic Front, backed by previous President Ranil Wickremesinghe, won just three seats.Sri Lanka typically backs the president’s party in general elections, especially if voting is held soon after a presidential vote.The president wields executive power but Dissanayake still required a parliamentary majority to appoint a fully-fledged cabinet and deliver on key promises to cut taxes, support local businesses, and fight poverty.A nation of 22 million, Sri Lanka was crushed by a 2022 economic crisis triggered by a severe shortage of foreign currency that pushed it into a sovereign default and caused its economy to shrink by 7.3% in 2022 and 2.3% last year.Boosted by a $2.9 billion bailout programme from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the economy has begun a tentative recovery, but the high cost of living is still a critical issue for many, especially the poor.Dissanayake also aims to tweak targets set by the IMF to rein in income tax and free up funds to invest in welfare for the millions hit hardest by the crisis.But investors worry his desire to revisit the terms of the IMF bailout could delay future disbursements, making it harder for Sri Lanka to hit a key primary surplus target of 2.3% of GDP in 2025 set by the IMF.“The country has given a clear mandate politically. The key question would be if this is at the cost of economic policy,” said Raynal Wickremeratne, co-head of research at Softlogic Stockbrokers in Colombo.“I think with this majority they may try to negotiate a bit more on the (IMF) targets as well,” he said. “A continuation of the current reform programme on a broader extent would be positive for the country.” \nPresident Paudel returned to Nepal after attending COP-29 in Azerbaijan, highlighting climate change impacts and seeking commitments from developed nations.\nWith Trump's return to the White House, his \"America First\" policy may guide US foreign policy, potentially impacting Nepal's relations and the overall dynamics of South Asia, given Trump's close ties with India and the evolving US-China-India power play.\nNepal's major international airport's ten-hour closure from Friday for expansion will have significant economic impacts, particularly on tourism, transportation, and other sectors, leading to revenue losses and a potential setback to economic recovery.\nAmid global geopolitical shifts, Nepal's PM Oli plans to visit China in early December, potentially setting a precedent and raising questions about India's \"Neighborhood First\" policy and its handling of Nepal's foreign relations.\nPrime Minister Oli has faced setbacks in implementing several plans, including removing the Deputy Speaker, introducing an ordinance on party splits, and accepting a donation for the party's new headquarters, highlighting his diminished authority since becoming prime minister.\n\n\nRae was the envoy to Kathmandu during the promulgation of the 2015 constitution and the subsequent blockade. In this conversation, Rae talks about the evolution of Nepal-India ties since the blockade, regional geopolitics, what the two countries get wrong about each other, how New Delhi views Nepali communist parties and the governments they lead, and the change (if any) in India’s neighbourhood policy since the start of Narendra Modi’s third term in office. \nKunwar has been the MD for just under three years. Before coming back to her homeland to join Daraz Nepal, she worked at different American companies, including Amazon, the world’s biggest e-commerce platform.

You’ve published seven poetry books. Can you describe in brief what these books are about?I regularly write English poems and submit them to journals and magazines. Once published, I collect them into books. My first book explored self-reflection in a romantic, lyrical style, and I write primarily in free verse with a philosophical touch.In my second book, the poems critique literature, time, and politics with a more concise style. My third book delves into themes of mentality, humanity, love, peace, remorse, discernment, grief, loss, and redemption.The fourth book is rich in symbolism, touching on themes like war, death, travel, memory, and honouring ancestors. My fifth book is entirely free verse, featuring an experimental style focused on spontaneity and setting. My sixth book brings simplicity to abstract ideas, with some poems addressing contemporary issues.The seventh book incorporates mythical and spiritual themes. The title poem suggests that modernity and tradition coexist in Kathmandu. You went to Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU). How has studying literature in two different cultural contexts influenced your writing?At JNU, I came to appreciate the value of one’s own culture. Assigned to write a term paper on Nepal’s counterculture, I immersed myself in a range of global subjects, including world literature, German philosophy, Greco-Roman mythopoesis, science fiction, American and Jewish literature, and caste-related literature.India’s emphasis on cultural heritage inspired me, and I am now drawn to Nepalese Writings in English, much like Indian Writings in English, which are widely studied in India. My work reflects a deep respect for culture. As a global language, English allows us to tell Nepal’s stories.As a poet, flash fiction, and short story writer, how do you decide which medium best expresses a particular idea or emotion?A poem can distil any literary idea into a concise form, using symbolism and artistry to reflect the essence of any era. Poetry has a unique power to emotionally connect with readers, though it often leans toward subjectivity. When I want to incorporate diverse perspectives or create a new fictional world, I turn to stories and flash fiction, as flash fiction allows for rich character sketches in brief.Do you have specific rituals or environments that help you write?I write poems wherever inspiration strikes—on buses, aeroplanes, hotel rooms, and airport lobbies. When an idea comes to mind, I write it down, often late at night, capturing at least one poem before the day ends. I don’t need a peaceful writing setting; travel especially fuels my creativity. For instance, while walking the streets of Kathmandu, the idea for my poem ‘Finding My Soul in Kathmandu’ emerged. I later returned to my hotel room and wrote it. Do you believe there is a responsibility for poets today to address social or political issues, or is poetry more about personal expression?Poets are responsible for addressing social and political issues respectfully and sensitively. Writing provocatively about controversial topics doesn’t necessarily improve reality. Instead, poetry should elevate personal concerns into universal themes, using literary devices to deepen impact. For instance, I recently wrote a poem inspired by the floods just before festival season. The poem was abstract rather than literal; I used the image of a “tattered kite” to symbolise the suffering of flood victims.Poetry isn’t a straightforward report of events—it thrives on subjectivity and imagination. In today’s world, war poetry, reflecting our times, feels particularly urgent. Poets can’t ignore current realities. I’ve written poems about the effects of Covid-19 and lockdowns, aiming to resonate with readers’ experiences. When poetry reflects how events like the pandemic have touched people’s lives, it becomes relatable.The symbolic poem ‘Parrot in the Cage’ is a powerful example of opposing political repression. Poetry, at its best, is a symbolic medium, and it’s in this artful representation that the actual skill of a poet lies. What advice would you give aspiring poets?Aspiring poets should immerse themselves in literature and actively pursue publication opportunities. Young poets can also benefit from translating poems into English to grasp the subtleties of language. Exploring the lyrics and poetry of musicians like Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen can be equally enriching. Poets need to engage with the world around them and broaden their perspectives.Sushant Thapa’s book recommendationsCrime and Punishment Author: Fyodor DostoyevskyPublisher: Simon & SchusterYear: 1866This thrilling page-turner feels personal to the reader.

Does Nepal’s Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli fit the same mould as Modi and Trump?Indian political scientist Pratap Bhanu Mehta, for one, does not think so. Mehta said Indian Prime Minister Modi and newly elected American President Donald Trump were ‘populist’ leaders, but he declined to give the same tag to Oli, the chair of CPN-UML.Answering a question about Oli’s ‘populist tendencies’, Mehta replied, “As I don’t see radical anti-elitism in Nepal, and the political leaders are comfortably maintaining the status quo around the elite structure, there is no populist leader in the present power structure of Nepal,” Mehta said.Mehta was speaking at a session titled ‘The Wave of Populism’ hosted by the Post’s Editor Biswas Baral in the Kantipur Conclave in Kathmandu on Wednesday. Mehta also claimed that with the election of Donald Trump as the US President, world politics might see the absence of norms. Trump, who was first elected President in 2016, has been accused of serving an ‘unpresidented’ term and many liberal journalists and public intellectuals around the world have expressed fear over what the businessman-politician’s second term would unleash.Trump has been accused of leading a racist campaign in the lead-up to the election; and Mehta said that it is one of the hallmarks of populism.“Feature of a certain kind of populism is to actually say that the nation has a kind of singular nationality and it should primarily be dominated by one particular group,” Mehta said.“Radical elements of anti-elitism” are the second feature of populism, Mehta added, whereas the prevalence of ethno-identity politics is the other feature.Indian Prime Minister Modi, who is trying to construct the singular ethno-national consciousness in the name of religion, is a populist leader, Mehta argued.Modi, a leader of Bharatiya Janata Party, has been ruling India for over 10 years after being elected as prime minister in 2014.Mehta said that while Modi has tried to mobilise the ethno-national identity to garner votes, the same strategy has not been used in Nepal.He also believes that instead of criticising populist leaders, traditional political parties should offer something other than the status quo to convince the public of their agenda. Mehta said that none of the world’s populist leaders have prioritised solving economic challenges.He cited examples of election strategies in both India and America, observing that “populist leaders do not prioritise economic challenges as campaign issues.” Mehta, however, said that some Latin American populist leaders have raised economic reform as part of their agendas.He explained that leaders like Modi in India and Trump in America often depict traditional structures as their adversaries. “In India, Modi portrays nepotism as one such adversarial structure,” Mehta said. \nPolice on Tuesday took Rastriya Swatantra Party chairman and former home minister Rabi Lamichhane to Bhairahawa in Rupandehi district from Pokhara for investigation.Although Lamichhane was initially scheduled to arrive by Buddha Air’s 7:45 am flight from Pokhara, poor weather delayed the departure until noon. The plane landed in Bhairahawa at 12:28 pm, after which Lamichhane was taken directly to the office of district attorney, according to Rupandehi district police.The office of the district attorney started recording Lamichhane’s statement at 1pm. District attorney Premraj Paudel and his team interrogated the RSP chief about his alleged involvement in cooperative fraud, organised crime, and money laundering. According to sources, Lamichhane denied involvement in the cooperative scam, claiming that he was unaware of deposits made in his name.Paudel said that the office of the district attorney would continue recording Lamichhane’s statement from 10am on Wednesday. According to him, around 20 questions were asked to Lamichhane on Tuesday, but his statement has yet to be transcribed.Talking briefly to the reporters while emerging from the office of the district attorney, Lamichhane said that “caging a tiger doesn’t turn it into a jackal,” implying that he remains unshaken.The former deputy prime minister is currently held in Kaski police custody on charges of cooperative fraud, organised crime, and money laundering. On Sunday, the Kaski District Court extended his detention by 13 days for further investigation.Previously, the Rupandehi District Court issued arrest warrants for 12 individuals, including Lamichhane and GB Rai, on October 24. The two are accused of misappropriating Rs142.9 million from Supreme Cooperative and diverting it to Gorkha Media Network Pvt Ltd. Investigations indicate that Lamichhane had borrowed Rs19.6 million in personal loans from the cooperative.Further probes revealed that Gorkha Media Network’s vice chairman, Chhabilal Joshi Banjade, took an additional Rs24.5 million loan, which was transferred to Gorkha Media’s Global IME Bank account. Records show Supreme Cooperative’s manager, Sagar KC, authorised a loan voucher for Lamichhane, with Roshani Gurung allegedly moving funds into Gorkha Media’s account. Roshani has since been released on bail, while the cooperative’s chairman Om Prakash Gurung remains in custody.An investigation into Supreme Cooperative revealed Rs780 million of members’ deposits had been diverted to other organisations. Authorities believe over 32 individuals, including former chairman GB Rai, former secretary Dipesh Pun, and KC, were involved in the embezzlement, with 25 still at large.In January, police issued a red notice for GB Rai, who is still at large. Rai and Lamichhane co-founded Gorkha Media Network, the company behind the now-defunct Galaxy 4K Television. Lamichhane served as managing director of the channel before joining politics in July 2022.RSP activists stage demonstrationRSP activists and supporters staged demonstrations in Bhairahawa on Tuesday. They gathered at Buddhachowk to protest the arrest of their party chief, Lamichhane. The protesters demanded immediate release of Lamichhane. The RSP activists and supporters earlier protested in front of Gautam Buddha International Airport. They had gathered at the airport area early in the morning.Victims of cooperative fraud demonstrate in BhairahawaAfter RSP chair Lamichhane was brought to Bhairahawa for investigation, victims of cooperative fraud in Rupandehi took out a protest march.The demonstration took place at Buddha Chowk and near the District Attorney’s Office in the district headquarters of Bhairahawa, with victims demanding the return of their deposited funds.Gathering under the banner of the Supreme Cooperative Victims’ Group, protesters assembled near the entrance of the District Court in Burmeli Tole, chanting slogans such as “Give justice to cooperative victims,” “No more cooperative fraud,” and “Conduct an impartial investigation into cooperative fraud.”Over 50 victims participated in the protest, which, according to Cooperative Victims Struggle Committee chair Bijay Nepal, extended from the court entrance to the District Attorney’s Office. \nThe Supreme Court has ordered its administration to accept contempt of court petitions against two dozen Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) leaders for their alleged involvement in obstructing judicial proceedings.Scrapping the decision of joint registrar Achyut Kuikel to reject the petition against the RSP leadership, a single bench of Justice Binod Sharma on Tuesday ordered its administration to register it. Advocate Anupam Bhattarai, on October 30, had reached the court with the petition demanding penalty against top RSP leaders and lawmakers for their alleged contempt of court. Kuikel, however, had refused the petition claiming that it failed to substantiate the defendants’ acts that were contemptuous of court.Bhattarai last week moved the top court against Kuikel's decision. Justice Sharma then allowed him to register the petition.“The court has allowed me to proceed with the petition. I will register it tomorrow [Wednesday],” said Bhattarai. His petition claims that the RSP leadership has been trying to defame the judiciary and create a barrier to justice delivery through regular demonstrations and protests against the arrest of Rabi Lamichhane, the party president.RSP leaders and cadres have been hitting the streets ever since Lamichhane was arrested on October 19 on cooperative fraud and organised crime. Bhattarai has claimed their act is against Article 128(4) of the Constitution of Nepal. In case anyone causes obstruction in the dispensation of justice or disregards any order or judgement handed down by it or any of its subordinate courts, the court may, in accordance with the law, initiate proceedings of contempt, says the constitutional provision.All the central committee leaders including vice-presidents Dol Prasad Aryal and Swarnim Wagle and most lawmakers including Sumana Shrestha and Sobhita Gautam were defendants in the petition that was rejected. RSP provincial leaders, who are hitting the streets, too, are the defendants. Bhattarai will register the same petition.Under the leadership of Aryal and Wagle, the RSP carried out a series of protests in Pokhara where police are investigating the charges against the RSP head. The court has extended his remand multiple times, most recently until November 23.On Tuesday, he was transferred to Bhairahawa from Pokhara after Rupandehi District Court also issued an arrest warrant for his alleged involvement in embezzling millions of rupees from the Butwal-based Supreme Cooperative. The RSP leaders and cadres have staged protests against the arrest in Bhairahawa as he was taken there.The Rupandehi District Court previously issued arrest warrants for 12 individuals, including Lamichhane and GB Rai, on October 24. The two are accused of misappropriating Rs142.9 million from Supreme Cooperative and diverting it to Gorkha Media Network Pvt Ltd. Investigations indicate Lamichhane had borrowed Rs19.6 million in personal loans from the cooperative.Further probes revealed that Gorkha Media Network vice-chairman Chhabilal Joshi Banjade took an additional Rs24.5 million loan, which was transferred to Gorkha Media’s Global IME Bank account. Records show Supreme Cooperative’s manager, Sagar KC, authorised a loan voucher for Lamichhane, with Roshani Gurung allegedly moving funds into Gorkha Media’s account. Roshani has since been released on bail, while Cooperative chairman Om Prakash Gurung remains in custody.An investigation into Supreme Cooperative revealed that Rs780 million of members’ deposits had been diverted to other organisations. Authorities believe over 32 individuals, including former chairman GB Rai, former secretary Dipesh Pun, and KC, were involved in the embezzlement, with 25 still at large.RSP leaders can face jail terms along with fines if convicted of contempt. The Supreme Court Act, 1991 on Contempt of Supreme Court and subordinate courts states that Supreme Court may slap punishment of up to one year imprisonment or a fine up to Rs10,000 or both to the person convicted. \nSince the insurgency days, the Maoists have always been high on conspiracy theories, particularly when it comes to the United States, the superpower they once called an ‘imperialist’ force. The latest instance of this is Chairman of CPN (Maoist Centre) Pushpa Kamal Dahal raising the possibility of the current government pushing for Nepal to join the State Partnership Programme (SPP) proposed by the US government. Based on a media report that no other Maoist leader has seen, Dahal expressed his worry that Prime Minister Oli, who had earlier shown tentative support for the controversial US programme, might now give it his stamp of approval.Speaking at a press conference in Hetauda on Sunday, the three-time prime minister said, “There is something more concerning than the Millennium Challenge Compact [MCC]. It is called the SPP. It has been reported in the US media that the current prime minister has already given theoretical consent to the SPP, and the US government has also made it official. This is a matter of serious concern.”“This government can compromise on national interest to hold on to power,” Dahal further accused. “Theoretical consent is a serious matter in itself. Now, they could soon reach an agreement.”This is the second time Dahal has expressed concern over the Oli government’s possible endorsement of the SPP. Last month too, while addressing a rally organised by his party in Kathmandu on October 26, Dahal had suggested that the Oli government could move forward with the SPP, which was earlier rejected by the Sher Bahadur Deuba government in 2022 when Dahal’s party was a coalition partner.In addition to Dahal, senior vice chair of the Maoist Centre, Narayan Kaji Shrestha, addressing the same rally, had also raised concerns that the Oli government might have already given its nod to the SPP.When the Post asked Shrestha after the rally about the SPP, he said that although they had no concrete evidence, there were enough clues to worry.“I have heard that American media is reporting about the agreement between the two countries regarding the SPP, but I don’t have any concrete evidence to provide,” Shrestha, who served as foreign minister in the immediate past government, told the Post. When Maoist Centre spokesperson Agni Sapkota, the party’s vice chair, was asked about the claims regarding the SPP made by the two leaders of his party, Sapkota told the Post, “I have heard news about Nepal joining the SPP in American media; however, I also need to figure out on what basis the party's leadership is making such a claim.”The Post could get no convincing answer when it pressed these Maoist leaders to cite the concerned US media report that had allegedly published the piece on the SPP. Vijay Kant Karna, a foreign policy expert who had previously served as Nepal’s ambassador to Denmark on the Maoist Centre quota, says there is no chance that the present government will move forward with the SPP, as the previous government had rejected it. However, Karna says there would be no harm even if the government joined the SPP.“The SPP is all about involving army personnel in disaster management. We have seen how ill-equipped and unprepared our state agencies were during the monsoon havoc in September,” Karna told the Post. “Although the SPP is needed for disaster management in our country, I don’t think the present government would take it forward, unlike what the Maoist Centre leaders say.” Karna further says that Dahal, the leader of the main opposition party in the House of Representatives, has the right to seek a briefing from the secretary of the ministry concerned. “If the Maoist party has certain information about it, why haven’t they requested a briefing on the issue?” Officials at the foreign ministry also deny such a possibility. “The previous government already has made it clear that Nepal will not be part of the SPP, so there is no chance of the country being a part of it even now,” an official told the Post. “It is astonishing why the former prime minister has repeatedly claimed such developments.” Foreign policy experts say there is a competition among Nepali political parties to be close to foreign power centres, which may explain the latest statements by the leaders of the Maoist Centre. Yubraj Sangraula, a former attorney general and a staunch critic of the MCC Compact, also dismisses the possibility of the SPP gaining momentum. “This could be no more than a political stunt by the Maoist Centre.” Sangurala told the Post.“Had there been any progress on this, it would have come to light through various means,” Sangurala claimed. However, one of Dahal’s foreign policy advisers during his time as prime minister argued that the Maoist chief’s statement on the SPP can be understood in two contexts. “First, Nepal had requested the US to include it in the SPP in 2015 when Oli was prime minister. Second, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana has been extensively engaging with the Americans,” the former adviser, who tried to defend Dahal’s public statement, told the Post. However, leaders of the Congress and UML, the coalition partners, dismiss the Maoist claims.Even though Nepal had been writing to the US about participating in the SPP since 2015, it became a partner country in the SPP only in 2019. After the earthquake in 2015, Nepal had written to the US requesting participation in SPP for disaster management and humanitarian aid. Nepal wrote another letter in 2017 requesting the same. The US included Nepal as a participant in the SPP in 2019 only after the promulgation of the Indo-Pacific Strategy put forward by US President Donald Trump. However, there was no memorandum of understanding on it. When the US decided to include Nepal as an SPP member, Dahal, along with Oli, was co-chair of the Nepal Communist Party. This party was formed from a merger between the UML and Maoist Centre following the 2017 election, and the government was under their leadership. The issue of SPP first flared up in Nepal when the Commanding General of the US Army Pacific, Charles Flynn, during his Nepal visit in June 2022, urged Nepal to be a part of the SPP during his meeting with then Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and the former Army chief, General Prahnu Ram Sharma. Reportedly, the Deuba government also considered participating. Nepal’s “participation” in the SPP had become a hotly debated political issue, with political parties engaged in an acrimonious blame game. Prime Minister Deuba was put under pressure by the then main opposition, UML, and his own party, Congress, to terminate Nepal’s partnership with the SPP. After controversy erupted over Nepal's partnership in the SPP, the US embassy in Kathmandu also issued a press note saying that Nepal can terminate its participation in the SPP if it wishes to. Later, on June 20, 2022, a Cabinet decision terminated its participation in the SPP. The SPP is administered by the National Guard Bureau, guided by State Department foreign policy goals, and executed by each US state’s senior military officer to support the Department of Defense policy goals. “Through SPP, the National Guard conducts military-to-military engagements in support of defense security goals but also leverages whole-of-security relationships and capabilities to facilitate broader interagency and corollary engagements spanning military, government, economic, and social spheres,” the US National Guard website reads.  \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City has designated 47 locations for floriculturists and flower vendors to sell flowers in Tihar.The city office’s move aims to avoid the inconvenience the floral vendors faced last year and reduce congestion on the sidewalks.“This year, we have designated 47 locations, most of them in shopping malls, marts, parks and party palaces,” said Dharma Raj Bhandari, a police inspector at the city office. “Farmers and vendors can take their products to those designated places and do business at their convenience. Our staff will help them reach the designated areas if they can not do so on their own.”Last year, many floral farmers from the adjoining districts of the Kathmandu Valley who brought flowers in the capital city could not sell their products due to restrictions the city office imposed in many places.The farmers were then allowed to sell flowers at Bhrikutimandap, Tinkune park, Handigaun and Balaju Valley Cold Store in coordination with the Floriculture Association of Nepal and the Nepal Chamber of Commerce. However, farmers and vendors discarded piles of flowers and garlands on footpaths and returned home, incurring heavy losses.The metropolis had deployed its staffers, including the metropolis police, to collect discarded flowers and garlands, which were dumped at the landfill site in Bancharedanda.Officials say that the malls, party palaces and parks will not charge farmers and vendors for providing space for selling flowers and garlands. KMC officials discussed the matter with the owners of the malls and party palaces and requested them to provide spaces for farmers to sell flowers and garlands in Tihar.“Floral farmers and vendors can sell flowers from other private places, but we will not allow them to obstruct footpaths,” said Laxmi Maharjan, a senior assistant sub-inspector of the KMC. “This year, we designated specified sales points in advance to avoid repeating last year’s situation.”The metropolis has also requested that people use flowers produced by Nepali farmers in Tihar and prohibit the sale, storage, distribution and use of plastic bouquets and flowers.“We have already confiscated plastic bouquets and flowers from many places,” said Maharjan. “We will fine traders if they ignore our warnings.”The metropolis has asked floral farmers and vendors to call the hotline 1180 or 015901763 and 9851356509 for help. \nTen people were injured in a bus accident at Ghumaune in Kharipati of Bhaktapur district on Tuesday. Two are reportedly in critical condition.According to Pradeep Khatri, a traffic police inspector and chief of the District Traffic Police Range, the bus coming from Talakot of Changunarayan Municipality lost its control and hit a pole. The injured are undergoing treatment at Bhaktapur Hospital, police said. \nTraffic police have reintroduced the no-horn campaign in Kathmandu Valley to combat unnecessary honking.Officers carrying placards with “no-horn” messages are stationed at various intersections, urging drivers to refrain from honking.Deputy Superintendent of Police Rabin Karki, spokesperson for the Kathmandu Valley Traffic Police Office, said the campaign aims to curb noise pollution through stricter enforcement and public awareness.Despite Kathmandu being declared a horn-free zone in April 2017, rampant horn use continues. Karki said the Vehicle and Transport Management Act prohibits honking in restricted areas, classifying it as a traffic violation.Last fiscal year, 10,123 vehicles were fined for unnecessary honking. This year, 13,003 vehicles have already faced penalties. The awareness drive was relaunched on October 17.Karki explained that while normal hearing can tolerate up to 60 decibels, 70 decibels is harmful. Noise pollution causes hearing loss, high blood pressure, heart disease, strokes, respiratory issues, and memory loss. Loud motorcycles and vehicles with modified silencers or pressure horns are major contributors. The police are focusing on violators, with particular attention to the impact on pedestrians, especially children, the elderly, pregnant women, and those with health issues, Karki said. \nAs the Kathmandu Valley’s air quality is set to deteriorate in the coming days, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City is gearing up to start vehicle emission testing.For this, the city office has purchased a smoke meter (a portable device for testing vehicle emissions), which will be used in coordination with other stakeholders—the Metropolitan Traffic Police Division, the Department of Transport Management, and the Department of Environment.“Vehicle emission testing is mainly the responsibility of the agencies under the federal government, but the constitution has also given local governments the authority to take measures to reduce pollution,” said Sarita Rai, chief of the Environment Department. “We also have developed pollution control guidelines as per the KMC Environment and Natural Resources Protection Act-2021.”Officials say vehicle emission testing will start once the pollution control guidelines are published in the metropolis gazette. In the first phase, emissions of petrol and diesel vehicles operating in the metropolis will be randomly tested, and the city office has also planned to carry out emission testing for motorcycles.Emission testing will be carried out on vehicles that have passed emission testing from the Department of Transport Management and received green stickers. Officials say that vehicles with green stickers could still emit black smoke for various reasons, including lack of timely servicing and maintenance.“We have seen many vehicles with green stickers emitting black smoke,” an official at the Environment Department of the KMC said, asking not to be named as the official is not authorised to talk to the media. “Many automobile owners only service their vehicles ahead of the annual pollution testing.” Officials say that the amount of the fine will be determined based on the suggestions of stakeholders.Vehicle emission testing is among the measures the city office has been taking to reduce pollution levels in the metropolis.The KMC has also started independently monitoring the city's air quality, with support from the Partnership for Healthy Cities, which has provided 19 portable devices to the city office.The Partnership for Healthy Cities is a global network of 74 cities, including the Kathmandu metropolis, committed to saving lives by preventing noncommunicable diseases and injuries. The programme is supported by Bloomberg Philanthropies in partnership with the World Health Organisation and Vital Strategies.Nepal’s air quality reaches hazardous levels several times a year during winter and summer, and the capital city often ranks as the world’s most polluted metropolis. Major hospitals also report a spike in respiratory problems due to the impact of toxic air and dust. Doctors warn that people get sick from respiratory illnesses caused by polluted air throughout the year, due to polluted air.Doctors say air pollution is known to cause various respiratory illnesses. Poor air quality can cause short- and long-term effects on public health. In the short term, it can lead to pneumonia, bronchitis, conjunctivitis, skin allergy, stroke, and heart problems, and in the long run it can lead to severe conditions like ulcers, and cancer of the lungs and intestine, kidney disease, and heart complications.People in low- and middle-income countries get disproportionately affected by the polluted air, which accounts for more than 90 percent of deaths, according to the World Health Organisation.Several studies carried out in the past in Nepal show that toxic air takes a huge toll on public health. Along with respiratory illness, the toxic air has led to severe conditions like ulcers, cancer of the lungs and intestine, kidney disease, heart complications, high blood pressure and stroke, according to experts.The report, titled “Global burden and strength of evidence for 88 risk factors in 204 countries and 811 subnational locations, 1990–2021: A systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2021,” finds that air pollution was the leading contributor to the global disease burden in 2021, making for eight percent of total disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), followed by high blood pressure (7.8 percent). The report was published in The Lancet, a leading international medical journal.Studies carried out in the past show that polluted air has been shortening people’s lives. Nepali lives are being cut short by around five years, according to a report by the Air Quality Life Index (AQLI), which converts air pollution concentration into an impact on life expectancy. AQLI is a metric produced by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago.Toxic air is deadlier than tobacco use and high blood pressure, which reduce life by 2.8 years and 1.7 years, respectively, according to the report.Environment experts in Nepal often point out that worsening air quality has not only affected people’s health but also hit the economy and hindered overall development of the country. \nTicket bookings for public transport during the Dashain festival will open this Saturday. Following discussions with stakeholders, the Department of Transport Management announced that tickets will be available online and at counters to manage the expected surge of nearly two million travellers leaving the Kathmandu Valley for the festivities.According to the department’s Director General, Rajiv Pokharel, transport operators will facilitate online bookings. “We have instructed operators to arrange online bookings wherever possible,” he said. “For counter bookings, passengers must obtain tickets only from official staff wearing uniforms and identification badges.”Around two million people are estimated to leave the Kathmandu Valley during Dashain. The department has introduced 20-point directives to ensure safe and hassle-free travel. Key measures include mandatory checks for alcohol consumption by drivers at major entry and exit points and the requirement for two drivers on long-distance routes. Additionally, those under 18 cannot work as assistant drivers.To assist travellers during Dashain, Tihar, and Chhath festivals, citizen help desks will be established at major locations such as Nagdhunga, Kalanki, Swayambhu, Halchowk, Machhapokhari, Gongabu Bus Park, Chabahil, Tilganga, Koteshwar, Jagati, Satdobato, Balkhu, Dakshinkali, Sundhara, and Sangha in Kavre. An inspection team comprising officials from various agencies will monitor travel arrangements with support from provincial transport ministries.Public transport operating on long and medium-distance routes must follow a designated queue system. Transport expert Ashish Gajurel noted that although bookings are open each year, passengers face difficulties. \"Bus operators don’t increase the number of buses during Dashain, despite rising demand. Authorities must increase the number of buses to ease travel,\" he said.Saroj Sitaula, senior vice-president of the Federation of Nepalese National Transport Entrepreneurs, however, argued that ‘unnecessary’ vehicle checks should be avoided to prevent inconvenience for passengers and drivers. He also highlighted the need to repair potholes on roads to ensure smooth travel.Earlier, Minister for Physical Infrastructure and Transport Devendra Dahal instructed the Department of Roads to complete road repairs nationwide before Ghatasthapana, the first day of the 15-day Dashain festival. The department reported that repairs are underway but have been delayed by the monsoon.The Narayanghat-Butwal road section, part of the East-West Highway, remains a major concern, with only 52.7 percent of its upgrade completed after six years of construction and multiple deadline extensions. The Meteorological Forecasting Division of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology has predicted chances of rainfall in various places of the country for a couple of days more, raising concerns about travel difficulties during Dashain. Other problematic sections include Nagdhunga-Mugling and Mugling-Pokhara, with landslides and potholes reported along various highways, including the Mid-Hill, Madan Bhandari, Hulaki, and BP highways. \n\nThe bill committee of the Cabinet has given a nod to the civil aviation bills two months after they were tabled, allowing the government to table the long-pending legislation in the winter session of Parliament.According to a top official at the tourism ministry, the committee discussed the bills and suggested a few changes in wordings. “After the changes, the bills will be tabled in the Cabinet seeking its approval in principle to register them in the lower house of Parliament. Tabling the bills in the Cabinet after necessary amendments may take a few days.”The then Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government had put the bills into hibernation.On September 6, after being halted by the Dahal administration for over a year, the draft civil aviation bills made into the KP Sharma Oli Cabinet’s agenda. Nepal’s two largest parties—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—took decisive steps to split the country’s aviation body into two entities: service provider and regulator.Since 2007, successive governments have proposed plans to end the regulator’s dual role. However, the bills have been languishing in obscurity, although they are vital to ensuring safe aviation in Nepal.Passing the civil aviation bills would establish an independent regulator and remove Nepal from the European Commission’s air safety list, which has caused immense damage to Nepal’s tourism and put a spotlight on the country’s terrible aviation safety record. In December 2013, the European Commission banned all Nepali airlines from flying into the 28-nation bloc.On October 21, addressing an international workshop on ‘EU-South Asia Aviation Partnership Project II Strengthening the partnership in aviation between the EU and South Asia’ held in Kathmandu, EU ambassador to Nepal Veronique Lorenzo said: “If the law is passed to split the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal into a service provider and a regulatory body, the ban imposed on European skies 11 years ago can be removed.”Tourism Minister Badri Prasad Pandey tabled the bills at the Cabinet on September 6 after the law and finance ministries approved their drafts.When a bill is presented, the Cabinet approves the draft legislation and its introduction to Parliament.Nepal has a terrible aviation safety record—eight crashes—six fatal ones—taking place over the past two and a half years, killing over 100 people.Lawmakers have raised concerns about the government’s delay in implementing the new law, which aims to establish an independent civil aviation regulator. The two long-pending aviation bills—the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal Bill and the Air Service Authority of Nepal Bill—propose splitting Nepal’s aviation body into two entities, a condition for Nepal to be struck off the European Commission’s air safety list.Tourism ministry officials say this is the fourth time they have sent the bills to the Cabinet since they were passed by the upper house in 2021. But every time, the government changes, and the bills return. On July 16, 2023, two months before the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), the European authority for aviation safety, planned a safety audit of Nepal’s aviation system, the tourism ministry sent the draft bills to the Cabinet, seeking its ‘approval in principle’ to table them in Parliament.On August 2, 2021, the upper house unanimously passed the two aviation bills, which had been languishing for a year and a half as political squabbling engulfed the country. They were registered on February 23, 2020.The 15th Joint Commission meeting of the European Union held in Kathmandu on March 19 this year underlined that air safety remains a key priority in their bilateral relations.In 2022, in its final audit report, the United Nations aviation watchdog ICAO formally asked Nepal to split the civil aviation body into two entities.Several aviation watchdogs, experts, and diplomatic agencies have urged Nepal to strengthen its independent regulatory body to ensure safer skies.The government first announced the proposal in its Three Year Interim Plan (2007-08 to 2009-10), which stated, “In the context of the completion of the study on the institutional strengthening of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN), which has been working as the service provider in civil aviation, airport operator and regulator; implementation of doable recommendations suggested by the report is being considered.”Since then, every periodic plan and policy, including the annual budget, has prioritised separating the civil aviation body. But the plan has yet to be implemented. \nA Nepali payment system operator says that if all goes well, Nepalis will be able to scan and pay in India from the beginning of 2025.The process from Nepal’s side has been completed, and the operator is waiting for the Indian authority's nod to begin the system, which is expected to become a game changer in cross-border digital transactions.“We have completed all preparations from the network side. India is making some changes to its payment system. So unless India provides the green signal, we cannot start,” said Paras Kunwar, chief operating officer of Fonepay.In September last year, Fonepay Payment Service Ltd, Nepal’s largest payment network and NPCI International Payments Ltd (NIPL), the international arm of the National Payments Corporation of India, agreed to launch the first QR code-based payment solution between Nepal and India.This historic unveiling occurred at the Global Fintech Fest 2023, a global gathering of fintech visionaries, thought leaders and innovators.“India’s NPCI International Payments has given a timeline till December-end to complete the process on their side,” said Kunwar. NPCI is working on anti-money laundering checks and charges, among others.The central bank allowed Nepali payment system operators to process digital retail payments in any country for purchasing goods and services through person-to-merchant (P2M) on June 27.However, no Nepali operator has shown an interest.This provision allows the Nepali payment system operator to agree with any PSO in any country to launch the quick response (QR) code payment system for the citizens of both countries to make purchases.As Nepal Rastra Bank has imposed rules and regulations for banks to set a daily transaction limit of IRs100,000 while making QR code payments in India, some banks have implemented the limit while others are still in the process, said Kunwar. The banks that complete the limitation process can start transactions once the QR payment operation starts.Kunwar said that in addition to India, Fonepay has reached an agreement phase with Chinese payment apps like Alipay+ and UnionPay for QR code payment.“To complete the agreement, getting approval from Nepal Rastra Bank and completing technical integration might take six months, optimistically, for Chinese nationals to make QR code payments in Nepal,” said Kunwar.In the first phase, Chinese nationals will be allowed to make QR code payments in Nepal. In the second phase, Nepalis will be allowed to make QR code payments in China.“It might take time for Nepalis to scan and pay in China,” Kunwar said.On March 1, Indians in Nepal were allowed to make payments through their mobile phones.The QR code system has become a boon for tourists, especially those from India.It has reduced the hassle of carrying cash as the Nepal government has banned all Indian notes above the denomination of 100.According to Fonepay officials, with the Fonepay service available in Muktinath and trekking areas connected to Pokhara, Indian tourists are increasingly scanning and paying.The value of transactions made by Indian nationals in Nepal through QR code payment has grown and typically increases during the weekends.Indians are making Rs6 million in transactions daily, on average, through QR code payments. “On weekends, it increases to Rs8 million daily,” said Kunwar.In addition to neighbouring countries, Fonepay said it is in the agreement phase for QR code payment with South Korea, Singapore, Thailand, and other Southeast Asian nations where tourism flows are high.According to the central bank report, QR code payments increased to Rs61.39 billion in mid-August to mid-September this year from Rs36.21 billion in the same month last year.The number of transactions also increased to 21.57 million from 11.79 million during the review period.Over the past decade, Nepal has witnessed a surge in digital adoption. According to the central bank report, the 4G/LTE services now cover 739 of 753 local units across 77 districts in Nepal.The smartphone penetration rate is 72.94 percent, and 38 percent of households have access to Internet services.The cost of connectivity has also dropped significantly from $2.25 per gigabyte in 2019 to $0.46 per gigabyte in 2023.Thus, as digital technologies become accessible and more affordable, the digital divide, especially the rural and gender divide, is narrowing.The central bank report said that opportunities still exist for digital innovators, as 50 percent of adults from rural areas and 40 percent from urban areas still lack an account at a financial institution.Nepal has experienced many innovations, especially in the digital payments sector, after the Covid-19 pandemic.New payment instruments have evolved, changing the way people transact and bank. Such instruments are Quick Response (QR) codes, connectIPS (Instant Payment System), Cardless Withdrawal, Smart Point-of-Sale (POS), Contactless Cards based on Near-Field Communication (NFC) technology, Virtual Cards, and Digital Lending.Nepal has further operationalised the Retail Payment Switch (RPS) to settle retail payment transactions within the nation, and the development of the National Payment Switch (NPS) is in progress. \nLarge cardamom prices have reached near-record levels, reaching Rs2,500 per kg in Monday’s trading.The price of large cardamom reached a record high of Rs2,700 in 2014 but dropped to Rs850 in 2018, a dip of about 68 percent. The price again broke records in 2016, reaching an all-time high of Rs3,000 per kg. Prices then began to decline steadily, sinking to a low of Rs700 per kg in mid-July 2022.Birtamod in Jhapa is the main trading hub for large or black cardamom, one of the world's most expensive spices. Traders say that demand for the upcoming Ramadan, observed by Muslims worldwide, has been growing, which may trigger a fresh record in the coming days. “As production has dropped in the major producing countries, demand has grown exuberantly in the global market,” said Nirmal Bhattarai, president of the Federation of Large Cardamom Exporters, Nepal. “We expect that large cardamom will hit a new record soon.”Nepal is the largest producer of large cardamom, accounting for 68 percent of the global production, followed by India and Bhutan.The spice is grown in Sikkim, Darjeeling and Bhutan. Large cardamom was introduced in Ilam from Sikkim in 1865.The major cardamom-producing districts in Nepal include Ilam, Panchthar, Taplejung, Sankhuwasabha, Tehrathum, Bhojpur, and Dhankuta.October- November is the peak harvest season.“We expect production could drop by 25 percent in Nepal due to climate change-induced disease,” said Bhattarai. “The disease has affected old and new saplings of large cardamom in the last two years,” he said.“Large cardamom growers cleared their stock last year as the price reached Rs2,150 per kg in the domestic market due to the fall in production. With no stock remaining and production sharply down, demand for the spice could push prices above Rs3,000 per kg in the local market,” said Bhattarai.India is the biggest buyer of Nepal’s large cardamom, absorbing 99 percent of its exports. The spice is re-exported to Pakistan and the Middle East, where it fetches high prices because of local preference for Nepali products.Pakistan is the largest importer of large cardamom, purchasing roughly 60 percent of India’s large cardamom exports. The local Muslim community uses large cardamom pods in biryani, a popular Pakistani dish, as a symbol of prosperity and wealth. Large cardamom has three types depending on quality.The ‘jumbo jet’ is the largest and it is being traded at Rs2,500 per kg. The standard variety is being traded at Rs2,450 per kg, and the third, normal variety is trading at Rs2,375 per kg. The large cardamom grown in Nepal, known as Alaichi, is one of the country’s largest export crops. It is a high-value cash crop and a key income source for farmers in eastern Nepal's mountains and hills.According to the Department of Customs, Nepal exported 5,367 tonnes of large cardamom worth Rs4.81 billion in 2021-22. Export jumped sharply to 9,990 tonnes worth Rs8.27 billion in 2022-23.The customs record shows exports dropped by 50 percent to 5,018 tonnes in the last fiscal year, 2023-24. In value, exports amounted to Rs7.94 billion. According to the Agriculture Ministry statistics, Nepal produced 9,545 tonnes of large cardamom in 2019-20. Output dropped to 8,289 tonnes in 2020-21. In 2021-22, production rose slightly to 8,714 tonnes and over 10,000 tonnes in 2022-23.Farmers are expanding the large cardamom acreage beyond the eastern hill districts. The spice is also being grown in Dadeldhura and Lamjung.Large cardamom is grown on 18,000 hectares in Nepal. Domestic consumption of large cardamom, however, is minimal.Nepali traders were also making efforts to export large cardamom to Bangladesh directly through the Kakarbhitta-Panitanki-Phulbari route as demand has increased there, traders said.The 44-km route provides the shortest access to the Bangladeshi border point of Banglabandha for Nepal's trade with and through Bangladesh.Nepali large cardamom or black cardamom has a distinct flavour profile due to a specific method of postharvest drying in bhattis (ovens), which explains the roasted smell and taste.The smoky flavour would overwhelm a sweet cake or pudding, but in a spice rub for roasted meat or a full-flavoured stew, it imparts a smouldering depth no other spice can, according to experts.In February 2021, the process of identifying and registering five species of large cardamom indigenous to Nepal formally began, paving the way for claiming ownership rights and patenting them internationally. \nThere are certain phrases that Wachuka Gichohi finds difficult to hear after enduring four years of living with long COVID, marked by debilitating fatigue, pain, panic attacks and other symptoms so severe she feared she would die overnight.Among them are normally innocuous statements such as, “Feel better soon” or “Wishing you a quick recovery,” the Kenyan businesswoman said, shaking her head.Gichohi, 41, knows such phrases are well-intentioned. “I think you have to accept, for me, it’s not going to happen.”Recent scientific studies shed new light on the experience of millions of patients like Gichohi. They suggest the longer someone is sick, the lower their chances of making a full recovery.The best window for recovery is in the first six months after getting COVID-19, with better odds for people whose initial illness was less severe, as well as those who are vaccinated, researchers in the United Kingdom and the United States found. People whose symptoms last between six months and two years are less likely to fully recover.For patients who have been struggling for more than two years, the chance of a full recovery “is going to be very slim,” said Manoj Sivan, a professor of rehabilitation medicine at the University of Leeds and one of the authors of the findings published in The Lancet.Sivan said this should be termed “persistent long COVID” and understood like the chronic conditions myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, or fibromyalgia, which can be features of long COVID or risk factors for it.In a study, run by the UK's Office for National Statistics, two million people self-reported long COVID symptoms this past March. Roughly 700,000, or 30.6%, said they first experienced symptoms at least three years previously.Globally, accepted estimates have suggested between 65 million, and 200 million, people have long COVID. That could mean between 19.5 million and 60 million people face years of impairment based on the initial estimates, Sivan said.The United States and some countries like Germany continue to fund long COVID research.But more than two dozen experts, patient advocates and pharmaceutical executives told Reuters that money and attention for the condition is dwindling in other wealthy countries that traditionally fund large-scale studies. In low- and middle-income countries, it was never there.“The attention has shifted,” said Amitava Banerjee, a professor at University College London who co-leads a large trial of repurposed drugs and rehabilitation programmes.He says long COVID should be viewed as a chronic condition that can be treated to improve patients’ lives rather than cured, like heart disease or arthritis.‘PROFOUNDLY DISABLING’Leticia Soares, 39, from northeast Brazil, was infected in 2020 and has battled intense fatigue and chronic pain ever since. On a good day, she spends five hours out of bed.When she can work, Soares is a co-lead and researcher at Patient-Led Research Collaborative, an advocacy group involved in a review, of long COVID evidence published recently in Nature.Soares said she believes recovery seldom happens beyond 12 months. Some patients may find their symptoms abate, only to recur, a kind of remission that can be mistaken for recovery, she said.“It’s so profoundly disabling and isolating. You spend every time wondering, ‘Am I going to get worse after this?’” she said of her own experience.Soares takes antihistamines and other commonly available treatments to cope with daily life. Four long COVID specialist doctors in different countries said they prescribe such medicines, which are known to be safe. Some evidence suggests they help.Others have less success with mainstream medicine.Gichohi's illness was dismissed by her doctor, and she turned to a functional medicine practitioner, who focused on more holistic treatments.She moved out of her hectic home city of Nairobi to a small town near Mount Kenya, policing her activity levels to prevent fatigue and receiving acupuncture and trauma therapy.She has tried the addiction treatment naltrexone, which has some evidence of benefit for long COVID symptoms, and the controversial anti-parasitic infection drug ivermectin, which does not but she says helped her.She said shifting from “chasing recovery” to living in her new reality was important.A piecemeal treatment approach is to be expected while research progresses, and perhaps longer-term, said Anita Jain, a long COVID specialist at the World Health Organization.Meanwhile, long-haulers face a new challenge with each spike in COVID cases. A handful of studies have suggested re-infection can exacerbate existing long COVID.Shannon Turner, a 39-year-old cabaret singer from Philadelphia, got COVID in late March or early April of 2020.She was already living with psoriatic arthritis and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, autoimmune diseases for which she regularly took steroids and an immunotherapy. Such conditions may increase the risk of developing long COVID, researchers say.This past summer, Turner got COVID again. Once again, she is extraordinarily tired and uses a walker for mobility.Turner is determined to pursue her music career despite ongoing pain, dizziness and a racing heart rate, which regularly land her in hospital.“I don’t want to live my life in bed,” she said. \nA 57-year-old man from Dhading district arrived at the outpatient department of Bir Hospital on Wednesday for treatment of a burning sensation of cramps in his legs and feet. Though the patient was unaware of his diabetic problem, tests showed dangerously high blood glucose levels—fasting blood glucose 270, post-meal 340, and HBA1C level 10.7.Doctors say a healthy person's fasting blood glucose level should be less than 100 mg/dl, post-meal blood sugar level below 140 mg/dl, and HBA1c level below 5.7 percent. “We have to carry out multiple tests to know if the high blood glucose has affected the vital organs—kidney, eyes, blood vessels and others,” said Dr Dipak Malla, assistant professor at the National Academy of Medical Sciences. “These types of patients, from remote villages, who have been suffering from high blood pressure but are unaware of it, often visit our hospital.”Diabetes, a chronic disease, occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin (a hormone that regulates blood glucose) or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. The problem has been emerging as a major public health problem in Nepal. A study carried out in 2020 shows that 8.5 percent of the population, or two million people, have been suffering from diabetic problems. The alarming rise in diabetic patients is a global problem, but in low and middle-income countries like Nepal, the disease has drastically increased, with 450 million adults aged 30 and over with diabetes globally (59 percent) who did not receive treatment in 2022, according to a new report.The report titled “Over 800 million adults living with diabetes, more than half not receiving treatment, global study suggests”, which appeared in The Lancet, a leading international medical journal, on Wednesday, showed that the global rate of diabetes (type 1 and 2 combined) in adults doubled from approximately 7 percent to about 14 percent between 1990 and 2022, with the largest increase in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).Of the 828 million adults with diabetes in 2022, over a quarter (212 million) lived in India with another 148 million in China, followed by the USA (42 million), Pakistan (36 million), Indonesia (25 million) and Brazil (22 million).People living in North America, Australasia, central and Western Europe, andparts of Latin America and East Asia, and the Pacific saw a significant improvement in treatment rates for diabetes from 1990 to 2022, contributing to widening global inequities in diabetes treatment.“Our study highlights widening global inequalities in diabetes, with treatment rates stagnating in many low- and middle-income countries where numbers of adults with diabetes are drastically increasing,” said professor Majid Ezzati, of Imperial College London, a senior author of the report.“This is especially concerning as people with diabetes tend to be younger in low-income countries and, in the absence of effective treatment, are at risk of life-long complications—including amputation, heart disease, kidney damage or vision loss—or in some cases, premature death.”Obesity and poor diet are important drivers of the rise in type 2 diabetes rates and their variation across countries. Diabetes rates were either already high or increased more in some of the regions where obesity was or became prevalent between 1990 and 2022. This was compared to many high-income countries, especially those in the Pacific and western Europe, where, in general, obesity and diabetes rates did not rise or rose by a relatively small amount.The study highlights the urgent need for financing of medicines and comprehensive diabetes programmes that enable early detection and effective treatment of diabetes in LMICs.Experts and endocrinologists in Nepal also said that diabetes problems could be far more than what is estimated. What concerns them much is that even young people suffer from high blood sugar.“Young people in their mid 20’s and early 30’s are also suffering from diabetic problems,” said Dr Jyoti Bhattarai Kunwar, a senior endocrinologist. “Many patients do not have easy access to proper treatment. When patients do not get access to proper treatment, problems will not be diagnosed on time. Detection of diabetes must be an urgent priority.”Doctors say that patients could suffer from major health problems—blindness, kidney failure, heart attack, stroke, multi-organ failure, and lower limb amputations if left with high blood sugar. One could think that diabetes is like any other health problem, but serious health problems start when one suffers from high blood glucose.“The number of patients suffering from high blood glucose has been raised alarmingly of late,” said Dr Ansu Mali Joshi, a senior endocrinologist. “A sedentary lifestyle, changing eating habits, and junk foods have been fuelling the problems. A healthy diet, regular exercise, and stress-free life must be promoted to reduce the problems.” \nAs some over-the-counter drugs are suspected of being abused by young people and others, the Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry has compiled a draft plan to revise the rules on how the medications are displayed.Amid deepening concerns on health problems caused by drug abuse, and as a measure to prevent people from overdosing, the ministry aims to revise the law concerning pharmaceuticals and medical devices by the end of next year.Of the over-the-counter drugs, which are medications that can be purchased without a prescription, about 1,500 products that contain six types of substances that could be abused would be subject to the new rules.According to the draft plan, such drugs will be displayed in areas not readily accessible to customers or that are easily visible to pharmacists. As there are currently no strict regulations on where such drugs can be displayed, the new rules are intended to make sure pharmacists or store clerks give an explanation to customers on how to use the drugs.In addition, those under 20 years old would only be allowed to purchase a single small-portion size of the product, and pharmacists or store clerks would be required to check the customer’s identification. Pharmacists or store clerks would also be required to check the identification of someone aged 20 or older if the customer wants to purchase multiple products that can be abused or a large-portion product.For measures regarding customers who repeatedly buy such products, pharmacies and drugstores would be asked to keep records on them and have such information be shared among the employees. Pharmacies and drugstores would also be encouraged to ask specific questions regarding the use of such drugs to those customers.According to the ministry’s survey in fiscal 2023, 20% of pharmacies and drugstores nationwide did not confirm the reason for the purchase when customers bought two or more drugs that can be abused, a step required by law. Observers are urging authorities to tighten control to prevent drug abuse.-In Association with ANN \nThe Dr. Om Foundation conducted a successful free heart camp in Dhamaura village, Mahottari district, on Saturday, offering essential healthcare services to over 600 local residents.The event, organised on the second anniversary of the late Tej Narayan Singh, a prominent public figure, provided ECG screenings, blood pressure checks, and complimentary medications to address critical health needs within the community.Originally scheduled for three days, the camp was extended due to an overwhelming turnout. Dr. Om Murti Anil, founder of the Dr. Om Foundation, expressed concern over a rise in high blood sugar cases, notably among women in their 40s and 50s, many of whom led healthy lifestyles and had no family history of diabetes. To support those in need, the foundation offered a one-month supply of free medicines and urged patients to continue their treatment.The camp also commemorated Singh’s contributions as a social worker, agriculturist, and founder of Dhamaura Higher Secondary School. On the second anniversary of his passing, Dr. Anil and his family donated Rs 511,111 to Shree Janata Rashtriya Secondary School, established by Singh in 1970. Local educators Manoj Yadav and principal Yogendra Yadav highlighted Singh's role in expanding educational access in the area, while former principal Sushil Kumar Yadav commended his dedication to improving educational standards.Reflecting on his father's legacy, Dr. Anil shared personal insights at a memorial event held at Dhamaura Higher Secondary School, noting how Singh’s values inspired him to stay connected to the community and continue his father’s work.The camp and tributes provided a meaningful platform to honour Singh’s enduring legacy in education, healthcare, and community development in Mahottari. \nDusit Princess Kathmandu is organising a five-day trout festival at its SOI restaurant. The dishes will be available for order from 12:30 pm to 10:00 pm every day till August 30. In celebration of Nepal’s rivers and lakes, which provide an ideal environment for high-quality trout, the Director of Culinary Food and Beverage Service, Chef Utpal Mondal, and his team at Dusit Princess Kathmandu have crafted a menu showcasing the flavours and versatility of locally sourced trout. “As the festive month of Shrawan ends, people focus on healthy and nutritious food. Trout, rich in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and essential minerals, offers a heart-friendly option that checks all the boxes from a nutritional and culinary standpoint,” says Mondal.He adds that the goal of the culinary event is to offer their guests a rare opportunity to experience a wide variety of trout dishes they wouldn’t typically find at home.The event menu features twelve unique dishes, six of which are drawn from diverse culinary traditions across continents. Three dishes are inspired by oriental cuisine, while the remaining three highlight flavours from Nepal and India. The menu has been designed to include various dishes, from soups and starters to main courses, including Mexican, Italian, Continental, and Thai flavours.While discussing the event’s highlights, Mondal said, “The celebration presents a unique opportunity for guests to indulge in a diverse range of trout-based dishes, something they wouldn’t typically have the chance to experience elsewhere.” \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nA stunning bicycle kick from Antonio Sanabria and a second-half header from Omar Alderete gave Paraguay a well earned 2-1 home win over Argentina in the South American World Cup qualifiers on Thursday.Argentina took the lead 11 minutes into the game when Enzo Fernandez’s deep pass found Lautaro Martinez, whose thunderous shot was initially ruled out for offside, but was eventually awarded after a VAR review.Paraguay went close moments later when Gustavo Gomez’s header from a corner hit the crossbar. The home side quickly tried again with Gustavo Velazquez’s cross finding Sanabria, who unleashed a superb overhead kick that left goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez helpless.The shocked visitors struggled to find their feet, with captain Lionel Messi largely absent from the action for much of the first half and only managing one shot that went wide.However, he was twice fouled by Alderete, but referee Anderson Daroco didn't show him a second yellow card before the break.Two minutes into the second half, Paraguay defender Alderete headed in from a free kick following a foul by substitute Leonardo Balerdi on Julio Enciso.Rodrigo de Paul had the best chance to equalise 20 minutes before the end but he failed to control the ball after a breakaway and his shot went wide as Argentina’s errors continued to mount with Paraguay holding firm in defence.“I think, overall, we played a great game. We controlled the ball. Their goals came from two of our mistakes. We need to fix our lapses on set pieces,” striker Martinez said after the match to TyC sports.“{The (goal) at the start of the second half made everything more difficult. We have to congratulate the opponent, who defended very well,” Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni told a press conference.World Cup holders Argentina top the standings with 22 points from 11 games and will host ninth-placed Peru on Tuesday.Paraguay are sixth on 16 points, behind on goal difference to Ecuador, who hammered Bolivia 4-0 on Thursday, and Uruguay, who host second-placed Colombia on Friday.Earlier, Brazil were held to a 1-1 draw by Venezuela , leaving them in third place on 17 points.The top six teams will qualify automatically for the 2026 World Cup hosted by the United States, Mexico and Canada. \nBrazil had to settle for a 1-1 draw at Venezuela after a quick-fire second-half strike by substitute Telasco Segovia canceled out Raphinha’s opener for the dominant visitors in the South American World Cup qualifiers on Thursday.Vinicius Jr missed a chance to win the game with a penalty against a Venezuelan side who played the last minutes of the game down to 10-man after substitute Alexander Gonzalez was sent off for hitting both Gabriel Martinelli and Vinicius in the face in successive plays in the 89th minute.Five-time World Cup champions Brazil are third in the standings on 17 points, five from leaders Argentina, while Venezuela are seventh on 12 points. The top six sides are guaranteed a berth at the 2026 finals.The high-paced match saw numerous chances from both sides who registered 11 goal attempts each, with Brazil enjoying over 60% of possession but failing to turn their dominance into goals and getting often exposed to counter attacks.Off the back of successive wins against Peru and Chile, Brazil were dangerous from the start with Vinicius a constant menace, hitting the post in the 20th minute.Raphinha gave Brazil the lead, netting a fine left-footed strike from a free kick on the edge of the box in the 43rd minute that ricocheted off the left post before finding the back of the net.It was Brazil’s first goal from a free kick in over 19 years in World Cup qualifiers after former Real Madrid fullback Roberto Carlos scored also against Venezuela in 2005.But Segovia stroke an unstoppable first-effort shot from the edge of the box 38 seconds into the second half to level the game assisted by Jefferson Savarino.But Brazil kept threatening and had an opportunity to get back in front in the 62nd minute when Vinicius was fouled inside the box by goalkeeper Rafael Romo in a counter attack.However, Romo stopped Vinicius' poorly taken spot kick and the Real Madrid striker also failed to net the rebound, missing wide left of the empty goal and Venezuela held on against Brazil's late press for a winner.“It is just sad because, for me, the most important thing is to win and I think we could have won the match,” Raphinha told Brazilian TV Globo.“We knew it was going to be complicated, their team also has good qualities, but sometimes things get complicated by what happens in the match, when you fail to score the chances you have. We have to keep working to get back to winning ways.” \nHolders Ivory Coast and Equatorial Guinea became the latest countries to qualify for next year’s Africa Cup of Nations finals but did not have to kick a ball to do so, as the penultimate round of qualifiers began on Wednesday.The Ivorians, winners at the last finals which they hosted at the start of the year, are certain of finishing in the top two places in Group G after Sierra Leone were held to a 1-1 draw by Chad in Abidjan.The Ivorians sit on nine points from four matches, with Zambia second in the group on seven from four. Sierra Leone have five points with one game to play and Chad are eliminated.Chad moved the clash to the Ivory Coast because they are one of 18 countries barred from hosting international matches because of the poor state of their stadia.They went a goal behind to Abu-Diaby Dumbuya’s stunning 29th-minute effort but equalised with a Panenka-style penalty from defender Mahamat Thiam five minutes later.A 1-0 win for Liberia over Togo in Monrovia in Group E eliminated both countries and guaranteed Equatorial Guinea progress to the tournament in Morocco, which is to be played from Dec. 21, 2025 to Jan. 18, 2026. The top two sides in each of the 12 qualifying groups advance to the finals.Equatorial Guinea, who were a surprise package at the last finals, sit on seven points from their four matches, while Liberia who have four points from five games and Togo have two.Even if Liberia finish with same points tally as Equatorial Guinea, who host group leaders Algeria on Thursday, they cannot overhaul them in the standings because of the head-to-head record between the two.Equatorial Guinea beat Liberia home and away last month, but on Wednesday substitute Mohammed Sangare, who came through the ranks at Newcastle United but now plays his club football in Switzerland, tucked away an 83rd-minute penalty to ensure Liberia’s first win of the group.MAIDEN VICTORYIt was also a maiden victory for caretaker coach Thomas Kojo, drafted in last month after Romanian Mario Marinica was fired.Earlier on Wednesday, Cameroon hung on for a goalless draw away against Namibia in their Group J clash played in Johannesburg, South AfricaNamibia came close to snatching victory midway through the second half when diminutive forward Prins Tjiueza hit the upright with a header and then slammed the rebound onto the same post as Andre Onana kept a clean sheet for a fourth time in five matches in the qualifiers.Cameroon had already qualified from Group J while it was the first point of the campaign for the already-eliminated Namibia.Afterwards, Cameroon coach Marc Brys bemoaned the poor organisation which saw his side arrive less than 24 hours before kick-off and have to do without Brentford striker Bryan Mbeumo and Brighton & Hove Albion’s Carlos Baleba, who did not make it to the game on the time after playing in the Premier League at the weekend.Algeria, Equatorial Guinea, the Ivory Coast and Cameroon are joined by Angola, Burkina Faso, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt, Morocco and Senegal in the finals.More places should be decided on Thursday when a further nine qualifiers are played around the continent, with the likes of Nigeria, Sudan and Tunisia looking likely to book their tickets to Morocco. \nMilitary cooperation between Russia and North Korea amid Russia’s aggression in Ukraine is feared to have a serious impact on security conditions in East Asia, including Japan.There is a possibility that North Korea will learn techniques of modern-day warfare and Russia could provide technologies related to nuclear weapons and missiles to the country.The North Korean troops who have entered Russia are believed to be elite soldiers of special operation units. It is assumed that they will engage in urban warfare in Seoul or other large cities should a military contingency occur in the Koran Peninsula.According to South Korea’s National Intelligence Service, the North Korean troops are now learning how to control unmanned aircraft in Russia, among other things.South Korea and North Korea are only in a truce. Thus, South Korea is wary that the North’s troop deployment to Russia may help strengthen North Korea’s military capabilities.South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol openly expressed his sense of urgency at a press conference on Nov. 7 saying, “If the North Korean military acquires modern-day warfare experience, it will be a deadly problem for South Korea’s security.”If a military contingency occurs in the Korean Peninsula, Pyongyang expects Russia to become involved based on a recently ratified treaty between the two countries.It seems that Pyongyang also expects Russia, as a nuclear superpower, will provide its technologies related to nuclear weapons and missiles in exchange for North Korea’s provision of weapons and military deployment.Such an improvement of North Korea’s technological capabilities will be a serious threat to Japan and South Korea.On the other hand, China, which has backed Pyongyang, has taken a wait-and-see attitude regarding the “bilateral relationship” of Russia and North Korea as the two grow closer.But diplomatic sources in Beijing share the view that Chinese President Xi Jinping’s administration does not regard the ties favorably and views the relationship as one that could raise tensions in the Korean Peninsula.China has placed importance on North Korea’s role as “a buffer zone” against U.S. forces in South Korea and the South Korean military.Chinese military officials and other experts have expressed concern that the current situation may make “peace and stability” in the Korean Peninsula collapse, the sources added.Some in the international community are demanding that China exercise its influence on Pyongyang so that North Korea does not join Russia’s aggression.However, it is expected that Beijing will not take any substantial action since doing so may cause North Korea to lean further toward Russia.-In Association with ANN \nChaaaiiittt…The spontaneous eruption of the sound of victory thundered through the neighbourhood of Nhyokha in the Kathmandu core. The line of a kite cut another. Looking out the window of her house, Sajani Shrestha saw children running full speed, shouting and fighting as they vied to catch the falling kite and thread. And craning her neck up to the sky, she could not count but only be mesmerised by the innumerable kites strewn across the skies of Nhyokha, Bangemudha, Indrachowk. “There would be so many kites that they entirely covered the blue of the sky, making beautiful patterns of different colours,” says the 51-year-old. “And you cannot imagine the number of times the call of chait rang in the air.”Clear blue sky and gentle westerlies, the season of kites has arrived in the Kathmandu Valley. While kites soared Kathmandu's sky mainly during Dashain, the kite season officially started in Nag Panchami (August) and ended on the Haribodhini Ekadashi (November). And from royalities to commoners, young and old all flew kites from rooftops and open grounds. Even those who did not, like Sajani, revelled in the live spectacle in the sky as kites soared and fought. With Bhimsen Thapa’s help, King Girvanyuddha flies kites The earliest written account of kite flying is believed to date to 200 BC in China. In Kathmandu, this tradition has religious and socio-cultural and environmental significance, says Tina Manandhar, lecturer of Nepalese History, Culture and Archaeology at Tribhuvan University. According to her, it is believed that kites in Kathmandu skies carry a message to the god of rain Indra that the valley's farmers have had enough rain for their crops. That is why Kathmandu farmers scolded anyone flying kites before plantation season.In an article ‘Changako Utpati Ra Bikas’ published in Gorkhapatra in 1995, historian Rajesh Gautam points to the lack of written documents indicating the exact time when kite culture was introduced in Nepal. Exploring different opinions on kite's introduction to Nepal, he writes that “some have opined the possibility that the skill and tradition of kite flying might have entered Nepal through India.” Yet some others, he writes, state that kites “came to Nepal from Japan during the time of [Rana PM] Dev Shumsher.”He concludes that most likely this tradition was introduced by Malla-era Newar traders: “But since Nepal’s relationship with Tibet and China is very old and direct, kites might have entered Nepal through the Newar traders who were engaged in the trade. One can estimate that the kite was introduced to Nepal during the (mediaeval) Malla regime.”In Social History of Nepal, TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi write that there exists documented evidence of the kite flying from the early 19th century. The authors state that Sundarananda, a contemporary poet, has mentioned that the young king Girvanyuddha Bikram Shah (r.1799-1816), with the help of Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa, flew kites from the towering temple of Taleju Bhawani, Hanumandhoka. And when the king's kite cut the kites of the youngsters, they were located and rewarded with money.In Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Sardar Bhim Bahadur Pandey states that “During the month of Kartik [October-November] young and old all flew kites,” suggesting that kite culture was ubiquitous in Kathmandu by the early twentieth century.Anticipations and preparationsKite flying in Nepal requires a kite, a lattai (a wooden spool), thread and majha (homemade adhesive prepared by boiling snail slime, rice or sago, and powdered glass from burnt electric bulbs and coated on the line to sharpen it for kite fighting).77-year-old Nirmal Man Tuladhar, an avid kite flyer and retired professor of Linguistics at the Tribhuvan University, explains how Nepali tradition of kite flying was both expensive and needing advance preparation.“In our times, it wasn’t easy to fly kites,” he says. “We had to prepare majha …And as Nepali kites are fighter kites, we mainly fought with other kites [which meant we spent a lot of threads].”This preparation needed first and foremost of passing a hurdle: securing finances and materials to fly kites. While lattai was a one-time investment that could be saved for years, kites and threads had to be replenished every time a kite was cut.“Those were the times when parents wanted us to be more focused in our studies. They only gave money [to buy kites] after immense pestering,” says 80-year-old Dwarika Nath Dhungel, former Secretary of Nepal government, speaking of the 1950s and 1960s.Biodiversity specialist and botanist Tirtha Bahadur Shrestha, 86, was born in Mahabouddha and began flying kites from 1951-52. He saved what little money he got for afternoon snacks to buy Hattimar reel, a brand of line wound in a small lattai, which was strong and sharp and where majha stuck well.Raghuji Pant, a member of parliament, also recalls the difficulty in securing money to sustain his kite flying in and around Kathmandu core in the 1960s and early 1970s. “Four to five of my kites were cut in a day,” writes the 67-year-old in his 2019 article “Changa Jastai Udi Hidne Man” published in Himalkhabar. “[This caused] the line in the spool to shorten. From Bhadra [August-September] to one to one and a half months after Dashain I spent flying kites. So, it was difficult for me to have enough kites even after getting money from grandfather, grandmother, mother and everyone.”Kites and thread secured, now began the crucial work of preparing and applying majha whose strength determined how well it cut other kites. Govinda Tandon, 70, a historian and heritage expert, who grew up in Battisputali, was also an ardent kite flyer.“Materials for making majha were prepared right from the morning on a holiday,\" he writes in his article “Dashainko Butte Changa” published in Gorkhapatra. “Because this work couldn’t be accomplished without a collaboration of 3-4 friends, a holiday was set aside for this. Moreover, a sunny day was considered appropriate. If the majha didn’t dry, the thread could turn moist, and so if it felt like the day wouldn’t be sunny, the entire plan…was aborted.”Kite makers, kite sellers and variety of kites One of the oldest shops in Kathmandu's memory, Shree Chitrakar Kite Center in Tyauda, Asan is bustling with customers during Dashain. “When my grandmother got married and came to this house at age 12 [in early 1940s], this shop was already here,” says its fourth generation owner 47-year-old Dinoj Chitrakar. “So the shop must be around a hundred years old.”Another shop that stands out in Kathmandu's memory is Manandhar Kite Center in Kalimati, established in 1949, and currently run by brothers Mohan Man and Sundar Man Manandhar.In his book Antar Taranga, artist and writer Manuj Babu Mishra recalls “a kite shop near the old halwai shop of Chabahil” in the 1940s. Dhungel and his 1960 batchmates of Juddhodaya Public School recall the kite shops from the 1950s and 1960s – Bekhacha’s Shop at Netapacho, Bhaicha’s Shop at Nhyokha, Lata Manandhar’s Shop at Maru, Kanchha Buddha Bajracharya Shop at Tyauda.Besides the shops, there were makers and sellers of kites cloistered in different localities of Kathmandu Valley.In Kwalkhu, Patan was a Joshi who made Nepali paper kites.“One day I accompanied my uncle to buy kites,\" writes Dibya Giri, 69, in his 2023 article “Changa” in Sahitya Post. “I was amazed to see the huge stacks of kites there. We used to call it the house of the kite maker.”In Nhyokha, Purna Bahadur Shrestha began making kites as a teenager and started his own kite business in the 1950s, according to his daughter Sajani.These kites, made out of Nepali paper, often had different paintings. Mishra recalls painting kites for the kite shop in Chabahil.“I went to that kite shop and with the freely available colours and Nepali papers, I spent my day painting faces, birds, animals, masks, mountains, hills, whatever came to my mind,” he writes in the book. “Such kites apparently sold well!”Most septuagenarians and older generations like Tuladhar and Tirtha Bahadur recall flying kites made of Nepali paper when young. Tirtha Bahadur says that kites from Lucknow began coming to Kathmandu only after the late 1950s. But at least a section of Kathmandu was flying kites from Lucknow from the early twentieth century. Vaidya, Manandhar and Joshi write that the Ranas and Shahs imported kites from Lucknow and that from them, their favourite employees also got to fly some. These kites were large and, in Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Pande writes that they were referred to as Lucknowia kites.Known for their characteristic hissing sound they made while flying, light body, swift movement and ability to take sharp turns, Lucknow kites were preferred by kite fighters.“Lucknow kites were lighter and could be manoeuvred well,” says Tuladhar. “Kites of Nepali paper were stable but difficult to manoeuvre. They were also expensive. So only some fighters flew Nepali paper kites.”The kites had different names depending upon their designs and colours – Ambe (a heart in the centre), Dibdibe (chequered), Pakhete (a different coloured paper on one edge), Sete (white-coloured), Nilchi (blue-coloured), Rate (red-coloured) and so on.The kite fighters preferred the strong and sharp Hattimar reel that came on a small lattai. The Belchamar reel was cheaper but weaker and prone to be cut by other threads. Kite fliers and kite watchers on rooftops and open groundsBibek Shrestha, 57, and his two brothers took stacks of kites and climbed their rooftops. The rooftops around theirs in the neighbourhood of Nhyokha – in fact in all core settlements of the Valley – were filled with kite fliers and spectators. Many risked precariously balancing on the sloped roofs.While Bibek and his brothers’ kites alighted to meet the sea of kites in the sky, their sister Sajani and other family members gathered around to revel in the live spectacle.Dhungel remembers the rooftops of Jhochhen and surroundings of the 1950s and 1960s swelled with kite fliers. Dhungel did try to fly kites. But he did not become a successful kite flyer. What he did become was, like Sajani and many Kathmandu residents, an admirer of kites soaring in the sky.“But more than engaging in my unsuccessful kite flying attempts, I enjoyed looking at the kites flying. There would be a big crowd of spectators. Females and other family members watched the kites fly as they ate meat and chiura. Some even drank and rejoiced as they flew kites.”When the age of cassette player and speakers dawned in the 1980s, songs blared from the speakers alongside kite flying. Chitrakar and Bibek invited their friends, put their favourite songs on speakers and spent entire afternoons flying kites, dancing, singing and eating.Away from the core cities, in the villages in the Valley, people flew kites in open fields. Like Dibya, who set his kite for flight from the banks of Godavari River in Tikathali. Chhauni was also a popular space for flying kites.Kathmandu’s joy in kite fightingBibek pulled his kite down and then manoeuvred it back up so his line touched his opponent's line from below and quickly reeled out his line. The resulting sharpness from the speed cut the opponent's line.Chaaaiiitttt………“The greatest fun comes from cutting another kite's string,” writes Tuladhar in his 1996 article “Cutting is the greatest fun” published in magazine Kite Lines. “With its coating of adhesive paste and ground glass, the string is as sharp and abrasive as sandpaper on your opponent's line.”Nepali kite, Tuladhar says, is made to fight other kites, and describes how a kite line cuts the other.“The technique is to touch your rival's string and immediately reel out line at high speed,” he writes. “The Nepalese style of kite flying is aggressive, and though the kites look simple, they are strategically designed for bringing down other kites.”At any given time, like Bibek’s kite above Nhyokha sky, skies above the Valley were filled with raging kites, swinging, coming down and going up as the fighters reeled in and out their lattais in ferocious attempts to bring down other kites.Meanwhile spectators cheered. “Even passersby stopped to look at the kites,” recalls Tina.The moment of a kite cutting was accompanied by the sound of chait, and children ran in the direction of the falling kite to grab it and the thread in what was termed as, Dibya says, changa lutne/dhago lutne.Dhungel always joined in to shout the chait resounding through the locality of Jhochhen and almost automatically his feet sped towards the severed kites' direction.“‘Oii leave that thread,’ the kite owner would scold me. ‘Why do you pull my thread, leave it right now.’ But I’d continue pulling the threads as the owner continued shouting. Other times I caught the kites that had failed to fly and dropped on the ground.”The fallen kites got stuck in the buildings, trees or poles, or glided down in the open grounds or paddy fields. Falling kites from the Kathmandu core settled down in Tundikhel covering it. Oftentimes kites fell on the fields to rest upon the lush paddy nearing its harvest.“Children ran straight into the fields to catch the kite,” says Dibya. \"They destroyed the crops by stepping on them. Some farmers chased them, scolding along as they did so and if they caught anyone, they slapped them.”Love and restrictions on kiteAmidst the raging kite fights high up in the sky, there were apparently also some quieter kites lingering much lower among the buildings or tree lines, for their goals lay in not ruthlessly cutting the threads of other kites but piercing softly through the hearts of their owners' love interests. During the Rana regime, there were designated public spaces to fly kites, writes Gautam in his article. Referring to oral accounts, he writes that the Ranas were particularly careful to avoid kite flyers around their durbars. This is because love-stricken men tied letters to kites and flew them into the durbars to their love interests among the nanis.He writes that the kites could be flown mainly on the grounds of Chhauni. Anyone flying kites in any other place and around Rana durbars were arrested.Pant also recalls love-stricken boys from his time. “Just as kites came in different colours and patterns, so did kite flyers,” he writes in the article. “Some wrote love letters using a few words in “symbolic language” on a plain kite and attempted to land it on the rooftop of the girl they liked. Some simply landed their kites on any rooftop if a girl appeared there and waited for reaction.”King Tribhuvan among kite fliersPande writes in his book: “Once or twice during kite season every year, King Tribhuvan went to Chhauni to fly kites. Legend has it that if the line of the king’s kite was cut, it flew to Lhasa. But since anyone who caught that kite received five rupees, everyone attempted to catch that kite.”In 2021 news report ‘Bhawanle Chhekidiyo Changa Udaune Aakash’ by Shivahari Ghimire published in Nayapatrika, cultural expert the late Satyamohan Joshi also recounts that “During Dashain, Tribhuvan came to the ground below Swayambhu to fly kites. […] He did not use the same thread to fly kites twice.”In the same article, Joshi says that the King also went to Budhanilakantha to fly kites and participate in kite flying competitions.End of season, end of cultureMohan Krishna Shrestha, 86, was born in Budhanilakantha. Every year, on the day of Haribodhini Ekadashi, he saw the annual fair at the Budhanilakantha Temple. He also witnessed kite fliers gathered in the open fields around the Temple.“Oh, it’d be a lot of people,” says Shrestha. “They came from all around Bhaktapur, Kathmandu and Lalitpur.”They flew kites on Ekadashi, Dwadashi and some even until Purnima.“They took all the remaining threads and kites that had survived Dashain and flew the last kites of the season,” says Tuladhar. “I remember my uncles, relatives and neighbours going to Budhanilakantha with their kites.”Joshi recalls in the 2021 article that King Tribhuvan also went to Budhanilakantha with his sons Mahendra, Himalaya and Basundhara. He greatly supported and also participated in the competitions there organised by the commoners. If he liked he gave prize money to the winners.This annual event lost its glory days after the decline in the open fields as buildings began to rise with the establishment of Budhanilkantha School in 1972, Mohan says.“The event survived in some form until the 1990s,” he says.But what happened after that?The end-of-the-season event in the 1990s was also an indication of the end of the age-old kite tradition.“If I go to my ancestral place in Asan to fly kites, it’s not possible for me to do that today because there are buildings everywhere,” says Tuladhar. “Cityscapes and urbanisation have created the obstacle for flying kites.”Dibya does feel like flying kites sometimes.“No space to fly kites today,” he says. “In the old times, there were river banks and open fields. Even if you fly kites, it gets stuck in somebody's rooftop or water tank or somewhere.”Yesteryear’s kite enthusiasts believe that increasing means of entertainment was another reason for the decline of kite culture.“When television came, kite flying started to slowly decrease,” says Bibek. “And then mobile phones robbed kite flying even more.”And so, when his sister Sajani cranes her neck up in the sky today, she rarely sees a kite.“Those days we heard one chait after another,” she says. “These days you won’t hear a single chait.” \nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nWhat animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. \nIn Nepal’s political landscape, the same politicians remain at the centre of power for decades. Take the current Prime Minister, KP Sharma Oli, for example, who exercises near-absolute control within the CPN-UML. Many politicians express frustration with his leadership in private conversations, yet few dare challenge him. Why? Their self-interest—often tied to political appointments, election tickets and funding opportunities—prevents them from questioning his legitimacy.This, however, is not unique to the UML. Maoist Centre’s Pushpa Kamal Dahal has maintained an iron grip on his party for over 35 years, with efforts to unseat him ending the political careers of many challengers. In the Nepali Congress, Sher Bahadur Deuba has centralised support around himself, not necessarily because of his “supreme power,” but the self-interest of those around him. Nepali politicians aren’t motivated by policy or ideological alignment; they are driven by personal benefit, perpetuating a system where individual leaders dominate parties, stifling dissent and competition.Even new parties, such as the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) founded by Rabi Lamichhane, replicate these dynamics. Built around the cult of personality, Lamichhane dominates his party, much like CK Raut in the Janamat Party. Lamichhane’s party is currently protesting against his supposed “politically charged” arrest, even though he has been taken into custody for cooperatives fraud. In Kathmandu, Balen Shah’s rise is based on his public image. He has openly admired leaders like Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and American President Donald Trump and has adopted their political tactics. Such a trend suggests a dangerous pattern in Nepali politics—political power is increasingly concentrated on individuals rather than institutions. The solution lies in cultivating genuine intra-party democracy.The illusion of leadership changeThe idea of \"exit policies\" within parties like the Nepali Congress has generated some debate. Genuine democracy within parties requires more than setting a retirement age or term limits. It necessitates a political culture where leadership exits are probable because of robust internal competition. Hence, an exit policy is hardly the solution to the problem of entrenched leaders. It may push an individual out, but it does not address the broader undemocratic culture that has taken hold within Nepal's major political parties. Exit policies fail to offer a real solution because they do not change the structure or system of power within parties. We need a political culture where leadership transitions are not just probable but a constant possibility.Top leaders must realise that their position is always vulnerable—subject to internal challenges from qualified, competent alternatives. Emerging leaders who can challenge their authority should pressure them. This can be possible only if political parties stop being loyal to only a single leader. The parties must become open spaces, allowing new ideas and fresh leadership to rise. Unfortunately, none of this is currently possible in Nepal. Intra-party democracy—where there is a regular, fair and open process for leadership selection—has largely been absent from our political system.Decaying democracyHow can we expect leaders who suppress internal party democracy to champion democratic principles at the national level? The same leaders who ruthlessly crush internal opposition, cement their rule as the only viable option, and do whatever it takes to maintain power cannot be trusted to safeguard the country’s democratic values. This pattern mirrors authoritarian regimes, where leaders present themselves as the solution to all national problems.Self-interest is at the core of Nepal's political dysfunction. Leaders surround themselves with loyalists who expect political and financial rewards for their allegiance. This dynamic creates a toxic environment where factions form around personal interests rather than ideologies or policies.True democracy cannot thrive when the internal structures of its most vital institutions—political parties—are profoundly undemocratic. Power may shift from a Koirala to a Deuba or a Nepal to an Oli, but this doesn’t signify progress. These represent a reshuffling of elites rather than a fundamental shift in how power is distributed and exercised. Without dismantling the factional politics driven by self-interest, the larger democratic project remains in jeopardy.The path forwardFor democracy to be strengthened, Nepal must look inward—at the parties forming its political system's backbone. This does not necessarily mean ousting long-standing leaders like Oli, Prachanda, or Deuba and replacing one leader with another. What is needed is a transformation in how parties operate internally.Leadership should not be seen as a lifetime appointment. It needs to be accountable not only to the public but also to the very institutions it helms. Only when Nepali political parties embrace intra-party democracy can the broader political system become more democratic. This will require systemic reforms that foster transparency, competition and merit-based advancement within parties. Without these changes, Nepal’s political system will remain a breeding ground for authoritarian tendencies under the guise of democratic leadership.It’s important to recognise that the alternative to a dysfunctional democracy is not radical system change but meaningful reform. Democracy is not just about holding elections or transferring power between individuals. It is a political culture where power is not held by a small clique of people but shared, opposed and renovated.  \nAlgorithms played a vital role in determining the outcome of the 2024 US election. These invisible forces on platforms like X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and TikTok have evolved from tools meant to connect people into powerful influencing forces that determine what people see, believe, and, eventually, how they vote. If we do nothing to curtail their impact, we risk losing the democratic principles that underpin our society.The social media recommendation algorithms that control our social media feeds are designed to keep people engaged, but they have now become extremely sophisticated and play a central role in shaping public discourse. If a post goes viral, the algorithms decide that more people should see it. People are unaware that an invisible force is shaping political conversation and decisions.As the election approached, these algorithms didn’t treat all the content equally. Platforms like X and Facebook seem to reward posts that stir anger, fear, or outrage. Unlike thought-out perspectives, such posts spread like wildfire, leading to heated online public discourse. Algorithms widened the gap in an already divided political climate in the US and made it difficult for people to get authentic and truthful content. However, the influence of AI went beyond algorithms. During the campaign, generative AI tools capable of creating hyper-realistic deepfake content designed to mislead voters flooded social media. Even the fact-checkers could not keep up with the speed of such artificial intelligence techniques. To make matters worse, the social media algorithms implied these viral posts, further confusing the voters. Traditionally, social media posts seemed to favour Democrats; however, as Elon Musk acquired X, the algorithms were made more transparent but also unpredictable. The more right-leaning posts started to receive visibility, sparking concerns about social media platform's role in shaping the political discourse. Worse, Musk’s tweets and retweets were confusing and more right-leaning, and they were amplified by the platform in the country, which has an extremely polarised political atmosphere. This amplification of algorithm-driven partisan content to increase high engagement changed how people voted in elections. Political advertisements, viral posts and fake news stories were tailored to specific groups based on psychological profiles, increasing biases and fears. As a result, it was extremely hard for regular people to have rational, cross-ideological dialogue. Simply put, people were flooded with information and could not make rational decisions. The global reach of social media platforms further complicated things. These platforms aren’t just serving domestic audiences in the United States. Foreign actors are also using them to influence voters. Before the election, US intelligence officials reported that adversaries from Russia and elsewhere had deployed AI-driven tools to manipulate voters in key swing states. Deepfake videos flooded the internet, exploiting the same algorithm designed to amplify viral content, which made disinformation campaigns more effective.There have been efforts to curb misinformation, but the impact has been low. Social media platforms started using AI tools to detect and limit misleading content, but these tools failed to recognise new forms of deception, especially as bad actors were quick to refine their tactics. AI-driven content will only become more sophisticated; distinguishing fact from fiction will become harder.The most troubling part of this new reality is the growing sense of powerlessness it creates. Already overwhelmed by the constant flow of information, voters find themselves at the mercy of algorithms that shape their worldview. The foundation of democratic decision-making erodes when misinformation spreads unchecked. The line between truth and falsehood gets blurred in this new environment, leaving helpless voters to navigate a political landscape that has become more of a maze than a space for rational debates. Fixing this newfound problem of algorithmic manipulation in politics is challenging. Advocates are calling for platforms to disclose how their recommendation systems work and take responsibility for the negative consequences. However, transparency alone might not be enough to tackle this problem. AI is evolving and becoming more complex, which means full transparency could still leave many questions unanswered. Another suggestion is for the government to regulate social media algorithms. But this also comes with significant challenges as it may stifle innovation or inadvertently create political biases, making it harder for people to express their views freely. Striking the right balance between protecting the integrity of public discourse and preserving freedom of speech will be a major challenge in future. Nepal should start thinking along this line. This issue ultimately boils down to voter responsibility. To combat the effects of algorithmic manipulation, people must have good judgment skills regarding the information they consume. Digital literacy, the ability to understand how algorithms work and how they shape what we see, will be crucial for future elections. Voters must know how algorithms influence their perceptions and critically evaluate the information that floods their feeds. As Dr Srinivas Mukkamala, a cybersecurity expert, notes, “The first step to regaining control is understanding the game that is being played.”The 2024 US election was just a reminder of the risks and dangers of the growing influence of algorithms on the political system. Moving forward, the role of social media and AI in shaping democracy will only continue to increase. If we want to preserve the integrity of our elections and ensure that public debate remains grounded in truth, the algorithms that shape our political landscape must be tamed. The question, however, isn’t just who controls these systems but how we, as a society, choose to manage and mitigate their influence for the good of democracy. \nDuring my tenure in the National Assembly, I championed a resolution to protect the rights of provincial and local governments and to ensure the effective implementation of federalism. This resolution addressed 15 critical areas requiring the attention of the Government of Nepal, with the first point urging the activation of intergovernmental relations (IGR) entities, such as the National Coordination Council (NCC) and the Interprovince Council. On June 2, 2022, the Assembly discussed and unanimously endorsed this resolution, instructing the government to take action.According to the Federation, Province and Local Level Coordination and Inter-Relation Act, 2020 (IGR Law), the NCC, chaired by the prime minister, chief ministers and local government representatives, serves as a vital platform for resolving intergovernmental issues. Despite this provision, the NCC had not convened even once since the law’s enactment. The resolution prioritised this, recognising the importance of activating these IGR entities to address federal issues.Following the Assembly’s directive, the then Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal convened the NCC’s first meeting on July 1, 2023. This was a significant development, but the journey had just begun. Following this, the Assembly established a seven-member ‘Federalism Implementation Study and Monitoring Parliamentary Special Committee’. The Committee was tasked with examining all aspects of federalism implementation, including political, fiscal, administrative and structural challenges. In four months, it recommended 99 action points across 11 thematic areas, such as fiscal federalism, administrative federalism, intergovernmental relations and service delivery to strengthen federalism implementation.The first recommendation called for revising the “Unbundling Exercise.” While the Constitution delineates functional responsibilities among federal, provincial and local governments, ambiguities in the initial unbundling exercise have led to overlapping and duplicated responsibilities. After five years of federalism, the committee noted the pressing need to re-evaluate the exercise to clarify responsibilities among all levels of government. Consequently, the committee instructed the Office of the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers (OPMCM) to initiate this task and complete it within six months. Dahal, attending the National Assembly session, assured that he would follow the Committee’s recommendations, including revising the unbundling exercise.Following the repeated pressure from the National Assembly, the NCC’s meeting in July last year marked a turning point as it decided to amend the unbundling exercise. Among the six key decisions, the second was to form a nine-member committee led by the Secretary of Provincial Coordination at the OPMCM to clarify functional responsibilities across government levels. The committee was instructed to complete its work within six months.In addition to this committee, the OPMCM, with approval at the prime minister’s level, created five specialised task forces in the economic, administrative, social, legal and infrastructure sectors. The relevant secretary headed each task force, including sectoral experts and federal ministry representatives. These committees conducted in-depth reviews in their assigned fields. Representatives from the Municipal Association of Nepal and the National Association of Rural Municipalities in Nepal participated and helped organise feedback and consultation programmes across provinces.A significant meeting took place last year in Hetauda, where all seven provincial Chief Ministers and representatives from local government associations gathered to discuss the unbundling exercise. They later submitted their report to the OPMCM for further review. A high-level expert team, including specialists in federalism, administration, law, finance and infrastructure, was assembled to ensure a thorough analysis. The expert team prepared reports on five subject areas to analyse and recommend adjustments to the unbundling exercise, which the OPMCM compiled. But the approval from the NCC still remains pending.The National Coordination Council meeting on July 1, 2023, originally mandated the completion and submission of the unbundling exercise within six months, with the understanding that a second meeting would convene for its review. After continued pressure from lawmakers and the Special Parliamentary Committee’s recommendations for federalism, the second Coordination Council meeting finally took place on February 7, 2024. The NCC reiterated its commitment to fulfilling decisions from its first meeting, with clear, time-bound directives to ensure progress. However, these decisions, including the approval of the unbundling exercise, have yet to be executed. While the Council’s decision to revise the exercise was a major achievement, the lack of implementation limits its impact. Once approved, the report is expected to streamline intergovernmental functions, reduce conflicts and enhance the performance of all three governments.Clarifying government responsibilities The 2015 Constitution defines functional responsibilities for each level of government, establishing areas for ‘self-rule’ and ‘shared governance’. However, these responsibilities remain ambiguous and often overlap across federal, provincial and local governments. In 2017, Nepal conducted an initial unbundling exercise to clarify roles and avoid conflicts. Despite these efforts, provincial and local governments continue to raise concerns, citing that the federal government often disregards the delineated responsibilities established through unbundling. Issues have emerged in planning, budgeting, lawmaking, fiscal transfers, administrative management and public order, where the federal government seems to be encroaching upon the autonomy of provincial and local governments. Local governments also report grievances about provincial governments, noting interference that hinders effective local governance.Sectoral overlap is evident in almost every domain—roads, drinking water, irrigation, education and agriculture. This leads to resource strains and service delivery inefficiencies. For instance, local road projects, which local authorities should ideally manage, often receive funding and direction from all government tiers. Federal agencies frequently allocate budgets for minor city roads, while provincial governments intervene in local infrastructure. Consequently, local governments manage projects shaped by federal and provincial funding or priorities, complicating planning, accountability and responsiveness to local needs. These challenges have sparked a call from sub-federal governments for a comprehensive review of the 2017 unbundling exercise. Revisiting this exercise to eliminate overlaps, establish clear guidelines and empower each government level according to its constitutional roles could prevent redundancy, improve accountability and enhance service delivery. Ultimately, clearer boundaries and responsibilities would benefit the people by ensuring government actions are coordinated and responsive to local needs.While the unbundling exercise has seen substantial progress, it remains unfinished and unapproved by the National Coordination Council. This delay raises critical questions: Where is the Unbundling Exercise? Why are local government associations and provincial leaders silent about its completion? The success of federalism hinges on clarifying and respecting each government level's roles and responsibilities. The delayed approval of the exercise continues to hinder the effective functioning of federalism in Nepal. \nNepal is increasingly under the siege of the adverse effects of climate change. This year too the country witnessed the monsoon continuing beyond the end of the normal monsoon season, flooding the country until late September. Similarly, in August, the glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) in Solukhumbu district swept away several houses and displaced 135 people in Thame village, a prominent destination in the Everest region. The fears about climate change seem to be coming true. Unfortunately, the worst is yet to come, with the Himalayas projected to reach the ‘peak GLOF risk’ by 2050, according to the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD). The Conference of the Parties (COP), the annual global platform on climate change, has provided developing countries with the opportunities to discuss the issue, negotiate compensation and demand accountability for the impacts of climate change with developed countries whose carbon emissions disproportionately drive global warming. As a negligible contributor to carbon emissions and among the most vulnerable countries to climate change, Nepal will conduct a high-level session on climate change under President Ram Chandra Paudel’s leadership in Baku, Azerbaijan today. The country’s agenda for COP-29 includes protecting its Himalayas, securing committed climate finance, improving access to climate funds and asking for the quick operation of the loss and damage fund established last year. Yet, a big question remains: Can Nepal’s leaders effectively convey these urgent needs at COP, and will these discussions lead to concrete action back home?Domestically, Nepal’s climate policies are often sidelined due to political inaction. The Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) should be updated to reflect developing climate scenarios and national priorities. Yet, from 2020 to 2023, Nepal’s NDCs remained stalled. Only last year was an updated version, also called the second NDC, finally approved. However, this leaves us less time to progress before countries submit updated NDCs by 2025. Moreover, in successive COPs, Nepal’s representatives have failed to make their case convincingly, reducing such conferences to formalities. The developed countries, for their part, meet, discuss and commit but fail to reduce the impacts of climate change by mitigating the use of fossil fuels. There are also concerns that Donald Trump, as the new American president, could pull the US out of the Paris Agreement, as he did in his last tenure. This will further dampen the spirit of such conferences. Despite such challenges, Nepal should continue to strongly raise its voice for compensation for low-carbon-emitting countries. It must also join hands and speak with one voice with other developing countries facing adverse effects of climate change. This year’s COP is focused on climate finance, but as important is securing firm commitments from high-emission countries to reduce their fossil fuel dependency. Without behaviour changes alongside financial support, progress will remain limited. Developing countries should consistently monitor these commitments; multilateral agencies like the United Nations, often criticised for toothlessness, should heed their concerns by holding developed nations to a higher sense of accountability. Last year, Nepal’s climate concerns received global exposure with UN Secretary-General António Guterres’s call for serious attention toward the Himalayas and the nation. Ahead of this year’s conference, Paudel and Guterres briefly discussed climate change issues during their journey to Baku, Azerbaijan. Failing to capitalise on this attention or underplaying Nepal’s role at the conference would be a missed opportunity with lasting repercussions. Our climate leaders can make much more of the COP platform to protect lives and livelihoods at home. \nExactly a year ago, the then Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government banned TikTok after introducing the ‘Directives on the Operation of Social Networking 2023’. Many considered this an attack on freedom of expression. Just when people seemed to have grown accustomed to the ban, the current KP Sharma Oli-led government lifted the nine-month restriction on the platform on August 22. Last week, TikTok finalised its registration process in line with the 2023 directives. With the video-sharing platform officially registered and operational in the country, the debate around it seems to have subsided. But how does registration make the platform better, and why was the ban implemented so suddenly if it was going to be reversed just as swiftly?According to the Internet Service Providers Association, TikTok accounted for nearly 40 percent of the country’s internet bandwidth, with around 2.2 million users in Nepal before the ban. Unlike countries like India, which decided to ban TikTok citing privacy and security concerns, the intent of “stopping and curbing social ills and anarchy” was the sole reason highlighted by the Nepali government while banning it last year. Previously, the government stated that registration was necessary due to a rise in user complaints and the absence of company representatives in the country, which made it challenging to address concerns. Now, although our laws apply to TikTok within our territory, it remains unclear how action will be taken against legal violations. In fact, the regulations in place are not sufficient and clear enough for proper implementation. The Electronic Transaction Act, 2063 (2008) does not address specific cyber-related crimes and emerging threats such as revenge porn and online prostitution. Further, the 2023 directives specify that the point of contact must identify content that violates the guidelines, such as material promoting obscenity, vulgarity, or hate speech. However, these terms are left open to interpretation, as they lack clear definitions.Although the Cyber Bureau can collaborate with TikTok to take action, a recent Post report revealed that the bureau is critically understaffed and underfunded, with only 106 personnel. Among the staff, only a few are capable of solving cases, while the remaining ones are given administrative duties. What’s intriguing is that TikTok alone was scrutinised and banned, although the directives mandate that all social media platforms register with the Ministry of Information and Communication Technology. The video-sharing platform is only the third company to register with the ministry in Nepal after Viber and WeChat. According to the prime minister, social media platforms must be treated equally, so why are Facebook, X and Instagram, with 10.58 million, 4.66 million and 3.60 million users, respectively, allowed to operate without registration?The Australian government recently announced a ban preventing children under 16 from using social media, a decision that was met with harsh criticism. Meanwhile, in Bangladesh, the interim government’s repeal of the draconian Cyber Security Act—previously used to curb press freedom—was widely welcomed. These examples show that countries around the world are experimenting and finding ways to address the challenges of a rapidly evolving digital landscape. Social media platforms are interconnected and constantly shifting, with features like short-form videos, once unique to TikTok, now available across other platforms. This suggests banning platforms may not be the most practical way to address social media’s negative aspects. Rather than relying on populist measures, our government should invest in digital literacy and research to create thoughtful, viable regulations. Moreover, the law should apply to all rather than randomly selected platforms.  \nEven at the best of times, there is no shortage of irritants in Nepal-India relations. It would be wise for the governments of both the countries not to add to the list. Yet that is not how India sees things. For over three months, the southern neighbour has stopped importing most categories of Nepali goods. The reason is that the manufacturers of these products don’t have the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) certificates. These certificates supposedly guarantee that the products India imports are of high quality. Yet it is an open secret that when New Delhi imposed mandatory certification in 2020, it did so to stop the import from the neighbourhood of all goods with Chinese components. A related problem is that Indian inspection teams have not visited the Nepali factories in order to certify their products, even months after these factories applied for the certification. This new episode of import restriction raises many questions.For example, why have the imports been stopped now even though the BIS certificates were made mandatory in 2020? How can India stop the import of goods with Chinese components when even Indian manufacturers—be they pharmaceutical companies or steel plants—would come to a halt without the import of raw material from China? India agreed to help build a standard certification lab in Nepal, way back in 2009. Why hasn’t the lab been set up yet? And at a time when India-China relations are reported to be warming up thanks to the breakthrough in their border talks, why continue to take such a rigid position on the import of goods with Chinese components? In informal talks, the decision-makers in New Delhi tend to pass the buck to the lower level functionaries when such issues are raised. For instance, the latest restrictions on imports of goods is apparently not in line with New Delhi’s policies; it is the Indian custom officials and other bureaucrats who are putting up the hurdles. There is some truth in this argument. Of late India is so occupied with big powers like the US, China and Russia, the Indian political leadership has little time for smaller countries in the neighbourhood. They thus ‘delegate’ the handling of these countries to junior bureaucrats and spies. But if so, it is a disastrous policy. India will struggle to be a credible actor on the global stage if it first cannot establish such credibility in its own neighbourhood. We have already seen the dangers of New Delhi’s excess reliance on bureaucrats to handle regional affairs, most recently in Bangladesh. When students there rose up in arms, the Indian political leadership was caught off guard. Perhaps because of this neglect of the neighbourhood, India’s old ‘backyard’ is slowly slipping out of its control. It won’t be an exaggeration to say that if the Indian political leadership wants, this issue of import restrictions can be solved overnight. Really, why would they let small irritants snowball into a full-blown crisis? In Nepal’s case, India must understand that the landlocked country has no option but to import at least some raw material and expertise from China. Making such imports is in no way tantamount to Nepal going into ‘Chinese hands’ as some hyperventilating Indian TV anchors like to put it. That is impossible given the multi-dimensional connectivity between Nepal and India. India has long since shaken off its British shackles, but as Nepali manufacturers and exporters now aver, rightly or not, the colonial hangover remains.   \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli is preparing to visit China in the first week of December. It will be his first bilateral visit after assuming the office in mid-July. Nepali prime ministers generally go to New Delhi first. Sudheer Sharma, former editor-in-chief of Kantipur daily, has recently published a pair of books on Nepal-China relations—‘Himalpari ko Huri’ and ‘Bhikshu, Byapar ra Bidroha’. He also frequently writes on Nepal’s relations with its two big neighbours. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Sharma on the eve of Oli’s China visit. Prime Minister Oli is all set to visit China next month. Many find it curious that he decided to go to Beijing first before visiting New Delhi. How do you see this development?Traditionally, Nepali prime ministers have given high priority to visits and engagements with our two neighbours–India and China. This is natural. Generally, the prime ministers first visited India and then went to China. I believe Prime Minister Oli tried to do the same. We see regular engagements with New Delhi at various levels. Prime Minister Oli had met his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York in the last week of September. In August, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba visited India and met Prime Minister Modi and her counterpart S Jaishankar, among other key officials there. But Delhi has yet to extend the invitation to the prime minister. So he seems to have decided not to defer his foreign visits for long and chose to visit Beijing first. We have to see this in two perspectives. Prime Minister Oli is visiting China at the invitation of Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang and he is also going to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping. Even in the past, Oli developed good relations with Chinese leaders. So, there are expectations that he may make the visit fruitful. An equally important concern is whether this visit impacts our relations with the southern neighbour India. I think the prime minister should focus on implementing the agreements reached during his previous visits to Beijing and during Chinese leaders’ Nepal visits. He should be mindful of not irking the southern neighbour while reaching any agreement with the northern one. I believe the prime minister is conscious of this.India often seems anxious about Chinese involvement in Nepal. Do you see any risk of this visit increasing the distance between Oli and India?Maoist leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal visited China first after he became prime minister in 2008. Even in the past, some Nepali prime ministers including Tanka Prasad Acharya went to China on their first official visit. This is not unusual. The two prime ministers—Oli and Modi—recently met in New York. India doesn’t seem ready to intensify bilateral engagements with Nepal immediately. So it is natural for the prime minister to increase engagements with China, without taking any steps that could provoke India. We should stop seeking Indian signals when dealing with China, and vice versa. We should maintain parallel relations with both the neighbours without antagonising any side.In this context, what should be the prime minister’s priorities during his China visit?We have to end our chronic problem of signing agreements and not implementing them. We make announcements and forget them. There are also some infrastructure projects China pledged to develop but there is little progress. So the prime minister should draw the Chinese leadership’s attention and press them to complete the projects on time. Some important projects such as Mugling-Pokhara and Narayanghat-Butwal road upgradation by the Chinese side have been slow, causing hardships to people. Even such issues should be communicated to the political level. Also, there are several commitments made by the Chinese government but left unimplemented. This creates an impression that China makes big promises but doesn’t keep them. Prime Minister Oli often highlights the Tokha-Chhahare road upgrade project under Chinese support but there is no satisfactory progress. Progress on preparing the detailed project report (DPR) on Nepal-China cross-border railway is unclear as well. Nepal expected some substantive support from China to make the Pokhara international airport financially feasible. Some concrete steps are needed to operate this airport. There are reports that the government has requested China to convert the loan taken to develop the airport into a grant and the prime minister will push for this during his visit. It will be an achievement if the prime minister succeeds in this. In the course of writing your recent books, you extensively interacted with Chinese officials and experts, as well as with their Nepali counterparts. What are the major factors delaying the projects? Is it lack of preparation on the Nepali side or is there any problem on the Chinese side?First, we [Nepalis] sign agreements but don’t work seriously to implement them. This is true in the case of agreements with other countries as well. We are negligent. Red tape is another problem. Third, China gives less priority to small countries like Nepal as it has so many big issues with other countries. We have to constantly follow up with them to speed things up. In the past, the two sides agreed to open more border points. This should be expedited. The people-to-people relations on the border areas were historically based on social interactions at the community level. People used to trade, marry those from the other side and interact in various ways. Of late, despite progress on infrastructure development, social engagement has been hindered. This should be rectified and new border points should be opened at Dolpa, Mustang, Gorkha, Dolakha, Taplejung, and Sankhuwasabha. We should think beyond the Capital-centric approach. This will help strengthen relations at the people’s level and give alternatives in our connectivity. We should put connectivity at the core of our relations with the two neighbours. In the past decade, we have made good progress in improving connectivity with India. A study report has been prepared on the Raxaul-Kathmandu railway project. We are building an expressway linking Kathmandu and the southern belt of the country. Integrated check posts (ICPs) have come into operation along Nepal-India border points. Cross border electricity transmission lines have been built and we have increased energy trade with India. We have thus progressed in deepening connectivity with India. We lack reliable north-south highways. Therefore, the prime minister should make connectivity a major agenda of his China visit. Given the lacklustre performance of past projects, can we be optimistic about big cross-border infra projects under Chinese help?Nepal and China have committed to run some projects under the Trans-Himalayan Multi Dimensional Connectivity Network (THMDCN) concept. A key component of this concept is to upgrade connectivity between Kathmandu and Kerung that includes roads as well as a railway. The concept also envisions operating other border points. The railway project requires more study and investment and needs to consider various other factors. For now, we should prioritise opening the aforementioned border points. The Korala border point at Mustang has huge potential. Nepal is making a road that connects Mustang with the Sunauli border point with India. Centuries ago, people from Banaras used to travel to Tibet via Mustang through this route. It can be revived and made a trilateral trade route between Nepal, India and China. Similarly, Limi in Humla, Olangchugola in Taplejung, among others places, can be developed as alternative routes. As far as Kerung-Kathmandu connection is concerned, let’s first give priority to building a reliable highway. The railway project should be developed with a broader understanding between Nepal, India and China. Beijing will develop such a big project only with the big Indian markets in mind. More importantly, there are some signs of improvements in India-China relations. We have to use this as an opportunity.There are differences in the way we work and the Chinese do and there are systemic and linguistic differences as well. These factors are often blamed for lack of progress in development activities carried out with Chinese support. Can Nepalis work closely with Chinese, just like we do with Indians?Until a decade ago, several projects developed under Indian support were left in limbo. In 2015, India imposed a blockade against Nepal and that sparked anti-India sentiment. Then, India expedited several projects. This drastic change became possible as the political leadership in India realised its mistake and showed the commitment to improve things.But the same thing is not happening with China because there is a “great wall” between Nepal and China when it comes to understanding each other. The Chinese haven’t understood Nepali context. The northern neighbour should be more open and liberal in helping Nepal. Second, Nepal should also stop approaching China only when our relations with India sour. We have left this impression on the Chinese psyche. First, we should be clear about what exactly we want from China, forge consensus among major political forces and hold talks with the Chinese leaders. Then, we should be equally committed to implementing the agreements reached this way. People now take announcements of building big projects under Chinese support as propaganda. Therefore, this time the prime minister should stress on pushing the pending projects. The prime minister should tell them that even the projects announced during President Xi’s visit have not progressed and that has created a bad impression of China in Nepal.There are some differences between the coalition partners—the CPN-UML and the Nepali Congress—about the funding modality of projects under the Belt and Road Initiatives (BRI). Do you think this may cause a problem?The UML wants to expedite the BRI projects while the Congress has insisted that we should accept only grants and not loans under the BRI. The prime minister should clear such dilemmas and come up with common views before he leaves for Beijing. Once they come up with a common view on such key issues, it will give a positive and strong message. The Chinese side will take it more seriously because the strong government led by the two largest parties can implement bilateral agreements.We have instances of Nepal’s political parties standing for and against important projects funded by other countries. This was seen in the case of the US-funded Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), and China’s BRI. Moreover, in the past, the Chinese leaders created an impression that they preferred working with communist parties and leaders. This is neither in the interest of Nepal nor of China.There are also discussions on signing the BRI implementation plan during the visit. What are the things Nepal should be careful about while signing BRI-related agreements?Trying to get grants instead of loans is in itself good. But there is no need to be prejudiced against the BRI per se. Nepal reportedly wants to include some points specifying waivers in specific projects. We should be very careful while signing project-based agreements. For instance, what will be the conditions and funding modality of a project, will it be developed under grants or loans etcetera. All our technical experts and other brains should be engaged while signing project-based agreements and specifying conditions and other nitty-gritty to ensure that we will not have unnecessary liability and debt burden in the future. Over time, Nepal has rightly adopted a steadfast position saying that we don’t join a strategic alliance proposed by any country. It stayed away from the US government’s State Partnership Programme (SPP) and China’s Global Security Initiative (GSI) as well as from India’s security umbrella. But we can’t be isolated in development initiatives. We have to take support from India, China, the US and other countries based on our needs.Do you think the Chinese side will show magnanimity on Nepal’s requests, for instance on waiving off the loan to develop Pokhara international airport?Though the Chinese ambassador to Nepal last year claimed the airport project to be under the BRI, the case is different because it was signed years before we joined the BRI. And, converting that loan into a grant is not a big deal for China. They should show magnanimity given the support we have been providing to China for a long time. If you see things historically, Nepal has helped China by suppressing Khampa revolt, preventing free Tibet movements on our soil and showing a steadfast commitment to One-China policy. China, which is now prosperous, should definitely show magnanimity and waive off loan of Pokhara airport. They shouldn’t see relations with Nepal through a purely transactional lens.In your book, you describe 2008 as a watershed after which the engagements between Nepal and China increased drastically. But why couldn’t we benefit from the northern neighbour in terms of development?The Chinese side looks more interested in increasing engagement. They like to showcase their development before foreigners. But more than lavish hospitality, we need substantive support from the neighbour, which has emerged as the world’s second-largest economy. But we should be clear about what we want from our engagements with China.  The Nepali side doesn’t present its proposals clearly. On certain issues, our politicians give mixed signals. This time, if this government of two largest parties reaches a certain agreement with China and remains committed to implement it, other forces can’t hinder it. The same approach can be replicated while dealing with India, the US, Japan or other friendly countries.Is difficult geography still a barrier in developing cross-border infrastructure projects and deepening relations between Nepal and China?In our textbooks we read that the Himalayan range is a natural barrier between the two countries. In my book ‘Bhikshu Byapar ra Bidroha’, I have explored and described how people from Nepal and northern India had been traversing through these mountains and there were interactions and engagements between the people in this part of the world since the 5th and 6th centuries. So, the mountains weren’t barriers even at that time. Now technology has made things easier. We have to think about how to connect with these two big economies. We have multiple east-west highways. Now we need north-south highways connecting the three countries that will help us reap benefits from India and China.At present, relations between these two countries have improved and it is an opportunity for us. We have to forge understanding with both India and China if we have to materialise big projects based on trilateral agreement. One thing we can’t accept is the concept of two-plus-one (India, China plus Nepal). That is unacceptable because it downgrades Nepal to a junior partner. We need trilateral agreements to develop mega connectivity-related and other investment projects but such agreements should be made on an equal-footing between the three countries. \nFormer chief election commissioner Bhojraj Pokharel successfully conducted the first Constituent Assembly election in 2008. He resigned from the position in 2009, after which he dedicated himself in the study of national and international politics. The Secretary-General of the United Nations appointed him to serve on several high-level panels—for Bangladesh’s 2008 parliamentary elections and for South Sudan’s referendum process in 2010-11. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Pokharel to better understand Nepal’s own electoral system and the influence of big business on its political parties.The latest episode of Bhatbhateni Supermarket owner Min Bahadur Gurung providing land to CPN-UML and his announcement of a sophisticated party office building at the land has of late been a topic of hot debate. People see this as an example of how politicians and businessmen work in collusion. How do you see it?Our legal provisions in this connection have some loopholes. The law allows political parties to collect donations to run their organisations, to contest elections and to carry out other activities. The law is silent on who can make such donations and how much they can do it. This is a gap in our law. Our political parties have for long been misusing the loopholes, and now they are doing so openly. The laws have also identified some sources of income for the parties such as the levy by their members, donations they get and the incomes the parties make in various ways. The amount they earn from these sources is negligible. But most major corruption cases, and mainly policy-related corruption, are linked to those who fund the political parties. This in turn is linked to the trend of elections increasingly becoming expensive. Politicians need money and those with money need access to powerful politicians. So, this is mutually beneficial for politicians and businesspeople. Such activities have been taking place for decades, but the level of such collusion has increased significantly of late.Is accepting donations from Gurung problematic as there are pending corruption and fraud cases against him or is accepting donations from business people inherently questionable?Our law hasn’t set clear criteria in this connection. Laws in some countries have categorically defined certain fundamental things such as from whom parties can take donations, how much and what type of money they can accept and how to make the deal transparent. In developed democracies, political financing is strictly monitored and regulated. In our case, we didn’t even fix the limit of the amount a businessperson can donate to a political party and whether that should be linked to the profit and tax the person pays to the state. Even the individuals who haven’t paid tax to the state citing losses in their businesses might be donating big sums to political parties or individual politicians. Therefore, there should be certain criteria to regulate political financing. Certain provisions empower the Election Commission to take action. For instance, if someone wants to help a political party or a candidate financially with more than Rs25,000, the person has to give the money through a bank. The commission can cancel someone’s candidacy or take other actions if the candidate is found to have made excessive expenses in breach of election laws. But our agencies are weak in terms of enforcement. The political parties submit the details of their financial transactions but that is often audited by a chartered accountant who might be a party cadre. The Election Commission hasn’t succeeded in investigating such malpractices. Will a law on conflict of interest help control such malpractices?We need a couple of things soon. First, the state should formulate and enforce a law on conflict of interest. It will define certain issues on conflict of interest involving politicians, business people and other stakeholders and make the officials making decisions accountable. Second, there is a need to define what are policy decisions and what aren’t. Of late, there is tendency of making decisions from Cabinet meetings to avoid prosecution from the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) as the anti-corruption body is not allowed to investigate Cabinet’s policy decisions. The CIAA leadership has an excuse not to get involved in the decisions of the politicians who appoint them. All Cabinet decisions are not policy decisions. So, it has become urgent to define what are policy decisions and what aren’t and what kind of issues the CIAA and other investigating agencies can investigate.People in general say that corruption has of late increased. Is that the case?There is no society completely free of corruption. I have been observing the functioning of our state mechanisms for the past five decades. During the Panchayat [1960-1990], everything was controlled by the palace. And, the royals and their kin were linked when there was a high-level corruption case. In the 1980s, a corruption case involving the procurement of a Boeing surfaced. A commission led by a Supreme Court justice showed the involvement of prince Gyanendra [who later became King] but its report was not implemented as the then King Birendra didn’t muster the courage to take action against his own brother. At the time, politicians didn’t dare to get involved in serious corruption cases as there was a fear of action from the palace. Over time, the volume of corruption increased with the increment in the amount of financial transactions. There is corruption even in countries like Japan and South Korea that have made exemplary progress in development. Leaders including prime ministers, ministers have been prosecuted and even faced jail terms on corruption charges. Based on that, some argue that corruption is somehow attached to development because there is mobilisation of huge resources. But there is a big difference with what is happening here. There, they take action against whoever is involved. Presidents and prime ministers have been jailed, some have even committed suicide. But in our case, top political leadership is not prosecuted. The other aspect is that after the reinstatement of democracy and the start of the republican order, the media made more corruption cases public, which was not the case during the King’s regime.Do you see any connection between the political parties and the rampant corruption in recent decades?Our party organisations became too burdensome. In developed democracies, political parties become active when there is a need for their role. At other times, they go ‘into hibernation’. The party leaders and members return to their regular businesses and remain busy there. For instance, at present, the Democrats and Republicans in the US have concentrated all their energy to help their respective candidates win. Once the election is over, they return to their regular businesses. Similar is the situation in other developed democracies. This happens when a democracy attains maturity. Conversely, in our case, the cadres are totally dependent on their organisations. And even general people want things done through party channels. From the grassroots to the centre, people go to party offices for recommendations to get something done from government agencies. This is how parties have become parallel power centres to the state agencies. The government bodies have been weakened. Hence, the way our political organisations, their leaders and cadres are managed has become the source of corruption. And it has weakened elected governments because they aren’t allowed to work independently. Government officials are also forced to work as per the order given by a head of the local chapter of a political party, not by the elected representatives with people’s mandate.There is another more concerning trend. These days the government’s decisions are influenced by certain interest groups that have huge money. There are around two dozen big business houses who influence the state’s decision-making process no matter which party leads the government. First they make informal decisions on certain key issues. Then, the Parliament, a government agency, or a court, whichever is concerned, endorses it. So now the real power doesn’t lie with elected representatives or state agencies. The interest groups wield real power.How to stop it?The state should fund political parties to cover their genuine expenses such as election expenditures and regular costs needed to run party organisations. This helps break the nexus between politicians and business tycoons and to check corruption. Once the political parties get money from state coffers, their expenditures will be strictly regulated by the law. They won’t be allowed to take outside donations. After that, the Office of the Auditor General will audit their accounts.But how can we ensure the parties and their leaders are taking no donations even after they get state funding?The law will bar both the donors and recipients from being involved in offering and taking donations. Then, the donors can say that they can’t give money to the political parties as that will be a crime of breaching the law. The policy only works if the state agencies strongly enforce the law.Other countries have made huge progress in terms of development despite corruption being rampant there. Why do we lag behind?We adopted the form of governance that accepts Parliament as the most sovereign body. But, in reality, the power lies with the chiefs of three major parties. The Parliament rubber stamps whatever they decide. And, they are influenced by certain interest groups. The legislature seeks political parties’ decisions even to follow its procedures. The other most powerful institution as per our constitution is the prime minister. But, in reality, the prime minister always struggles to appease coalition partners. Another important state pillar is the judiciary, which has been weakened by politicisation. Constitutional bodies could have played an important check and balance role but the politicians wanted to use them to serve their interests. With the weakening and non-functioning of state agencies, misrule prevails. In other countries, laws and state agencies work, and therefore they progressed.Is there a viable way to clean up our corrupt system? First the leaders that messed things up and brought the country to this situation should retire. The leaders who led historic political movements have failed to maintain their height. The narrative of ‘there is no hope’ has spread. This will not stop unless the present leadership retires. Things will improve if they voluntarily retire from politics. But they aren’t ready for that.How do you evaluate the present government’s performance after its 100 days in office?I was optimistic at the beginning and expected that they would work differently and instil hope in the people, mainly on good governance. But they gave continuity to the same mistakes they committed in the past. As the two largest parties are in the government, they have a chance to sow hope in the country, but the signs in the past 100 days aren’t encouraging. They deserve credit for the initiative to amend transitional justice related laws and to begin the process to constitute the two TJ bodies. Also, the government successfully restored connection of the Kathmandu Valley with other parts of the country after the devastating floods and landslides.Our major concern is that if this experiment of a government of two largest parties fails, it will raise questions over our system. It won’t be limited to the failure of the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, it will be projected as a failure of the system. A number of groups are unhappy with the system the present constitution adopted in 2015. The governing parties’ failure will give them a ground to raise questions over the system, at a time when a large section of the society is fed up with seeing “the same old faces”. Individual leaders’ failure may push our democratic system in a crisis. This is more concerning. At the time of forming this coalition, they said that they joined hands due to the special circumstances of the country. But they didn’t work as per the special needs.You wrote a book entitled Preventing Election Violence Through Diplomacy in 2020 after a comprehensive research on some African countries. Do you see any similarities between politics of Africa and Nepal?In the course of that research, I studied some elected as well as non-elected dictators in Africa and Latin America. The dictators always think along the lines of ‘me and mine’. Instead of strengthening state agencies, they want to turn the agencies in their favour. Over time, some dictators realise they are making one mistake after another and they reach a point where they want to quit. But the coterie that surrounds the leader doesn’t allow him or her to quit. Those who are benefitting from the rule even threaten to kill the dictator if he/she plans to call it quits. Then, the dictators want some external intervention, beyond the tight circle. I found such circumstances in my case studies. It is so unfortunate that I see something similar happening in Nepal. The way a group of people encircle our top leaders and defend even their wrongdoings, it gives me a feeling of deja vu. In our case, some leaders are advised not to quit as a true successor has not been groomed.  \nDuring his term as home minister in the previous Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government that was toppled in mid-July, Narayan Kaji Shrestha, who is also senior vice-chair of the CPN (Maoist Centre), undertook some bold actions. He swung into action on high profile corruption cases such as Bhutanese refugee scam, Lalita Niwas land grab and cross-border gold smuggling. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal met him on Sunday to ask him of the performance of the new government, the saga around the arrest of Rastriya Swatantra Party chair Rabi Lamichhane.CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, as leader of the main opposition party, convened a joint meeting of opposition parties on Friday. It seems the opposition parties want to solidify their unity against the ruling coalition. What will be the opposition camp’s strategy to build pressure on the government?The government has not been effective in relief distribution, rehabilitation and reconstruction in the areas ravaged by the devastating floods and landslides in the last week of September. Therefore, we convened the meeting to draw the government’s attention to this sorry state of affairs. Second, right since the formation of this government [in mid-July], we suspected this coalition would play a negative role in terms of controlling corruption as the present coalition partners joined hands after being scared of the anti-corruption movement launched by our government [led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal]. It has become imperative to stop the government from doing wrong things and alert the people. Third, there are suspicions that the government is preparing to make it easier for dissident groups in various parties to split political parties by amending the Political Parties Act-2017 through an ordinance. Thus, we basically wanted to press the government to effectively carry out the post-disaster rehabilitation works and stop it from various wrongdoings.Are there specific issues on which the opposition camp wants to build pressure?Effective work on rehabilitation and reconstruction in the disaster-hit areas is our immediate demand. In the long-run, we want to raise the agenda of good governance because developing Nepal as a prosperous country and ensuring social justice should be our central mission. But this isn’t possible without first curbing rampant corruption. Unfortunately, the government is taking a negative approach in this connection.Could you give more specific details where the government went wrong in terms of corruption?To take the latest example, the CPN-UML, which is headed by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, recently accepted a donation of land worth tens of millions of rupees from Min Bahadur Gurung, owner of the country’s largest retail chain, Bhatbhateni Supermarket. The business tycoon has also announced plans to make a building for the party. During our tenure, the government filed a corruption case against him in Lalita Niwas land scam. He was arrested and later the Special Court convicted him of corruption. The land has already been retained as government property. Later, he moved the Supreme Court, where the case is sub judice. Prime Minister Oli had earlier vented his ire for arresting and filing a case against Gurung. We had suspected that he had done something wrong in collusion with Gurung. Oli’s acceptance of the property in the name of donation is unacceptable on political and moral grounds. It is against the good governance drive we launched. You know, we had initiated action in various major corruption scams during our tenure. There are reports that the government is trying to give clean chit to the accused instead of taking the process ahead. Thus the present coalition is working against good governance.In the meeting of the opposition coalition on Friday, Rastriya Swatantra Party chair Rabi Lamichhane, who was arrested on Saturday, sought support of other opposition parties [based on the information that he was being arrested] arguing that action against him was politically motivated. Will the opposition parties support him?Any case should be independently and fairly investigated. No culprit should be spared. At the same time, no political bias should reflect in the investigation. We can’t say anything about the government agencies’ investigation process. The meeting stressed on the same. It was during my tenure as home minister that the government initiated the investigation against Lamichhane after a supplementary case was registered at the Kaski District Police Office, accusing him of misusing deposits from a Kaski-based cooperative. Later, the parliament formed a special probe committee to investigate. Now the home ministry has taken action against him based on the recommendation of the same panel. We have to cooperate with the government in its investigation. The only thing we can say is that the investigation should be fair and independent. No political party can stand against the investigation itself. How do you see the protests by the RSP cadres following his arrest?They can raise their voice against the possibility of political revenge in the case and demand fair investigation. But they have to cooperate in the investigation and accept the findings. No one can obstruct the investigation just because someone is a politician. The government agencies can’t enforce rule of law if all political parties start protesting against investigations on individuals affiliated to them. A few of the RSP’s concerns are valid too. They argue that the government is working in a discriminatory way. For instance, there are reports with evidence showing involvement of some Nepali Congress and CPN-UML leaders in various cooperatives’ scams. They have asked why the government is not taking any action against them. This is a valid question. The authorities should take action against Congress and UML leaders as well to prove that the government is not discriminatory.Various high-profile corruption cases were prosecuted during your tenure as home minister. You understand if a case has been built on strong or weak grounds. From that perspective, what is your observation of Lamichhane’s case?Rabi ji himself has accepted a level of involvement in the case and said that he is ready to bear the financial liability of the cooperative money invested in the Gorkha Media Network [where he was managing director]. I can comment about the overall case only after the investigation is completed.The fact that over half-a-dozen home ministers since 1990 have been prosecuted in corruption cases shows powerful politicians are involved in corruption. Can this deep-rooted corruption be cleaned up?It is one of the major reasons hindering Nepal’s development. Corruption is promoted by those who are in key state positions. Therefore, we often say our state agencies are influenced by comprador capitalists and there is no investment in productive sectors that would create jobs. Our entire economic ecosystem of creating demand, production, supply and employment has failed. The nexus between powerful politicians, bureaucrats and a handful of business tycoons is promoting activities from where they get huge commissions, and where they get to exploit state coffers. Nepal can’t progress without breaking this nexus. We had taken strong actions in that direction. Unfortunately, the present coalition stopped that process and the comprador capitalists have yet again become active.You must have faced pressure from the political and other quarters when you took action against powerful leaders. Could you give some examples of such pressure?You know, though our party led the government, the other party [Nepali Congress] was the bigger force in the coalition government and actions were taken against the major leaders of the coalition partners. Even those who were affiliated to our party faced actions. So, definitely I faced immense political pressure. But no one could stop me as I was determined to complete my mission of good governance. But a section of people accuse you of sparing individuals close to top leaders and that some individuals were later freed on bail as the cases against them weren’t built as strongly.That is not the case. I pushed the cases despite huge political pressures. But the court later freed them on bail, where we have no role. The court has put some individuals behind bars while some were released. The role of the court is certainly a matter of research. You are right that people wonder why more powerful people aren’t brought under investigation even in big scams such as Bhutanese refugee scam and Lalita Niwas land grab. Media reports indicating powerful individuals’ involvement might be true. However, the government agencies can’t take action against anyone without sufficient evidence. Many have asked why two former prime ministers—Madhav Kumar Nepal and Baburam Bhattarai—were not prosecuted. The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) didn’t recommend action against them saying that the policy decisions made in Cabinet meetings don’t fall under its jurisdiction. And, it is still unclear which decisions made in the Cabinet are policy decisions and which aren’t.The secretaries who prepare proposals for Cabinet decisions are held responsible while the ministers who present the same proposals for a decision at the Cabinet meeting and the chief of the Cabinet are not held responsible. People have raised questions about this practice. I think this is a valid question and should be addressed properly. I also believe the ministers who present a proposal for a decision should be held responsible.Also questions were raised over the way the statements of the two prime ministers [Nepal and Bhattarai] were recorded at their homes and in the absence of a government attorney.I take this criticism positively. When I enquired about this episode, police told me that they did so because the CIAA had earlier recorded other former prime ministers at their homes and the police followed the same precedent. In the future, we should be careful. There is one crucial aspect in this case. The two prime ministers weren’t prosecuted in the Lalita Niwas land grab case. But the court has proved that the land deal was wrong. So, it has been recovered as government property. Thus, the decisions taken from the Cabinet meetings [chaired by Nepal and Bhattarai] were wrong. Don’t they need to do public self-criticism?Let’s move on to party politics. As in the past, leaders in your party rigorously discussed the issue of leadership change in Maoist Centre in recent meetings. But nothing happened. Do you see any chance of leadership change in the Maoist Centre?In our recent party meetings, we discussed whether the party’s transformation is more important or leadership change. We need a more unified, transformed and stronger party to implement our party’s agenda in national politics. This is more important. We discussed whether our leadership at present is obstructing this process. Our leadership is ready to work to transform the party, make the organisation stronger and then hand over the leadership. Our chair wants to take the party back to its past strength. We have taken his spirit positively. But this doesn’t mean that Prachanda [Dahal] is irreplaceable.Amid reports about reunification between various Maoist parties, party chairman Dahal and Nepal Communist Party General Secretary Netra Bikram Chand have both spoken on the need for such reunification. Is it happening soon?Our conclusion is that our party can take leadership in carrying out important national tasks. In principle we are in the right direction but the party can’t accomplish the tasks in its present form. So it needs to be made stronger. The ideological and moral grounds of our party have eroded. We have been distanced from downtrodden communities while party leaders have increased proximity with the well-off class. On the other hand, corruption has increased within the party. Therefore, we want to transform the party into a more revolutionary and stronger force. This should be the priority. But even after that, our party’s present strength alone will not suffice to accomplish important national tasks. So we have decided to join hands with more left and Maoist forces. Discussions with various groups for party unity and forging alliances are underway.Reports say the negotiation with the Chand-led party is more positive.The [Chand-led] party made two important decisions from a central committee meeting. They decided to go for party unity and take part in the next general elections. This is an important policy departure of the party. It has increased the possibility of party unity. But we haven’t reached any definite conclusion in this connection. Do you see any chances of forging a working alliance with new forces such as the RSP?The new forces raised an agenda [of good governance] and got good support from the public in elections. But people have already started complaining against them saying that they didn’t work as per their promises. They have started comparing them to traditional forces. The new leaders from whom people had expected a lot have already courted controversy. Having said that, we can’t brush aside the public disenchantment towards major political forces as well.The RSP champions an agenda which is quite different from what the Maoist Centre lobbies for. For instance, the policies the Maoist Centre and the RSP advocate on the federal system are opposite. In this context, can the two parties be long-term allies?The RSP has failed to be honest to the agenda it championed in the elections and to make its political ideology clear. And it has adopted a wrong policy on the federal system. Therefore, at present, we can’t say that we will have a long-term strategic collaboration. There is no reliable basis for that. As far as a working alliance is concerned, it can be with any party. For instance, we have diametrically opposed political viewpoints with the Rastriya Prajatantra Party. They want monarchy while we are strongly for the republic system. They are against federalism while we want a stronger federal system. But we can still forge a working alliance with them on certain agendas.Opposition parties seem quite scared of ordinance on Political Parties Act-2017. There is a need to end the legal void that exists after Congress-Maoist Centre government issued an ordinance three years ago. Is it based on the information about certain provisions that the government is implementing or because it is being brought by bypassing the parliament?It is true that there has been delay in reviving the provisions of the law that were inactivated after introduction of the ordinance at the time. We want that to be done through parliament. Now the government wants to make changes in it because it wants to meet certain vested political interests through it. There are suspicions that the present government leadership is working to split small parties and make the UML the largest in the House of Representatives.Why would Congress help the prime minister bring an ordinance that would make it smaller than the UML?That is why they might be at loggerheads over the issue. What I heard is that both the proposals to arrest Rabi Lamichhane and to issue the ordinance on the Political Parties Act-2017 were discussed in the same Cabinet meeting. The Congress reportedly pushed for the proposal on Lamichhane while the prime minister was for issuing the ordinance as well. It is certain that there is a tug of war between the two sides over the ordinance. \nCentral and eastern parts of Nepal witnessed devastating incidents of landslides and floods last week. At least 244 people were killed, while 19 are still missing. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Basanta Raj Adhikari, director at the Centre for Disaster Studies, Institute of Engineering at Tribhuvan University, to discuss how the country can be better prepared to manage the disasters and minimise damages.Recently we faced disastrous floods and landslides. How do you analyse the losses? Could the damages have been reduced with better preparation and timely response?To begin with, I want to make one thing clear. There is a fundamental difference between a disaster and hazard. Hazard is always natural but it becomes a disaster if there is human involvement. If there is a landslide in a jungle with no human activity, it is a hazard. If a landslide hit a human settlement and it required external involvement to restore the place, then it becomes a disaster. An earthquake is a hazard but it becomes a disaster when man-made structures kill people. As far as the losses from the recent floods are concerned, we could have minimised them with better preparation. For instance, Nakkhu was one of the worst hit areas in the Kathmandu Valley. The river there has drastically narrowed and a human settlement has been developed on the riverbanks in recent years. Human activities in rivers are natural as human civilisations took place on the banks of rivers. But it should be done without disrupting the natural flow of the water. We developed huge settlements encroaching the riverbanks. This invited huge losses. Such activities could have been avoided.As Nepal witnessed record-high rainfalls, were not these losses to be expected? It is true that the country witnessed record rainfalls this season, the highest in the past over five decades. Climate change has caused extreme weather events in recent years. But we can’t blame only natural factors. If you see the images of 2003, it clearly shows that the place where the MediCity Hospital now stands is clearly the floodplain of the Nakkhu river. If you go further downstream, you see a colony. This is how we have encroached riverbanks. We can encroach rivers but it should be done in a scientific way. What is scientific encroachment of rivers?We can model flooding based on the highest volume of water a river can carry. Based on such evidence, we can decide what kind of activities can and cannot be carried out on a riverbank. We can develop settlements but that should be based on scientific evidence and data. Another important concept we should follow is risk sensitive land use planning. Nepal government has already prepared land use maps of all the 753 local units that give vital information about a particular place such as the soil, land capability, risk layer, present land use map, zoning map and cadastral layer. But some people have stopped the authorities from implementing the maps as once they are passed, a land categorised as an agricultural area cannot be converted into commercial land. If that scheme is implemented, one can’t build a house in high flood land. Now the local authorities enforce only the building codes and that don’t include these provisions. That doesn’t inquire whether a building is being built on a riverbank or a landslide susceptible area. In developed countries, those who build in high flood risk areas have to pay more in insurance. Also, areas are categorised based on the chances of occurrence of landslides on the basis of soil type, rock type, geology, distance from a drainage or a road etcetera and structures built there are dealt with accordingly. We are witnessing extreme weather events. In this context, what should we do to prevent more loss in the days ahead?We require an engineering paradigm shift in building infrastructures. The extreme weather patterns have made the data we used to refer to in the past while building infrastructures irrelevant. The data on water levels that were referred to while making a bridge in a river now need to be updated as water levels in our rivers have been rising in recent years. The existing infrastructures can’t withstand that volume of water. We witnessed record rainfalls last week. This can be a reference data for some years. Also, the sedimentation pattern has changed because of human settlements built upstream.Second, we have a generalised rule of building roads across the country. The impact of 200 millilitres of rainfall in Pokhara and rainfall of the same volume in Jhapa is different. As Pokhara experiences rains on a regular basis, the soil in the area can withstand it because it has been weathered by regular rain but the same volume of rainfall can cause more losses in Jhapa because of weak soil there. We thus have to consider the strength of soil while building a structure in a particular place.There is a single road construction method across the country, whether the place is in a high himalayan range, Mahabharat, Shivalik hills or plains. We have to make specific rules for specific places based on the geological and soil structures. The parameters of road construction should be redefined. We are improving the weather forecasting system but now we also need impact-based forecasting to inform the public not only about the volume of likely rainfall but also its likely impact.Where are the problems in our disaster response approach?The Natural Calamity (Relief) Act, 1982 was guided by a fatalistic approach as it saw natural hazards as destined by fate. Then came Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act, 2017. This change in law is in fact a paradigm shift in disaster management in Nepal. The new law’s perspective is progressive. The new Act changed us from response-centric to preparedness-centric. Legally, we are on a progressive path. But we lag in implementation. We also need to upgrade our skills in handling the situation. Our constitution as well as laws have entrusted local units with the responsibility of handling disaster incidents on their own. The government should make people at the local level aware, and equip and train them for the purpose.Training on some important procedures such as the INSARAG preparedness and response guidelines can be quite effective. Such training and other activities aimed at helping local units to handle disaster incidents should be conducted at the ward levels. “Understanding risk” is an important aspect in disaster management. So common people should be sensitised to the consequences of disaster incidents. You can see people collecting timber from flooded rivers, taking selfies on riverbanks and gathering on a bridge above a roaring river. People at all local wards need to be well-equipped. Those who were swept away at Nakkhu could have been saved if the security personnel and other people there had at least motorboats and life jackets. Our rescue workers now lack even such basic things.Settlements in Nepal’s mountainous and hill areas are located in equally risky zones. What should be done to safeguard them?The mountains in our region are taken as young and the Himalayan range is in the building process. It is also called an active mountain belt. Therefore, we experience frequent earthquakes. Earthquakes cause geomorphological changes. A large number of settlements in Nepal’s hills sit on the debris of old landslides that might have occurred long back. People there should be made aware of the risk and these places be identified. Engineering measures should be taken to make them safe. Scattered populations mainly in the highlands need to be integrated in concentrated settlements.What is the latest status of glaciers and glacial lakes in our mountains?The pace of glacial melting is rising alarmingly because of rising temperature. Earlier, we took only big glacial lakes as threats and gave them more attention but recent incidents showed that even smaller ones pose a threat. The incident of the Thame glacial lake outburst in August showed how the outburst of even a small glacial lake could have a cascading effect. Likewise, the deposits of landslides being piled above 3,000 metres are another serious challenge. Such sediment deposition is increasing in the mountains while there is a huge population downstream. The frequency of cascading hazards has increased, emerging as a major challenge. A landslide blocks a river and when the river breaches the structure built of debris, it causes devastating losses downstream.How can we scientifically prove that the hazards we are seeing were the result of climate change?There has to be scientific evidence to make the link. For instance, the Thame glacial outburst was clearly a climate change-induced hazard as it did not involve human activities. The treeline and snowline are shifting upwards in our mountains. There were no mosquitoes in Mustang until some years ago. Now mosquitos are widespread in the district as temperature there has significantly increased. The crop pattern has changed drastically. Thus we have a number of scientific evidence to show clear signs of climate change in this part of the world. What the government should now do is properly document these climate change-induced incidents following internationally-accepted methods and present them at relevant UN bodies. \nNepal’s economy that has been facing one after another setbacks since the 2015 earthquake has been struggling to bounce back. Last week, two international agencies—the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB)—announced that Nepal’s economy was poised to improve in the upcoming fiscal year. In this context, the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Nara Bahadur Thapa, former executive director of the research department of Nepal Rastra Bank, to discuss the current state of the national economy. The ADB, in its report last week, anticipated Nepal’s economy to grow by 4.9 percent this fiscal. A few days earlier, a visiting IMF team also painted an improving picture of Nepal’s economy. How do you see these projections?Nepal’s economic growth in the past 2-3 years has remained below 5 percent. But successive governments in their fiscal budgets have been setting the target of 6 to 7 percent growth. Also, the budget this year has aimed for 6 percent growth. In the meantime, two donor agencies have painted an improving picture of our economy. The ADB has anticipated 4.9 percent growth. Also, the IMF’s team that visited Nepal on a fact finding mission has projected better prospects. They expected better yield from the agriculture sector as Nepal is witnessing more rains. Last year, the growth of agriculture was 3 percent. Now they expect the sector may grow by 3.5 to 4 percent and that may lift overall growth. They have cited improvement in tourism and increased energy export as other bases. Based on these grounds, the ADB has projected 4.9 percent economic growth. But even the target of 5 percent growth looks ambitious if you analyse economic data available as of now and the steps taken by government agencies. We have witnessed more rain but that doesn’t always do us good. More rain in the late monsoon often damages paddy at the time of harvest. Second, the heavy monsoon has caused huge losses in our infrastructure such as roads and bridges that are vital to keep the daily lives and trade running. This may impact potential economic growth as some vital highways and roads have been badly damaged. These factors may pose a challenge in achieving the targets set by the government and donor agencies. Another important factor is that the ratio of capital formation to GDP [gross domestic product] is consistently decreasing. It was 33.8 in the fiscal year 2018-19, it decreased to 30.5 in 2019-20, to 29.3 in 2020-21, 29.0 in 2021-22, 25.1 in 2022-23 and 24.5 in 2023-24. How can we expect economic growth when capital formation keeps decreasing. We can’t achieve 6 percent growth without first improving the situation of capital formation. Capital formation in the private sector is on a decline and the government hasn’t been able to boost it. On the other hand, capital expenditure was lower in the past fiscal year in comparison to the previous fiscal. There is no strong sign of increasing capital formation even in the coming year. This is because the government has failed to collect revenue as per its own target. The revenue collection ratio is falling. It has come down to 18 percent of GDP, from 22 percent not so long ago. With this, the government’s funding capacity is continuously declining. It has failed even to fulfil its own duties. For instance, it hasn’t been able to pay health insurance bills and or the contractors. Similarly, credit offtake from private banks to the private sector has not increased from 6 percent. It used to be around 15-16 percent. Also, no substantive initiatives have been taken to improve productivity. For this, government agencies have to cut red tape. The private sector isn’t optimistic. We are talking a lot but not working seriously to lay a strong ground for growth.What are the signs that private investors are pessimistic?There is enough liquidity in the banks, and the interest rate is decreasing, but the private sector is not borrowing. Bankers say there is no demand from the sector. This indicates pessimism. None of the big business houses have launched any big projects in recent times. The government talks a lot about the energy sector but it is not doing power purchase agreements (PPAs) with hydropower project developers. We aren’t doing enough to realise the goal of exporting 10,000MW electricity to India. This shows no serious effort is being made to initiate reforms. The capital market has required some urgent reforms. But the government hasn’t appointed office bearers in the regulatory body for the past seven months. The government hasn’t given permission to issue IPOs and FPOs. Hence, the government is keeping two important sectors—energy and capital market—on hold. All these trends and activities suggest it will be a challenge to achieve even moderate economic growth.You pointed to the policy hurdles but the multilateral agencies have hailed the government for policy reforms. The IMF in its statement has welcomed recent amendments to various laws and the ADB has welcomed “the cautiously accommodative monetary policy”. Don’t these statements reflect reality?While making their positions public, the international agencies follow certain norms and criteria. First, they take macro pictures such as the government’s commitments. They take the pledges made by the government in the investment summit seriously. They think the commitments will be implemented. Second, they don’t want to irk the host country by presenting a bleak picture because they are diplomats. They point out possible pitfalls during bilateral and table talks but present themselves diplomatically while making their official statements public.Remittance, tourism and energy export are taken as major bases for economic growth but all three depend on external factors. How reliable can the projection be?Without trading and increasing exports, we can’t progress economically. We need to export to increase production and create jobs. Export is an engine of economic growth. Anyhow, we must increase exports. About your query, the government should tackle such things by strengthening relations with the countries concerned and devise policies and strategies accordingly.Our economy is increasingly dependent on remittance. How risky is it in the long run?Remittance has become a boon for our economy. It has played a tremendous role in poverty reduction. The first Nepal Living Standard Survey (NLSS) conducted by the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS)—now the National Statistics Office—in 1995-96 showed 42 percent Nepali population living below the poverty line. The latest [fourth] living standard survey has shown the poverty level at 20 percent. It wouldn’t be possible without remittance. Therefore, we can’t undermine the role of remittance in this social transformation. Were not the government’s plans and policies responsible for this achievement?The government role would not have been enough. What government policies have created jobs in Nepal? Are there any schemes worth mentioning? The industrialisation hasn’t increased. It is the industrial sector that creates jobs but the share of the manufacturing sector has come down to 4.87 percent in total GDP. Some years ago, it was nearly 9-10 percent. It shows our economy is being deindustrialised. How can we reduce poverty without providing jobs to the youths? Thus, foreign employment played a vital role in poverty reduction. Second is the role of remittance in maintaining foreign exchange reserves, which is essential to buy things from abroad. We have sufficient foreign exchange reserves because of remittance.Information Technology is now projected as a promising sector in creating jobs and transforming Nepal’s economy. How realistic is this expectation?Four fields can be taken as promising sectors in Nepal—agriculture, tourism, IT and hydropower. The IT sector certainly has a bright future. As our country is land-locked, we have additional challenges in merchandise exports and we can’t be competitive. The IT sector won’t have that barrier so it can be competitive in the international market. But for that the government has to formulate IT-friendly policies. For instance, if a Kathmandu-based Nepali firm wants to sell services in the US, Europe or any other international market, they need liaison offices in those countries. Otherwise, they can’t be competitive and grow. But the government doesn’t provide foreign exchange for them to expand their business abroad.Without this policy reform, Nepalis can’t compete with IT companies from other countries. Similarly, foreign companies need to come and work here so that Nepali youths can learn from them. Foreign banks came to Nepal and Nepali bankers learned. Now Nepali banks are doing good. But our policies aren’t favourable for foreigners interested in setting up IT firms. Also, well-trained IT workers are in shortage. We are progressing but we have to put in extra effort to make transformative changes in this sector.The cooperatives’ scam has emerged as a serious issue. What impact may it cause in the national economy if it’s not resolved soon?The cooperative sector played a vital role in creating financial inclusion in our economy by making 7.3 million people its members. Those who couldn’t do their regular transactions with banks were engaged with cooperatives. If that sector collapses, our state of financial inclusion will decline too. Second, they were major financiers for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME). Cooperatives are directly linked to entrepreneurship through MSMEs. They played a role in making interest rates of banks more competitive as well as banks and financial institutions were under pressure by the interest rates offered by cooperatives. Now they won’t feel the pressure.In this context, many people may resort to informal transactions. According to the 16th periodic plan, nearly 50 percent of Nepal’s economy is informal. We are under pressure to reduce the portion of the informal economy. But the crisis in the cooperative sector may increase the informal economy as those who were involved in cooperatives, which is a formal sector, are likely to do informal transactions with traders or other individuals.Cooperatives are not well regulated and there are anomalies but they are registered in a government agency, pay taxes, have offices and a record system. They brought people in far-flung villages under a formal channel. If the depositors resort to individual transactions, their money will be unsafe. The constitution accepted them as one of the three pillars—along with the government and the private sector—of the country’s economy. The sector expanded its network where there were no economic activities from the government and private sectors. For instance, the government was providing certain services such as distributing fertilisers, crop seeds, sugar through cooperatives. People will now be deprived of these services. Also, the commercial banks might face complications due to the domino effect of the cooperative scam. For instance, if the government seizes the land put up by a cooperative as a collateral in a bank and sells it to return the deposits, the bank might be in trouble.It is also said that cooperatives were becoming platforms for money laundering. How serious was the problem?Cooperatives didn’t seek a source of money from the depositors while accepting big deposits. They weren’t affiliated to the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of the central bank and the Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT). Therefore, there is a problem of money laundering. It can be resolved when they get affiliated with the FIU.What initiatives should be taken to address the problems seen in the cooperative sector?A powerful regulatory authority should be established without delay. The authority should work as a dedicated agency to clear the mess. Then, AML/CFT provisions should be implemented, a credit information centre should be set up and a debt recovery tribunal formed, and deposits guaranteed. The concept of self-regulation isn’t enough. These financial infrastructures are essential. \nOn Friday the weather is forecast to be partly cloudy in the hilly areas of Koshi, Bagmati, Gandaki and Karnali Province and partly cloudy to mainly fair in the rest of the country.Tonight the weather in the hilly areas of Koshi, Bagmati, Gandaki and Karnali Province is forecast to be partly cloudy while the rest of the country will remain mainly fair.The Meteorological Forecasting Division said the weather is influenced by westerly winds across the country, along with local winds affecting the hilly areas.On Thursday, Janakpur recorded the highest temperature at 31.5°C, while Jumla saw the lowest at -1°C.
