Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nRastriya Swatantra Party Chairman Rabi Lamichhane has denied having any role in handling the finances of the Gorkha Media Network as its managing director. Responding to over four dozen questions from lawmakers of the parliamentary committee investigating fraud involving various cooperatives, Lamichhane pointed the finger at Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai, then chairperson of the media network. To every question related to financial dealings, he answered he was not aware, according to the lawmakers who quizzed him. Lamichhane, former deputy prime minister and the minister for home affairs, was summoned by the parliamentary committee in the capacity of the executive director at the media network.“Lamichhane said it was GB Rai who oversaw the financial part including loans and other expenditures,” said Surya Thapa, chairperson of the parliamentary panel. “He claimed his role was limited to day-to-day administrative works and production and management of television programmes.”Lamichhane was invited to the 45th meeting of the committee whose tenure ends next week. Stating that he received a 15 percent share in the media network as sweat equity, he reiterated that he had not made any investment there. According to Sarita Bhusal, a member of the committee, Lamichhanec said he cannot be held responsible for the loans the media network received from the different cooperatives because it was Rai who managed the finances.“He claimed that there are no signatures, citizenship details or other official documents attached to the loan papers for releasing money from Suryadarshan, Supreme, Sahara or Swarnalaxmi cooperatives to the media network,” said Bhusal. Lamichhane has been making similar claims in public ever since he was linked to the cooperative scam.Starting at 4 in the afternoon, the question-answer with Lamichhane lasted almost six hours into the night. He shifted the blame to Rai for every question related to money. Prior to Lamichhane, the probe panel had quizzed Chhabilal Joshi, a founder of the news network. Both are accused of funnelling cooperative funds to the now defunct media company that operated Galaxy 4K television.On Sunday, the parliamentary committee recorded the statement of Bipin Acharya, deputy general secretary of the Lamichhane-led party. Acharya, who was creative director of the Gorkha Media Network, is also alleged to have been involved in embezzling funds from multiple cooperatives established under the leadership of Rai.Although Parliament had found that over Rs120 million was deposited to his account from different cooperatives, Acharya claimed he was unaware of it. The pattern of answers from Lamichhane and Archarya was strikingly similar, a member of the House committee said.The seven-strong House committee was formed on May 28 following demands from then-main opposition Nepali Congress. It was given three months to accomplish the task. Before Lamichhane, the probe panel had already interrogated 29 individuals involved in cooperatives frauds. It has already questioned Sudhir Basnet, who chaired Oriental Cooperatives; former lawmaker Ichchha Raj Tamang, who was the chair at Civil Cooperatives; and Krishna Bahadur Upreti, chair of Ideal Namuna Cooperatives, to its meetings and interrogated them on the issue. All of them are in custody.Additionally, police have summoned Kumar Ramtel, Bhabeshwar Aryal, Shiva Kumar Gurung, and Kalpana Shrestha of the Pokhara-based Suryadarshan Cooperatives for interrogation. They were brought from the custody in Pokhara to Kathmandu for the purpose.Om Prakash Gurung, chair of the Supreme Cooperatives, Butwal, was also brought to Kathmandu from Bhairahawa Prison.The committee also interrogated Dipesh Kumar Pun, the former secretary of the Supreme Cooperatives, Butwal. Pun is the son of former Vice President Nanda Bahadur Pun. The Thapa-led committee has the authority to investigate alleged scams in 29 credit cooperatives. Of them, 20 have been listed as crisis-ridden by the government while nine others are linked to the media network. Ideal Yamuna Multipurpose Cooperative, Image Saving and Credit Cooperative, Sahara Saving and Cooperative, Samanta Saving and Credit Cooperative and Sano Paila Saving and Credit Cooperative had allegedly injected money into the media network. The other four connected to the media network are Supreme Saving and Credit Cooperative, Suryadarshan Saving and Credit Cooperative, Sumeru Saving and Credit Cooperative, and Swarnalaxmi Saving and Credit Cooperative. The parliamentary committee has five days to wrap up its investigation. \nLast week, doctors at Thapathali-based Paropakar Maternity and Women’s Hospital diagnosed a new mother in her late 20s with postnatal depression. Her newborn baby was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit of the hospital due to health complications, and the mother was under care in the maternity ward.“We had to start her on anti-depressants, as she was showing serious symptoms, including suicidal thoughts,” said Dr Pratikshya Ghimire, a psychiatrist at the hospital. “She felt sad all the time, worried about the newborn's future, and had lost her appetite.” Mental health problems during pregnancy are the second leading cause of maternal deaths, after excessive bleeding during childbirth, also known as postpartum haemorrhage, and pre-eclampsia [pregnancy-related high blood pressure disorders. A report on maternal mortality unveiled last year by the National Statistics Office showed that six percent of maternal deaths were due to self-harm (suicide), with most cases occurring during pregnancy.To address mental health problems during pregnancy, the Ministry of Health and Population has started outpatient care services at the Maternity Hospital.“We have not only started outpatient care but also begun screening inpatients for mental health conditions,” said Dr Ghimire. “We have diagnosed around a dozen and a half patients with serious mental health problems.”According to Dr Ghimire, the woman had an inter-caste marriage, and neither her in-laws nor her own parents accepted her marriage, contributing to her mental health struggles. Several other pregnant women and new mothers have also been found suffering from mental health problems, each at various stages of severity.“The Health Ministry had deputed one psychiatric doctor to our hospital, and we started offering outpatient services after her arrival,” said Dr Shree Prasad Adhikari, the hospital's director. “We are also working on training all hospital staff in mental health screening so that conditions can be diagnosed early. Once mental health problems are identified, patients can be referred to specialists.”Officials hope that screening pregnant women for mental health problems and providing prompt treatment will help reduce maternal deaths, which have been rising alarmingly of late.Doctors say prenatal and postnatal depression can occur at any time during pregnancy or after childbirth. Shifts in hormone levels during pregnancy and after childbirth can significantly affect mood. Many women feel anxious about changes happening to their bodies. Some may even have financial concerns and some worry about taking on new and additional responsibilities.Some women experience extreme sadness, anxiety, fatigue, and changes in sleeping and eating habits during pregnancy or after childbirth. Experts warn that prenatal and postnatal depression along with anxiety and other mental health issues, can lead some women to take their own lives.They also emphasise that excessive bleeding after childbirth, also known as postpartum haemorrhage, pre-eclampsia (pregnancy-related high blood pressure disorders), and suicide are preventable. “Timely screening for mental health problems and proper counselling can significantly reduce the mental health problems faced by pregnant women and new mothers,” said Adhikari. “We have launched this initiative at our hospital, and this is something other hospitals should also implement.”Nepal reduced the maternal mortality rate from 539 per 100,000 births in 1996 to 239 per 100,000 births in 2016. For this, the country also received a Millennium Development Goals award. The 2021 census report showed that in every 100,000 live births, 151 women died from maternity-related complications. According to the report, 88 maternal deaths were prevented in every 100,000 live births between 2016 and 2021. Nepal’s target under the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals is to reduce the maternal mortality rate to 75 per 100,000 births by 2030. \nForeign Minister Arzu Rana, who returned on Thursday after completing a five-day official visit to India, has said that New Delhi’s response to the new government in Nepal was positive.“Based on my discussion with Indian leaders and officials, India’s response and reaction to the new government constituted by two major political parties [in Nepal] was positive and good,” Rana said, briefing the party’s ongoing central working committee meeting on Friday on her interactions in New Delhi.Rana paid an official visit to India from August 18 to 22, during which she called on Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and held bilateral talks with her Indian counterpart, S Jaishankar. She also met with other leaders and officials during her stay and regular health checkups in New Delhi.“We were curious about India’s response to the formation of the new government in Nepal,” she told the Nepali Congress committee. “Let me inform you that India’s response and reaction were good and positive.”About her meeting with Indian Prime Minister Modi, she said, “I met with Modi ji, who said India viewed the new government [in Nepal] as a positive development. I handed the invitation from our prime minister to Modi ji.” Rana also briefed her party on the recent arrivals of delegations from China and the United States of America. Deputy Secretary of State for Management and Resources Richard Verma paid a two-day visit to Kathmandu last week, announcing an additional $100 million in US military aid to Nepal, subject to Congressional approval and the availability of funds.The foreign minister said the US side communicated that it would provide two more helicopters and two struts to the Nepal Army, which will be used for disaster response. Similarly from China, Yang Weiqun, vice-chairman of the China International Development Cooperation Agency (CIDCA), is on a Nepal visit. He met Rana on Friday.“Both Modi ji and Jaishankar ji assured me about India’s continued support for Nepal’s development endeavours,” Rana said on Friday, adding that her India visit was successful for several reasons. “During my meetings with Indian leaders, I communicated to them that Nepal’s peace process is headed in the positive direction with the parties agreeing on transitional justice law amendments, which is a positive outcome achieved after the formation of the new government.”Rana said that Nepal and India had discussed several matters related to mutual interest and agreed to activate bilateral mechanisms. Soon, there will be a meeting of the Joint Commission on inundation and flood control.“We received a letter from the Indian side on Friday,” Rana told the meeting. “My visit played a pivotal role in building trust between the two sides.”“During my meeting with Modi ji and Jaishankar ji, I expressed Nepal’s concerns and interests. The visit has opened the line of communication at the highest level and at different levels to provide future direction for our cooperation and partnership,” according to a statement issued by Rana’s private secretariat.“During my meeting with Minister Jaishankar, we discussed issues such as energy cooperation, trade and transit, connectivity, investment, air routes, infrastructure development, floods and inundations, the Pancheshwar Multipurpose Project, sports, and infrastructure in the bordering areas,” she said. “To address several issues between Nepal and India, we also agreed to activate bilateral mechanisms.” Rana also briefed the party on her meeting with Yang, the vice-chairman of CIDCA, China’s external aid agency. The Chinese official looking after China’s external aid regime wants to know Nepal’s position on the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).Nepal and China signed the BRI framework agreement in 2017, but not a single project has been executed under it so far. The Chinese side unilaterally announced some projects under the BRI framework, but the government of Nepal has yet to recognise them.A Congress leader said Rana had explained her party's position on BRI during her meeting with the CIDCA vice-chairman, but she did not mention the government's position on BRI.The government has not discussed much about the BRI and its funding modality in Nepal. “Rana told Yang that our party has a clear position on BRI that we cannot afford a loan, so our preference would be grants, and if needed to take the loan, we will go for a soft loan equal to the interest rate of the World Bank, Asian Development Bank or any other global lender.” On Thursday, four different letters of exchange were signed between Nepal and China to carry out the four projects which will be built with Chinese grants.Four different letters were exchanged to upgrade the 8.2-kilometre Kalanki-Maharajgunj Ring Road, build an Integrated Check Post (ICP) and an Inland Container Depot (ICD) at Korala in Mustang, and conduct a feasibility study for repairing and maintaining the Araniko Highway. \nIndia and Bhutan progressed into the semi-finals of the SAFF U-20 Championship from Group B after the Blue Tigers defeated the Maldives 1-0 in their final group match at the ANFA Complex in Satdobato on Friday.Manglenthang Kipgen scored in the fifth minute of the stoppage time for India.The outcome means, India topped Group B with six points and will face Group A runners-up Bangladesh in the semi-finals.Bhutan, on three points, qualified as group runners-up. The Maldives exited the competition after two straight losses.Bhutan’s semi-final opponents will be hosts Nepal, who won Group A after defeating both their opponents Bangladesh and Sri Lanka in the group stage.The Maldives were in a must win situation following their 2-1 loss against Bhutan but could not really threaten India, who needed only a draw, throughout the game. Maldives goalkeeper Mohamed Yaameen was perhaps the busiest on the pitch, keeping the frequent Indian attack at bay and making up for defending mistakes.But India, too, were not at their best and wasteful on many occasions.India should have taken the lead early when Maldives defender Mohamed Aiham Anwar’s poor attempt to clear a cross from Korou Singh Thingu fell in the path of Monirul Molla, who only needed to tap but failed to capitalise on the opportunity.India had another clear chance in the 22nd minute. Thingu was the creator again as he sprinted towards the opposition half, cut inside and set up for Molla but Maldives goalie Yaameen came to the rescue with a quick reflex save.The Maldives built up some pressure after the break but could never trouble the Indian goalkeeper Priyansh Dubey.India came close to goal in the 78th minute when Mohamed Aiham Anwar and Ahmed Nawaf Fauzy failed to clear a cross from Ricky Meetei Haobam but Yameen kept the Maldives breathing with his quick thinking.It was all India in the final minutes and Yaameen had to come to rescue for defending mistakes twice.But the goalie was finally undone by Kipgen, whose low shot from outside the area managed to sneak into the bottom corner despite a full-stretch effort from Yaameen. \nNepali TikTok users will need to wait a few days more to use the social media app despite the government lifting the ban. On Thursday, the government lifted the TikTok ban after nine months.“TikTok will resume once the company formally applies for company registration and starts working on the conditions set by the Nepal government,” said Gajendra Thakur, spokesperson for the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology.“A meeting was held on Friday at the ministry with the TikTok vice president. The TikTok delegation has committed to accept all the government conditions,” said Thakur.“We have received the Cabinet’s decision. We will now write to the Nepal Telecommunications Authority to allow TikTok after the company completes all the government-mandated processes.”Only the authority can allow the resumption of service, according to directions from the communication ministry. The service providers need to wait for the authority’s notice for service to resume on their networks.Pradip Paudyal, deputy director of the Nepal Telecommunications Authority, the telecom regulator, said they have yet to receive the ministry’s letter.The government has given ByteDance, TikTok’s parent company, a three-month deadline to comply with certain terms and conditions.Responding to the government's decision to lift the ban, TikTok issued a statement on Friday saying the government had opened the door for economic opportunity for creators and would support enabling Nepali voices and creativity.“We're pleased that TikTok has been unblocked in Nepal. We appreciate the government of Nepal's commitment to ongoing productive dialogue and recognise their care for the Nepali community's digital experience, \" TikTok stated.“The creativity and passion of our community have brought joy to households across Nepal and opened vital economic opportunities to incredibly talented creators and businesses. We're excited to be able to continue enabling Nepali voices and creativity as we work to support the success story of Nepal.”On November 13, then-prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government banned TikTok, citing its adverse effects on social harmony.However, the KP Sharma Oli administration allowed TikTok to operate with several regulatory changes.According to the conditions, TikTok, from now onwards, has to help promote Nepal's tourism, invest in digital literacy efforts, support and uplift Nepal's public education system and filter content on its platform.Earlier, TikTok sent several letters to the Nepal government requesting the ban be lifted.In the letter, TikTok said that the ban was causing financial losses to the company and the country.The government restricted TikTok after introducing the ‘Directives on the Operation of Social Networking 2023’ in November last year.The directives made it mandatory for social media sites such as Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), TikTok, and YouTube to open liaison offices in Nepal.The government said the measure was introduced because an increasing number of people complained that the absence of the companies’ representatives in Nepal made it difficult for the authorities to address their users’ concerns and even remove objectionable content from the platforms.Internet service providers said that TikTok accounts for nearly 40 percent of internet bandwidth consumption in Nepal. When it is banned, internet consumption does not decline as users switch to virtual private networks (VPN).Before the ban, there were around 2.2 million TikTok users in Nepal. \nOur roads are becoming increasingly unsafe due to poor and haphazard construction, natural disasters. But more often than not, it is because our drivers are overworked, and there is hardly any solid monitoring mechanism in place to check their physical and mental status. Providing resting time for drivers becomes even more crucial during monsoons, when landslides obstruct roads and the journeys become longer.Realising the need to provide drivers with resting time and place, the Lumbini Province Government started building five “smart refresh centres” in Bardaghat in Nawalparasi West, Sainamaina in Rupandehi, Chandrauta in Kapilvastu, Lamahi in Dang, and Bardiya along the East-West Highway four years ago. These centres promise washrooms, eateries, restrooms, shower rooms, charging stations, parking area, among other amenities, to help drivers and passengers tackle fatigue during long-distance travels. However, due to budget constraints, the project hasn’t seen the light of day yet. While the idea of starting the refresh centres is laudable, there is a clear lack of coordination among political parties to complete the project. The ambitious project took shape in Lumbini during the CPN-UML government when it set aside around Rs110 million. But the government was ousted even as it began construction work, and the new government, led by the Maiosts, slashed the budget for the project. The project got shelved by subsequent governments. Even though the first phase of the project (only the construction of the building) has been completed in Sainamaina, its operation has been halted as it lacks proper guidelines for functioning. The experiment in Lumbini has been a failed project.Nepal’s Motor Vehicle and Transport Management Act mandates drivers to rest after six hours of driving. However, the authorities have failed to enforce the rules, let alone arrange proper rest areas for the drivers. Safer roads not only improve road safety but also help the country's tourism flourish. As we strive to expand our tourism agenda by attracting more tourists, the importance of ensuring basic resting facilities along the highways cannot be overstated. Providing the best services for tourists will attract them to the country, thereby boosting our economy and buttressing international reputation. While it is encouraging that several other provinces have rest centres along highways, the conditions are far from decent. Most of these centres lack basic sanitary and hygiene services. Moreover, such small projects lack sufficient construction as well as maintenance funds, as has been the case in Lumbini. The governments’ tendency to consider them “trivial” is equally concerning. Such a mindset not only hinders our journey towards making roads safer but also other opportunities that come along with it, including tourism promotion and passenger satisfaction. As highway accidents become a regular phenomenon in Nepal, we need more smart refresh centres. The federal government should therefore come on board and help provincial and local governments construct these centres through enough budget allocation on need basis. It is also necessary to devise a plan to maintain and renovate existing ones that lack enough amenities for drivers and passengers. Meanwhile, political parties should heed the projects that are in the best interests of people, and not weigh them on the basis of whether they fall under their party’s priority or not. \nDemocracy can be both vulnerable and endurable. Vulnerability arises from governance crises, elites’ incompatibility with basic democratic rule, and all kinds of human frailties developed by rulers’ irrational behaviours and myopic decisions. Commonly, resistance to misrule and elected leaders’ absurdities create conditions for systemic and extra-systemic changes or revolutions. The crisis of legitimacy in all its manifestations works against the longevity of governments. Apart from the electoral legitimacy that helps form a government, psychological legitimacy, a part of performance legitimacy, makes situations more fertile for mass rebellion.Small incidents or faulty decisions the leaders make prepare grounds for major upheavals. Bangladesh’s latest event shows how a government elected a few months ago could face the wrath of students and people. They revolted against the Sheikh Hasina government’s decision to implement the 30 percent reservation quota for the children of liberation fighters—Muktibahinini, perceived as the Awami League Party members.Legitimacy crisisPolitical awareness has both positive and negative sides. A ruler’s positive picture provides governmental stability, whereas an egregious picture fuels instability. Popular consciousness holds governments accountable. Any democratic government that ignores widespread sensitivity and rights loses its moral ground. Thomas Hill Green, a political philosopher, writes, “Human consciousness postulates liberty, liberty involves rights, rights demand the state”. According to him, the state is organic to the elements of consciousness and rights, and the state must “hinder the hindrances” that come in the way of liberty. John Locke, much before Green, gave people the right to revolt if the government failed to be legitimate and responsible for protecting their rights. Thus, democracy is as attractive a concept and practice as it is impregnated with seeds of movement. Holding periodic elections, along with the design of power separation, is for controlling disruption or breakdown of government or even the political system. Elections, too, demand people’s consciousness because they are expected to circulate elites to provide a safety valve for the system. If different methods and excuses plunder the elections, the scope for extreme actions becomes inevitable. Many instances in South Asia, Latin America and Africa have proved that legitimacy claimed on the grounds of electoral victory alone is weird, as people rise to revolt sooner or later if leaders fail to be sensitive. A few days ago, the Colombian president was forced to resign when his legitimacy grounds became suspect. Democracy contains the sparkle of fire that needs to be carefully handled. Movements are violent and non-violent, and their methods vary depending on their very nature. Democracy produced by violent upheavals is short-lived, as it is fraught with uncertain elements and is not conducive to the smooth functioning of a political system. Moreover, in countries where rulers and systems are organic to each other—arguing that one is exclusive to the other—the fall of rulers would also be the fall of the regime. In Nepal, the monarchy was identified with the regime's endurance created by the king. When people revolted against the regime, the monarchy became weak despite the king’s confidence that his grip on power would not dwindle, even when the people rejected the Panchayat system. As King Gyanendra failed to fathom the anger and resentment of people against his authoritarian proclivities, both the monarchy and the regime collapsed.South Asian democratic crisesIn Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, people involved in the movement seemed to be sensitive to the cause of democracy. In addition to rooting out the system, they also didn’t allow the army to wield power after the ouster of leaders Sheikh Hasina and Gotabaya Rajapaksha. They soon displayed their maturity in realising the need for communal harmony and peace despite the vandalisation of Hindu temples and houses of minority communities in Bangladesh. The choice of a scholar, Professor Muhammad Yunus, in spite of his animosity with Hasina, augured well from a democratic point of view. Bangladesh, like Sri Lanka, is expected to return to electoral politics and maintain constitutional order soon. However, the agitators and other parties must learn a lesson: Winning elections by foul means would be dangerous. Hasina’s greatest failure was to concentrate power in her own hands, depriving her political rivals of the fight for election. She used draconian methods to decimate opposition. Her decent track record of faster economic development, making Bangladesh a development model for South Asia, has been overshadowed by her authoritarian governance style. Nevertheless, Hasina’s party is likely to continue to be a significant force because of its long history and tradition, which gave birth to the Republic of Bangladesh. South Asian countries, in general, have demonstrated that any form of authoritarian dictatorship is not a substitute for democracy. The military in Pakistan might have continued to play politics from behind; there, too, the civilian’s share of power is not absent. However, it is assumed that in any system, democratic or authoritarian, the military, which is one of the core elements of national security, shows its influence in politics. Although the elected government is supreme in India, it has to consult the army while making vital security decisions. In South Asia, democracy suffers from parties and politicians whose minimum moral standards are blurred, causing them to be highly self-centred and parochial in running the system. In Nepal, bad image projections of leaders are fraught with the danger of being overturned by quick events, as in the past. People easily link external factors with political upheavals in countries of the region. However, the governance crisis and negative image of leaders seem crucial for electoral defeats or government toppling. Hasina’s allegation that the US was behind the movement against her is untenable, despite her not-too-friendly relationship with the country. Her view that the US wanted to use St Martin’s Island and the Bay of Bengal for security purposes lacks veracity and cannot be the sole reason for her ouster. It is a truism that rulers generally try to find fault with foreigners when they are under pressure at home or are overthrown by popular movements.  \nThe incident occurred on August 9, 2024, hours after crowds in India and Pakistan cheered on their respective contenders for the javelin gold in Paris. Just like in most places in the subcontinent, on the night of August 8, on-duty doctors at the RG Kar Hospital in Kolkata in India were also watching Arshad Nadeem and Niraj Chopra compete against each other. A lot was at stake and India was the favourite. We all know what happened in the competition, as Pakistan won its first individual Olympic gold medal.However, nobody, it seems, knows what happened at the RG Kar Hospital. It has been two weeks since the news broke that a trainee doctor who was on duty that night was brutally raped and killed in the early hours of August 9. Ever since then, Kolkata and many other Indian cities have been in a state of turmoil. Out-Patient Department services have been suspended in several hospitals in the country and questions are being raised about how such a brutal crime could have taken place in a fully staffed hospital.According to news reports, the second-year resident was completing a 36-hour shift at the hospital and was attacked while she was apparently resting in a seminar room. The doctor’s parents were not called until much later. They were first informed in a telephone call that their daughter was very sick. They were later told that their daughter had died by suicide. When the shocked and panicked parents arrived at the hospital, they were prevented from seeing their daughter’s body for four hours.When finally they were allowed to see their child’s body, they saw that she had been beaten and badly bruised. The glass from her spectacles had been smashed on her face and even her eyes were bleeding from the shards. The postmortem report, that hinted at gang-rape, was horrifying, and said that the victim had been strangled to death. Suspecting a move to destroy evidence, the father of the rape victim questioned the haste with which the body of his child was cremated.The incident is brutal and horrifying and it brings to the fore a safety problem that has also been faced by working women in Pakistan. Doctors, including women doctors, work long hours in very difficult circumstances—whether they are at the understaffed wards at government hospitals in the cities or in far-flung areas where amenities are few and living conditions difficult.Doctors, including those with labour-room responsibilities, have to work at all hours of the day and night and may be singlehandedly responsible for dozens of patients at the same time. The situation is made more complicated by the fact that patients are often accompanied by entire crews of family members. If something goes awry or the patient passes away, one doctor is left to face a crowd of angry family members. While such a situation can be faced by both male and female doctors, the latter category is more vulnerable in a patriarchal society, where misogyny and gender discrimination are par for the course.Medical premises in Pakistan are often not equipped with safe and adequate facilities for female doctors whether these are bathrooms or rooms where female medical staff working long hours can rest safely. This means that women doctors, who are already a target of aggression in the wards, are unable to feel safe even outside them.In the Kolkata case, the person who has been arrested was a civilian police volunteer, who appears to have had easy access to all parts of the hospital. The same conditions apply to many hospitals in Pakistan where people have easy access to all parts of medical premises, thus posing a potential threat to women doctors and nurses.It is understandable why the medical community in India is on the streets protesting against the rape and the conditions that led to it. Unsurprisingly, as time passes, the matter is being given a political colour because the ruling Modi administration—which has done nothing to make working conditions safe for women in the country—wants to undermine the state government in West Bengal whose capital Kolkata is. However, the issue is not one of politics or the government’s ineptitude but rather a wider culture of patriarchal violence in the entire subcontinent. The fact is that women are routinely targeted, raped and forgotten in all of South Asia. Men commit these crimes because they know that most of the time they will get away with it; in fact, there will be no consequences whatsoever.One ridiculous solution that someone offered in the Kolkata case is that women doctors should not be permitted to do night duty at all. This solution seeks to further punish women who have already been held back for centuries for a variety of flawed reasons, including the belief that allowing them independence would compromise their safety vis-à-vis men with uncontrollable bestial instincts.If women anywhere in South Asia are to be safe, this kind of thinking needs to go. The root of the problem—men with depraved thoughts and capable of expressing these in the most horrific way—has to be addressed. The young doctor in Kolkata was saving lives in an under-resourced environment and at an hour where only medics can save you. For this, she suffered in the most despicable way.The brutality and the horror reveal just how inhuman South Asia has become, with men who commit such crimes and men who ignore their occurrence in the workplace and their homes. If there is any hope, it is in the women who are marching to demand their very basic right of being able to do their job without facing threats of rape, violence and death.-Dawn (Pakistan)/ANN \nThe energy sector remained one of Nepal’s most vibrant sectors for over a year. Some encouraging news brightened the country’s mood even as the overall economy remained stagnant. In June last year, Nepal and India inked a long-term power trade agreement, whereby the southern neighbour would import 10,000 MW of hydroelectricity from Nepal in 10 years. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi made the announcement at a joint press meet with Nepali counterpart Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who was on a visit to India. Based on the same deal, India has been gradually increasing the quantum of energy it is importing from Nepal. On Monday, New Delhi approved a plan to import an additional 251 MW of electricity from Nepal, increasing the total imports to nearly 1,000 MW. Nepal, which was heavily dependent on India’s electricity until a few years ago, became a net exporter of electricity last fiscal. Encouraged by the potential market in India and other neighbouring countries including Bangladesh, investors have been injecting huge investments in this sector. Work to build transmission lines and substations has picked up in recent months. Nepal and Bangladesh were all set to sign an agreement last month on the export of Nepal’s 40 MW of electricity via India, only to be cancelled due to political unrest in the South Asian nation. Even as Nepal makes great strides in electricity production and exports, our villages still remain unelectrified. According to the Nepal Electricity Authority’s latest report, 18 of the country’s 753 local government units are not connected to the national grid. According to the NEA report published on Tuesday, 1 percent of the total population is still deprived of the basic facility. Even in the rest of the parts of the country covered by the national grid, electricity supply is still erratic. Moreover, while the import of electric vehicles (EVs) is rising, exhibiting a keen interest among Nepalis to switch from fossil fuel to electricity, the government doesn’t seem to be keeping pace. While it is yet to build the infrastructure for electric vehicles, including charging stations, its policy on import and sales of such vehicles isn’t consistent. Another important area where the government should concentrate its efforts on is increasing the consumption of electricity in the kitchens of Nepalis across the country. The ministry of energy should devise some attractive schemes to replace cooking gas with electric stoves. Authorities don’t seem to be seriously working on these fronts. Instead, the government at times looks derailed. At a time when it needs to expedite work to replace fossil fuel-based activities with electricity, the government is preparing to build oil pipeline connecting Siliguri of India to Charali in Jhapa, a greenfield tank terminal in Charali, and an extension of the pipeline from Amlekhgunj to Lothar in Chitwan with India’s support.Promoting electricity and fossil fuel usage at the same time, the government seems to be trying to have it both ways. This approach is wrong approach. What the government should do is to formulate a clear policy of promoting clean energy-based activities and formulate a comprehensive plan on energy production and consumption. That should be guided by the approach of increasing domestic consumption and exporting surplus production. This strategy has multiple benefits. Replacement of the huge quantity of imported fossil fuels with electricity saves billions of rupees, helps rejuvenate the country’s economy and decarbonises the transport and other sectors. \nThe weather on Saturday is expected to be partly to generally cloudy across the country. Light to moderate rain, accompanied by thunder and lightning, is likely in several areas of all provinces, according to the Meteorological Forecasting Division.For tonight, the forecast predicts partly to generally cloudy skies throughout the country. Light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is likely in some areas of Koshi, Bagmati, Gandaki, and Sudurpaschim provinces, with a few showers possible in other provinces as well.On Friday, the highest temperature was recorded at 34.8°C in Dhangadhi, while Jomsom saw the lowest at 15.0°C. Simara experienced the heaviest rainfall in the past 24 hours, recording 130.0 mm. \nThe shopkeeper asked if I was a police officer or worked for the Nepal police when I went to purchase the book ‘Bepatta Sipahi’. His question surprised me, so I asked why he thought that. He mentioned that many police officers often ask for this book, so he assumed I might be one of them.This made me wonder what was in the book that prompted such a question. I knew it was the sequel to ‘Sipahi Ko Diary’, a book about war and soldiers. But later, I understood why the police were particularly interested in it.The decade-long civil war in Nepal is often said to have set the country back by 100 years. Beyond the physical devastation, it took thousands of innocent lives and shattered countless families. Similarly, the Kedarnath flood on June 16, 2013, also claimed thousands of lives. While these two events might seem unrelated, they are deeply interconnected in ‘Bepatta Sipahi’. These two incidents shape the narrative, plot, and characters.‘Bepatta Sipahi’ is a story of pain, death, and destruction brought by war, affecting both soldiers and their families. Just as life seems to stabilise, more suffering is introduced by the Kedarnath flood. The book revolves around Tej Bahadur Raut, a missing soldier who served in the Nepal Army during the civil war. Through his first-person perspective, the story vividly portrays the horrors of war—the deaths of comrades, the mass graves, and the blood-soaked battlegrounds shared by both soldiers and Maoist fighters. It highlights the tragic reality of Nepali citizens forced to fight against those they once considered brothers and sisters, all due to political turmoil.In ‘Sipahi Ko Diary’, the writer narrates the experiences and struggles of the soldier Shiva Chhetri. In ‘Bepatta Sipahi’, the focus shifts to his fellow soldier, Tej Bahadur Raut, who went missing during the war. During a visit to Kedarnath with his cousin-brother, Shiva comes across Tej's diary. The story unfolds through this diary, where Tej recounts various war incidents, his family troubles, the horrors of battle, and the circumstances leading to his disappearance. Shiva is portrayed as a brave soldier, often leading his team to victories against the Maoists and earning praise from his superiors and peers. However, after a significant incident, his life takes a dramatic turn, opening up a new chapter in the story.The connection between Tej's journey from the civil war to the Kedarnath flood is captivating, keeping readers on edge and eager to find out what happens next. The story is filled with twists, making it difficult to predict the plot. This book blends elements of thriller, suspense, romance, and more, capturing the rollercoaster of Tej's life as he navigates through unforeseen challenges and finds himself in situations he never imagined. The unpredictable turns in his life echo the book's line, \"Manchey le socheko pugdaina vanchan. Tara sochyo vane pugcha,\" meaning, \"People say just expecting, or thinking is not enough. But it is enough.\" The story reflects that while life is full of surprises, expecting the unexpected is no surprise.Katuwal's ‘Bepatta Sipahi’ spans different periods, from the civil war to the Kedarnath flood, with time shifting as the author narrates various events. The book also includes a fragment from the diary of Tej's sister, Niru, a Maoist soldier. Mentioned in Tej's diary, Niru’s account provides insight into the perspective of a Maoist soldier. It reveals why she joined the Maoists and became a soldier, even if it meant opposing her family and turning her brother into an enemy. The book portrays the shared terror of war through her story, where soldiers on both sides are tragically forced to fight against each other.The war scenes in ‘Bepatta Sipahi’ are depicted with striking detail, capturing every nuance of the experience. The emotions involved—firing at the enemy, having brief conversations with comrades, or witnessing their deaths—are conveyed, allowing readers to fully immerse themselves in the story.The writer incorporates multiple languages in the book, including Nepali, Hindi, and English, adding depth and authenticity to the narrative.The book provides a detailed portrayal of the civil war, vividly illustrating the conditions people and villages face. It captures the horror of war through the eyes of a soldier, highlighting the uncertainty of their lives and the government's shortcomings in protecting them. The character often voices frustration over the government's neglect of soldiers' safety.While ‘Bepatta Sipahi’ focuses on Tej's life, the array of characters and shifting settings—from the battlefield to Kedarnath—can initially be confusing. The story may seem disjointed initially, but the connections between the characters and events become clearer as readers progress. However, the book has some literary shortcomings, such as using specialised military terminology that might be challenging for some readers.Although ‘Bepatta Sipahi’ is a sequel to ‘Sipahi Ko Diary’, it stands alone and can be understood without reading the first book. While ‘Sipahi Ko Diary’ recounts the author's experiences as a soldier, ‘Bepatta Sipahi’ shifts focus to the story of a fellow soldier and his search for him, drawing on the author's real-life experiences.Bepatta SipahiAuthor: Chandra KatuwalYear: 2022Publisher: Bhundipuran PrakashanPages: 216 \nIn a bid to monitor the nutrition status of the population, the Ministry of Health and Population is planning to carry out a nutrition assessment survey in all districts throughout the country in the ongoing fiscal year.Officials said the nutrition status of pregnant women, children under five, adolescents, and new mothers will be monitored during the survey.“We will first assess the nutrition condition of the people of specific age groups and then share the findings with relevant agencies, including the Ministry of Health and Population,” said Lila Bikram Thapa, chief of the Nutrition Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “The nutrition assessment survey is crucial for getting the latest picture of the nutrition status of the population.”Malnutrition is a silent crisis in Nepal. The country has made significant progress in reducing stunting among children under five. According to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022 report, stunting decreased from 57 percent in 2001 to 25 percent in 2022.Wasting, a debilitating disease that causes muscle and fat tissues to waste away among children under five, decreased from 11 percent in 2001 to eight percent in 2022.Wasting or low weight for one’s height in children, if not treated properly and on time, is associated with a higher mortality risk, according to the World Health Organisation.Even though the health survey report showed some improvement in the country’s overall nutrition status, progress is not the same in all provinces. More than 16 percent of the children under five years in Lumbini Province are found to be suffering from wasting—the most immediate, visible, and life-threatening form of malnutrition.Likewise, around 10 percent of children under the age of five years in Madhesh Province have been found suffering from wasting.Officials said the new study was required to determine the latest progress on the population's nutrition conditions.“The nutrition status of the adolescent population will be monitored by schools, while health facilities will monitor children, pregnant women, and new mothers,” said Thapa. “Health workers will also take classes in schools to educate students about the importance of good nutrition and counsel pregnant women and new mothers at health facilities.”Along with the lack of sufficient nutrient foods, poor sanitation and lack of safe drinking water and treatment are blamed for wasting.Doctors say malnutrition during pregnancy increases the risk of complications and maternal and neonatal deaths, as well as the likelihood of low birth weight. It is a major impediment to growth, affecting human capital and economic productivity of a country.Experts say nutrition is directly linked to the country's overall development. Malnutrition affects children's physical and mental growth, which ultimately affects the country’s economic health.It weakens intellectual capacity, limits productivity in adulthood, and increases vulnerability to certain diseases.Nutritionists ask authorities to promote locally available foods, educate people about the importance of a nutritious diet, and provide fortified flour to improve nutritional conditions and reduce dependency on freely distributed foods.Nepal also has an international obligation to improve the condition of malnourished children.To meet the SDG targets, the country needs to reduce stunting to 15 percent from the current 32 percent by 2030, wasting to four percent from the current eight percent, underweight condition to 10 percent from the existing 19 percent, and anaemia to 10 percent from more than 43 percent at present.The SDGs, a follow-up on the Millennium Development Goals, (MDGs), aim to end poverty, hunger, and all forms of inequality worldwide by 2030, and Nepal has committed to meeting the goals. \nCricketer Gulsan Jha, football player Preeti Rai, volleyball player Kabita Bhatta, kabbadi’s Manmati Bista and Rugby’s Shree Ram Shrestha have been nominated for the peoples’ choice award for the annual Pulsar Sports Award, which is scheduled to be held on September 13.Organiser Nepal Sports Journalist Forum (NSJF) unveiled the five nominees for the peoples’ choice award amid a function in Kathmandu on Friday. The nominations for the peoples’ choice category is done based on their achievements and popularity in their respective sports discipline in the last few years. The winner of the people’s choice award will be decided through eSewa votes, Facebook likes and points given by NSJF members and chief coaches of national sports associations affiliated with Nepal Olympic Committee. The eSewa votes will have 50 percent weightage, Facebook likes carry 25 percent and the points given by coaches and NSJF members will carry 12.5 percent weightage each.“All the nominees of the peoples’ choice award are outstanding in their game. For us, they all are the winners,” said NSJF General Secretary Prajwal Oli, who is also coordinator of the players selection committee.NSJF renewed its deal with its voting partner eSewa on the occasion. NSJF President Subedi and eSewa Chief Business Officer Ashish Gautam exchanged the Memorandum of Understanding. It’s the fifth consecutive year NSJF joined hands with eSewa.Last week, NSJF extended the sponsorship deal with its main sponsor Golchha Group for a 16th edition in a row. Golchha Group is the holding company of Hansaraj Hulaschand and Company, which is an authorised distributor and producer of Bajaj Pulsar motorbikes in Nepal.NSJF is recognising athletes and sports professionals in ten categories—Male Player of the Year, Female Player of the Year, Coach of the Year, Youth Player of the Year, Team of the Year, People's Choice Award, Lifetime Achievement Award, Para Athlete Honour, Special Award, and the Asian Sports Journalist Award—this year.The winner of the peoples’ choice award will receive a Pulsar NS 400 two-wheeler, while Male Player of the Year, Female Player of the Year, Youth Player of the Year, Coach of the Year will be awarded with Pulsar NS 200.The winners of the Team of the Year Award, Lifetime Achievement Award, Special Award, and Para Athlete Honour will be awarded Rs100,000 each.The winners of other five categories will be revealed during the award ceremony.“The nominees for the player of the year male, female, youth, coach will be announced in a few days,” said NSJF Secretary Anjan Khadka.National cricket team member Jha had an important role in guiding Nepal to ACC Men’s Premier Cup trophy and their maiden Asia Cup in India. His unbeaten 67 (84) had guided Nepal to a seven-wicket victory against the United Arab Emirates in the Premier Cup final. Jha was also an important part of the Nepal squad at ICC U-19 World Cup and T20 World Cup. Footballer Rai has established herself as one of the most important players of the national women’s football team. Her stoppage time goal against Lebanon guided Nepal to the final of the WAFF Women’s Championship last year.Manmati Bista was a part of the Nepal national women’s kabaddi team who won a bronze medal at the 19th Asian Games in Hangzhou, China.Volleyball player Bhatta is a regular at the national team. She was in the squad that secured a silver medal at the CAVA Women’s Volleyball Nations League this month.Rugby’s Shrestha led Bagmati Province to the championship during the National Games. He also represented Nepal in the rugby competition at the 19th Asian Games. \nMadhesh United, one of the six franchise teams of the inaugural edition of the Everest Women’s Volleyball League, have signed Tunisian player Yosrah Zeramdini.It is the second foreign signing of Madhesh after also recruiting Yevginiya Kalinova of Kazakhstan earlier this week.“We are very excited to have signed Yoshrah Zeramdini. We believe that Zeramdini’s arrival will strengthen Madhesh’s blocking,” the club said in a statement on Friday.Middle blocker Zeramdini is a member of Tunisia’s national team. The 23-year-old, who is 184 cm tall, will also carry experience of the Russian league to Madhesh United.“I have heard about Nepal many times. I am very excited about my upcoming journey …..to play in a beautiful country with Madhesh United,” Zeramdini said.Madhesh’s other squad members include Niruta Thagunna, Puja Tharu, Sangam Mahat, Jasana Mahato, Shanti Tamang, Hira KC, Aashika Chhetri and Alisha Manandhar. Bharat Yadav will coach them in the league.All six teams have already announced their eight-member squad and respective coaches but Madhesh are the first team to announce foreign player.Gandaki, Kathmandu, Madhesh, Lalitpur, Karnali and Chitwan are competing in the tournament. \nAn avalanche in ward 2 of Thasang Rural Municipality, Mustang, has blocked the Boksikhola, a tributary of the Kaligandaki River.Deputy Superintendent of Police Bhoj Raj Pandey, chief of the District Police Office, Mustang, said the avalanche from the Dhaulagiri Icefall blocked the river near Gurusangwe Cave, just downstream from the river’s source. The avalanche has obstructed around 80 percent of the river’s flow.Somal Hirachan, vice-chair of the rural municipality, told the Post that while there is no immediate risk by the flood, residents of five to seven houses have been relocated to safer ground. He warned, however, of the potential for a flash flood downstream if the lake formed by the avalanche bursts. \nAnother Olympic Games has come and gone and Nepal’s quest to bring home an official Olympic medal continues to seem like a pipe dream.Nepal sent seven athletes to the 2024 Summer Games in Paris to compete in six different sports but none of them will have anything to show for back home—no athlete from Nepal has won a single official medal in the country’s 60-year Olympic history.But, is it at all realistic to expect an Olympic medal from Nepali athletes?“Winning a medal at the Olympics is not impossible. But our investment and preparation for the Olympics and other international events are woefully inadequate,” said former Olympican Deepak Bista, who currently serves as the president of Nepal Olympians Association and the director of national team preparation, at the National Sports Council. “There are no proper venues for players to train and practice, So how do you compete against elite athletes from around the world?” Athlete Santoshi Shrestha completed the difficult 41.195km track of the women’s marathon event in the 79th position out of 91 athletes. Her timing of 2 hours 55 minutes and 06 seconds was far from her previous best and national record of 2 hours 46 minutes and 23 seconds, which she set on the way to marathon debut gold at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Dhaka Marathon earlier this year.After the women’s marathon, Santoshi said she could have set a new national record in Paris had she pushed herself more in an endurance-testing track, but she chose not to because of fear of possible injury.“I could not take the risk because the track was very steep after 15 km. I was comfortable and could have made a new record there [in Paris] but I chose to stay in the comfort zone. I want to compete in other tournaments as well,” said Santoshi.But Santoshi’s story could have been different had her preparations and training back home been better. “Further, players, coaches and team management all need to work hard with complete focus and dedication all round the year if they are to bring medals. Sadly, the state of our players is not good enough. They are compelled to find other jobs so that they can look after their families. How can we expect them to win medals at big tournaments?” added Bista, who was the second Nepali athlete to qualify for the Olympics, Beijing 2008.“The players need physical, mental and financial support.”Former Nepali Olympian Sangina Baidya also points to poor investment and preparation in sports for Nepal’s underperformance at the Olympics.“There is a lack of extensive investment in sports infrastructures. The state should be interested in the development of sports. If there is sufficient investment at the youth level, and they get substantial funding, resources and infractures, they can undoubtedly perform better in the international competitions including the Olympics,” said taekwondo practitioner Baidya, who was the first Nepali athlete to qualify for the Olympics, in Athens 2004, through a selection tournament.“In comparison to other successful countries, here in Nepal, preparations for the Olympics start late. They get only a few months of training, which is not enough,” she added.Judoka Manita Shrestha Pradhan has a similar story. She got a training room only two months before the Olympics and she was still expected to win at least one or two bouts in Paris—which is a lot to ask for. Shrestha Pradhan could not progress beyond the first round of women’s 57 kg weight category event.There is no targeted budget for the Olympics programme despite the sports sector getting Rs3.5 billion for the fiscal year 2024/25. Only Rs9 million was allocated for the transport, lodging and food of athletes and officials participating in the Paris Olympics and Paralympics.The Nepal Olympic Committee provides $750 per person to the 10 athletes of the 10 sports under the International Olympic Committee’s Solidarity scholarship, which is insufficient. Swimmers Alexander Shah and Duana Lama trained abroad, in the United States and Thailand, respectively, but the scholarship amount was not enough for them to train at top-class facilities. Lama finished last in her Heat and 30th overall in women’s 200m freestyle.Shah, who was competing at the Olympics for a second consecutive time, will at least return home with some joy. His 51.91 seconds in the men’s 100m freestyle Heat shattered his own previous national record of 52.17 seconds set during the World Aquatic Championship in Doha, Qatar.Badminton star Prince Dahal trained in Sri Lanka and had to travel to Paris 2024 without a coach as Nepali authorities did not send the name of the coach for accreditation and visa process on time.Prince Dahal could not win a single match in the men’s singles group stage. Shooter Sushmita Nepal finished 42nd in the women’s 10m air rifle qualification event. Table tennis player Santoo Shrestha also exited the Olympics from the men’s singles preliminary round.But big investment in sports may not always do the trick.Santoo Shrestha, who competed in the men’s singles table tennis at Paris Olympics, was the only third player in Nepal’s Olympic history to qualify for the Olympics through the selection stage—which is a perfect demonstration of how poor the country is technically.Take Jamaica and Kenya. Athletes in these countries are highly successful in athletics.Jamaica—the home of sprinter Usian Bolt, eight time Olympic gold medallist and world record holder in the 100 metres, 200 metres, and 4 × 100 metres relay—has won a total of 87 medals at the Olympics. Of them 86 have come from track and field.Kenya is the most successful African country at the Olympics, with a total of 124 medals so far. Of them 117 are from track and field and seven from boxing.Ethiopia is another nation which focuses on long-distance events. Their total of 58 Olympic medals have all come in long-distance events in athletics.India was once a dominant country in field hockey and won a record 11 Olympic medals, including eight golds between 1928 and 1980. Although the country experienced a drought in hockey medals, the sport is gradually finding new success after its team picked two consecutive hockey bronze medals in Tokyo 2020 and Paris 2024. Wrestling and shooting are the other sports Indian athletes specialise in.“The government should learn from how other countries prepare their athletes,” said Bista, suggesting that Nepal should target some sports for the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles and prepare accordingly.Nepal has won a total of 26 medals at the Asian Games. Of them, it has bagged 24 medals in martial arts, which include karate (4), taekwondo (14) and boxing (6). “Nepal should select sports in which Nepal is historically good, for instance martial arts. After that, the government should allocate a significant budget just for the Olympics programme and train the players from the beginning if it expects our athletes to do better,” Bista added.Technically, Nepal’s only medal at the Olympics came in 1988 in Seoul when Bidhan Lama won a bronze medal in the men’s 50kg weight category taekwondo competition. But his medal was counted as unofficial as the sport was then an exhibition event. Taekwondo entered the Olympics programme only at Sydney 2000.But the 2026 Asian Games in Aichi-Nagoya, Japan could be a head start.The National Sports Council has launched Mission 2026 as part of the preparations for the next Asiad and has targeted at least 10 medals. But, sadly, the government has only approved Rs20 million for the programme.“We don’t have enough funding for the programme. This amount will support our athletes for only five to six months. It is unfortunate that the government could not embrace the NSC’s mission.” Bista said, adding that he fears Mission 2026 will just be an ambitious dream.But Bista hopes Palesha Goverdhan may change history despite the odds. Goverdhan became the first Nepali paralympian to pass the selection stage when she qualified for the Paris Paralympics. She won a gold medal in the Asian Qualifiers in China.Govardhan also won a bronze at the 2022 Asian Para Games, becoming the first Nepali para athlete to win a medal at the event.“Palesha is training in London under one of the best trainers,” said Bista who added that the NSC is paying her training fees. \nThe Rastriya Swatantra Party, claiming to be \"cadre-less,\" emerged as Nepal's fourth-largest party in 2022, but is now considering forming grassroots party committees despite its initial anti-cadre stance.\nBangladesh's political crisis mirrors Nepal's history of autocratic rule, highlighting India's role in emboldening undemocratic tendencies, raising concerns about its foreign policy in South Asia.\nChinese drones will be used in Nepal to clear garbage from Mt.

This shift is vividly captured in Muna Bhadel's artistic practice, whose paintings reflect her grandmother’s life and the broader implications for women in Nepal.Early marriages and familial responsibilities profoundly influenced many older female generations, including Bhadel’s grandmother. Bhadel’s artistic practice delves into her grandmother's life experiences and dreams, offering personal insight into the generational differences between older women and their younger counterparts.With her exhibition, ‘Silent Whispers’, which opened at Siddhartha Art Gallery on August 19, she hopes that young Nepali women who view her work can relate to and connect to her experiences.Bhadel shared that her grandmother was eight years old when she married her husband, who was 13. This left her grandmother with many unfulfilled dreams and repressed desires, which her granddaughter has had the chance to pursue. Her artwork, supported by an Australian Himalayan Foundation Art Award, seeks to bring this generational divide to light in a way that resonates with contemporary Nepali women.Bhadel’s recent work consists of large acrylic paintings featuring elderly Nepali women, often based on her grandmother. These paintings are distinctive due to her use of two different painting styles, which signify the separation between her grandmother and her dreams. While her grandmother is depicted in a hyper-realistic style, the rest of the scenes are in a pictorial style inspired by old Nepali and Indian Mughal/Rajput miniature paintings.In addition, the artist intentionally chooses the colours and patterns worn by the women in her paintings, adding another dimension to the meanings behind her paintings. Traditionally, clothing changes depending on a woman’s marital status, meaning that clothing can signify what stage of life a woman is in. For example, as the artist explained, when a woman is married, she usually wears red, but when she is widowed, she must wear white. In most of her paintings, her colour palette is predominantly red. One of her paintings particularly stood out to me. It features her grandmother looking downwards, longingly, out of a traditional Nepali window frame. To her right are three vertical scenes of lovers, reminiscent of a Patachitra narrative scroll.The first scene features Krishna attending to Radha’s hair, the second is a man bowing to his lover, and the third is two lovers sharing a meaningful conversation. Bhadel described these scenes as the love and intimacy that her grandmother wished she had felt from her husband and the life she wished she had had the opportunity to pursue.The painting evokes a strong sense of grief, grief over a life that never happened and experiences that were taken away before Bhadel’s grandmother was old enough to make her own decisions.In an interview, Bhadel reflected on how, just two generations later, she has experienced many freedoms that her grandmother had not—falling in love and pursuing her artistic career.The artist’s work not only honours her grandmother's journey but also serves as a broader commentary on the societal constraints that have historically limited women’s opportunities in Nepal.Early marriages restrict young girls from pursuing their education and realising their full potential. Child marriage was officially made illegal in Nepal in 1963, and the nation has one of the highest legal ages for marriage at 20 years old (or 18 with parental consent). Unfortunately, statistics reveal a mixed picture: while there has been progress in reducing child marriage rates, substantial barriers remain, particularly in rural areas where the law is harder to implement.Various women’s rights activist groups have pushed for stricter laws on child marriage and more focus on women’s education, resulting in the Nepal Government endorsing a National Strategy to End Child Marriage in Nepal by 2030 in 2016.This governmental promise is incredibly important, as a lack of autonomy over one’s body restricts freedoms in nearly every aspect of life. According to a UN study conducted in Nepal in 2016, only 47.7 percent of women aged 15-49 said that they make their own decisions regarding sexual relations, contraceptive use, and reproductive healthcare.In partial correlation with the dropping child marriage rates, girls’ access to education has greatly increased, which is another major contributor to the generational divide that Bhadel has experienced.A study conducted in 2018 by UNESCO showed that the literacy rate of women aged 15-24 was 90.88 percent, while the literacy rate of all women ages 15+ was only 59.72 percent. This reveals a huge difference in the number of women in the new generation who have had access to schooling and have the opportunity to pursue their dreams beyond building a family. Her paintings vividly depict the unrealised dreams of women who have navigated the complexities of familial responsibilities. The contrast between realistic portrayals and imaginative Mughal-style scenes underscores the tension between personal aspirations and societal expectations. These artworks testify to the resilience and untold stories of women whose voices are often marginalised.Through her art, Bhadel emphasises the importance of understanding and learning from the older female generation’s experiences rather than simply highlighting feminist struggles. Her art memorialises personal histories rather than advocating for an avenue for societal change.With her paintings, she hopes to foster a deeper understanding among her audience, particularly younger women grappling with similar societal pressures. Bhadel’s relationship with her grandmother reflects a broader societal phenomenon, so she hopes that when Nepali women see her artworks, they can reflect on their own experiences with their female relatives’ generation gap.‘Silent Whispers’Where: Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal Revisited, KathmanduTimings: 11:00 am to 5:00 pm, On Saturday: 12:00 pm to 5:00 pmTill September 18Irwin is a Cypriot undergraduate student studying anthropology alongside visual arts at Princeton University. \nKul Chandra Gautam's international diplomacy career and literary pursuits were shaped by his passion for reading and his three self-authored books reflect his views on Nepal's political economy, personal journey, and global perspectives.\nRajen Kandel, founder and chief executive officer of The British Education Group (BEG), which includes The British College (TBC), has been awarded ‘MD of the Year’ in the SME News IT Awards 2024.

According to the Nepal Police Headquarters, rain-triggered landslides and floods have injured 247 other individuals since the monsoon began on June 10.Gandaki Province recorded the highest number of deaths at 56, followed by Bagmati Province at 39. Lumbini Province saw 37 fatalities, Koshi 27, Sudurpaschim 15, Karnali 13, and Madhesh Province 8. Among those killed in Bagmati, three were from Kathmandu Valley.The disasters also resulted in 247 injuries, with the highest number reported in Karnali Province (59). As many as 47 people were injured in Gandaki Province, 38 in Koshi, and 38 in Bagmati (including 11 in Kathmandu Valley).A total of 34 people were injured in Sudurpaschim Province, 19 in Lumbini, and 12 in Madhesh. Also, 49 people went missing, and the disasters displaced at least 5,883 families, police said.Among the missing, 41 are from Bagmati Province, followed by two each from Koshi and Gandaki provinces, and one each from Madhesh, Lumbini, Karnali, and Sudurpaschim provinces. \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli has said that efforts are being made to incite people in the name of disenchantment towards the political parties.Responding to questions from lawmakers during a House of Representatives meeting on Thursday, Prime Minister Oli said that those who do not like healthy competition between the political parties or those who are dissatisfied with the current political system are trying to stir up people against the political parties and create political unrest.There have been efforts to make people more dissatisfied with the political system than they actually are, Prime Minister Oli said.Addressing Parliament before Oli, Nepali Congress lawmaker Narayan Khadka had warned the government to be cautious about the use of social media.“The current government is trying to instill hope in the people by taking everything into consideration,” Prime Minister Oli said in reply. “Positive results have started to appear in the short period of time since the formation of the government in my leadership and the current government has no excuse not to work. The government will work seriously to instill hope in the people.”At least three lawmakers raised questions about constitutional amendment to the Prime Minister. While answering their questions, Prime Minister Oli said that constitutional amendment is not a matter of courage. “We will amend the constitution taking into account the experience of eight years of its implementation,” Oli said.Meanwhile, lawmaker Narayani Sharma asked whether the current government formed with the objective of amending the constitution dares to revise the constitutional provision related to the electoral system and introduce the provision of a directly elected executive head.“Amendment of the constitution is not a matter of courage,” Oli said. “The government won’t dare to amend the constitutional provision that does not need revision, but where it is needed, the government will not hesitate to show the courage.”Likewise, Pashupati Shamsher Rana of Rastriya Prajantra Party also asked which of the articles of the constitution was the present coalition government of Nepali Congress and CPN-UML vying to amend.“There is no definite article that the present government is aiming to amend as of now,” Oli answered. “It would be determined during the amendment process and it will be done based on the discussion with the lawmakers.”Congress lawmaker Khadka had also put forth his queries related to constitution amendment.The coalition government led by Oli was formed after the seven-point agreement between Nepali Congress and CPN-UML on July 1. With the agreement between two of the largest parties in the country, the Pushpa Kamal Dahal government, formed in support of UML on March 4, was unseated from the position on July 12.One of the objectives the two parties came together to form the government is to amend the constitution, leaders have said.During the quizz with the prime minister, CPN (Maoist Centre) lawmaker Purna Bahadur Gharti Magar raised the issue related to the State Partnership Program (SPP) and the recent visit of US Deputy Secretary of State Management and Resources Richard R Verma to Nepal.Verma was on a two-day visit to Nepal, starting on August 16. Beside vowing to continue US support to Nepal in various sectors, Verma also informed the prime minister that the US intends to support $100 million in foreign military finance to support Nepal’s rotary wing capabilities.“During the meeting with Verma, we discussed the multifaceted relations between two countries,” Oli said. “Verma said that the US will provide two helicopters to the Nepal Army. No issue related to SPP was discussed.”Oli also claimed that most of the tasks relating to power trade with Bangladesh have already been concluded and there was a plan last month to sign the pact in the presence of the energy ministers of Nepal, India and Bangladesh.The scheduled event was cancelled due to political unrest in Bangladesh.The then Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled the country on August 5 and Nobel laureate Mohammad Yunus became the interim prime minister of the country on August 8.While answering the question of Congress lawmaker NP Saud, Prime Minister Oli noted that the agreement, which has been six years in the making since the energy cooperation between Nepal and Bangladesh was established, remained a top priority for the Nepali government.“Given the recent developments in Bangladesh and the formation of an interim government there, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Energy, Water Resources, and Irrigation of Nepal are working to finalise the agreement as soon as possible,” Oli said.Prime Minister Oli underscored the importance of the agreement, saying that it will mark a significant milestone in sub-regional energy cooperation in South Asia, as it will be the first time Nepal exports electricity to Bangladesh.Moreover, Prime Minister Oli presented details as to how the government is working on a long-term plan to export 10,000 megawatts of electricity to India over the next decade. \nThe Nepali Congress statute says that six months after the party's general convention, it should elect the heads of various party departments along with its members. The Congress held its 14th general convention in Kathmandu in December 2021. Almost two and a half years after the party's general convention, Sher Bahadur Deuba, the party president, appointed the heads of 37 departments on August 5. Deuba also appointed 17 department heads last year. The party has yet to name 16 heads, including those of organisational, foreign affairs, and public relations departments. The Congress must hold its next general convention by the end of 2025, as per the party statute. However, it can be deferred by a few months citing special reasons. If the party is to hold its general convention on time, that should be done within over a year from now. But the party has also not appointed some office-bearers, let alone the departmental heads and its members, Congress leaders say.The treasurer remains to be appointed. The largest party in the House of Representatives has 70 departments. During last year's central committee meeting, the party increased its department count from 48 to 70. Though the party president appointed the various department heads, the leadership still needs to finalise the members of those departments. The party statute provides for each department to appoint 51 members. According to the party leader, the department head has the right to appoint ten members, whereas the party president appoints the rest, as per the statute. Govinda Pokharel, the head of the Economic Policy and Planning department, says the upcoming central committee meeting will appoint members of various departments. The party's prorogued central committee meeting will resume on Friday. The party central committee meeting commenced on August 7. After the five-day meeting, it was postponed for ten days, arguing that the party leaders needed to give time in Parliament and the parliamentary committee.“The party department could have shown the result by now had it been formed in time,” Pokharel told the Post. “But, if we look at the history of Congress, no president in the recent past has formalised the party department in time. Deuba is no exception.”Before Deuba, Sushil Koirala and Girija Prasad Koirala were the party presidents, and Pokharel added that both leaders failed to make the party department vibrant during their time.Arjun Narasingha KC, who has worked in various positions in the party, effectively under Girija Prasad's Koirala, partially agrees with Pokharel. “Forming the party department and making them vibrant was not a problem during Girija Prasad Koiral’s tenure. However, during Sushil Koirala and Deuba’s tenures, it became a major problem,” KC told the Post.“Forming the party department should not have been a problem for the president, but why are they hesitant? I just can’t say,” KC said.The party's statute mentions that the party president is responsible for appointing the department head and its members. However, the party leaders say that when other leaders, especially a senior one, show interest, the appointment gets delayed. “Various party departments are the organisational tools for the leaders to exercise power within the party,” Pokharel added. “If the leaders can install their favourite as the department head, it can amplify their strength within the party. Many of the party's senior leaders are interested in selecting the department heads and their members.”Last year, during the party's central committee meeting, which increased the number of departments, General Secretary Gagan Thapa had formalised a calendar of party activities. It mentioned appointing the department heads within two months. However, the party failed to follow the calendar passed by the central committee meeting. Thapa’s proposal was a good initiative but it failed in implementation, KC told the Post. As time passed, Deuba appointed some department heads. But can the departments formed late work effectively? For Pokharel, it depends on the leadership of the department. “But, chances to perform well will be slim.” “The lack of discipline in Congress, as seen lately, and the weakness in building party organisation are some of the reasons for not having effective party departments,” Pokharel argued. “Had our departments been functional, our local leaders and cadres would have known the party's thought process through various departmental programmes.” He adds that the party needs working departments.But political analyst Geja Sharma Wagle has a different take. Congress follows the traditional system of party operation. As long as the party is run in a traditional way, Wagle says, whether it forms the departments or not won’t matter.“The only way to make the Congress functional is to change its system,” Wagle told the Post. “The Congress should have a directly elected party president, in a departure from the traditional system, to make the party functional.” \nWhen the political parties in the House of Representatives appear divided over the idea of amending the constitution, vaguely floated by the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, the Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal (JSP-Nepal), has said it would welcome it provided the party’s demands are addressed.KP Sharma Oli became prime minister based on a July 1 agreement reached between the Congress and the UML. In the same deal, the two largest parties also agreed to take turns to head the government and amend the constitution, purportedly to ensure political stability, among other things. “The national consensus government will prioritise reviewing the strengths, weaknesses, and complications observed in implementing the constitution and will focus on amending the constitution and enacting related laws to ensure political stability,” Prime Minister Oli stated in Parliament on July 21, during his floor test. Some parties, including the CPN (Maoist Centre), the third largest party in the House of Representatives, have raised serious concerns about the intentions behind the proposed amendments, accusing the big parties of attempting to revoke some progressive features of the statute. Maoist Centre chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal was ousted from the position of prime minister on July 12 after the two largest parties joined hands to form a government. The Rastriya Swatantra Party, the fourth largest in the lower house, has also questioned the motives behind the Congress-UML deal. The JSP-Nepal, however, is comparatively more open to the idea of revising the constitution. The party has demanded that its certain concerns must be addressed should there be any amendments to the statute. The party has called for the formation of a constitutional review commission comprised of experts to propose amendments. The party’s central committee meeting held from August 11 to 14 decided to support amendments based on the recommendations of an elite commission. The party has also demanded amending the constitution to place local units under the provincial government. Likewise, it has demanded a directly elected executive head, a fully proportional election system, a federal justice system with proportional and inclusive representation, and self-governance based on national and ethnic identity. Yadav, who led a different political party, had submitted these proposals in the Constituent Assembly while drafting the statute as well.“The names of provinces should reflect their identities,” mentions the decision of the party’s central committee meeting.Many of JSP-Nepal’s demands related to amendments echo Yadav’s previous positions. Although the party had compromised on its demands during the constitution-making process for consensus, it is now advocating for a directly elected executive head, among other things. “Most of our current demands are the same ones that we had registered during the constitution-drafting process,” Prakash Adhikari, a party leader and a federal lawmaker from the party, told the Post. “If the two major parties address our demands, we are open to revising the constitution.”But Chandrakishore, a political analyst from Madhesh, finds the JSP-Nepal’s demands as irrelevant. Except for the directly elected executive head, the issues the party now has raised are old ones, he told the Post.“The party’s latest demands are the issues of the Madhesh Movement, but Yadav then chose to align with the ruling parties and betrayed the movement,” Chandrakishore told the Post. “Now he is again raising the same old issues in an attempt to placate the Madheshi people.” “If JSP-Nepal wants to truly engage with the people, it needs a leadership overhaul. Repeating past demands won’t work.” Despite lending support to Prime Minister Oli during the trust vote, the party was not accommodated in the Cabinet, while its splinter faction, the Janata Samajbadi Party holds a key portfolio in the Oli government. After Ashok Rai, then federal chair of the party, along with six lawmakers, split the party on May 5 to form the Janata Samajbadi Party, the JSP-Nepal’s strength in the House has diminished markedly.The party concluded its general convention in June unanimously electing Yadav as party chair. Even after over two months of the convention, the party is still to elect its office bearers, though it has formed a central executive council. A party’s central committee meeting last week demanded that the parliamentary and provincial constituencies be redrawn based on the latest census. Likewise, the party has also called for proportional representation in the National Assembly. Similarly, the party also vows to dissolve District Coordination Committees, arguing they are redundant under the federal structure.  \nBarely a month after exiting from the government, the CPN (Maoist Centre), the third-largest party in the House of Representatives, has faced a power struggle between party chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Deputy General Secretary Janardan Sharma.The conflict between a wartime Maoist commander Sharma and his “supreme leader” Dahal, which had been simmering for quite a while, surfaced at the party’s standing committee meeting that concluded on Thursday.Sharma not only spoke against Dahal but also presented a written document to the standing committee. At the meeting, Sharma asked Dahal to step down as party chairman. Dahal has led the party uninterruptedly for over three-and-a-half decades.At the end of the standing committee meeting, leaders had said that the differences between Dahal and Sharma were resolved. But that conclusion seems premature. The two were busy accusing and criticising each other at a public function in Kathmandu. Dahal had to pacify Sharma on Saturday as he complained of not being trusted by Dahal and other Maoist leaders. “When I was assigned to build an alliance with the CPN-UML, I worked for the same but was tagged as KP Oli’s man,” Sharma said at the function. Later, the Maoist Centre decided to ally with the Nepali Congress, and he worked for the same as directed by Dahal, Sharma claimed. “But I was dubbed Sher Bahadur Deuba’s man. When will I be called the Maoist party’s man? When will you call me Prachanda’s man?” said Sharma, pointing to Dahal, who was sitting at the same podium as the chief guest.Taken aback, Dahal seemed to be consoling Sharma saying that comrade Prabhakar [Sharma] would never split the party, contrary to some media reports.Dahal rubbished reports that Sharma was trying to split the party as baseless and that the days-long standing committee meeting had dispelled all rumours.The Maoist party chief and former prime minister, however, admitted that there were still some confusions and that the meeting had decided to look into the matter and make things clear and resolve them with joint effort.Soon after the party was out of the government, it called the meetings of the standing committee and the secretariat and discussed the Maoist CEntre's future course, including unity with other fringe parties, strengthening the Socialist Front, and building the party’s organisation.“There were some matters of serious suspicion and some still exist. And the meeting has decided to study and find how such a situation of suspicion emerged,” Dahal said. The Maoist leader promised to study the issue jointly with Sharma and, if needed, the party may form a probe committee.“We have reached an understanding to properly address the remaining concerns as well,” Dahal added.Sharma is not alone in demanding that Dahal handover the party’s reins.Even Maoist Centre senior vice-chair Narayan Kaji Shrestha has asked Dahal to quit the leadership position. A large number of Maoist leaders at the central as well as lower committees want to see an overhaul of the party, said a central member.“If we fail to transform the party, there will be no hope for us besides surrendering to other parties in the 2027 elections,” the leader said.Another central committee member however doesn’t trust Dahal to build the party organisation. “Dahal would rather forge unity with other left parties and, if possible, explore options to contest the upcoming elections jointly with CPN-UML, the country’s largest communist party,” said the central member.The leader said he was unsure if the ruling UML would turn down Dahal’s proposal to join hands once again. According to him, Dahal’s strategy is to bring together left-leaning parties and put pressure on the UML, which leads the government with the backing of the Nepali Congress, to make an electoral alliance with the Maoists. The leader argues that the UML is preparing itself internally to contest the elections on its own, without allying with anyone.“This is the beginning of an infighting in the Maoist Centre because we abandoned the agenda of strengthening the federal, republican and secular Nepal,” said Ram Karki, secretary of the Maoist Centre. “This tussle is unlikely to stop anytime soon.”Because the conflict emerged under Dahal’s ‘schooling’, Karki claimed.He recalled that Mohan Baidya, who supported Dahal’s school of thought, engaged in a similar tussle before leaving the party. That conflict did not subside but intensified, leading Baidya to finally split the party, Karki observed.Later, Baburam Bhattarai, who also emerged allegedly from Dahal’s schooling, led a similar revolt, Karki recalled. “He also deserted the party. This time, too, the tussle has surfaced among those schooled under Dahal, so no one knows the outcome,” said Karki.For decades, Sharma remained a close confidant of Dahal. But he grew up to be a dissident after Dahal refused to appoint him the general secretary last year. Another deputy general secretary, Barsha Man Pun, was also an aspirant for the post of general secretary.Sharma and Pun are taken as Dahal’s lieutenants, right from the launch of the Maoist insurgency in 1996. Sidelining both during the 2022 party general convention, Dahal picked Dev Gurung, who had little influence in the party.Karki described the Congress-UML alliance’s move to oust the Maoist Centre from the government as a good opportunity to strengthen the Maoist party.“If the Nepali Congress and the UML hadn’t ejected our party from the government, we would have been finished by the time of next elections,” said Karki. “As we have been removed from power three years ahead of the election, there is some room for transformation.”Senior party leaders have given Dahal two options: transform himself and the party or vacate the chair that he has been occupying for over 35 years.Another central committee member said that if the conflict was an internal matter and the fight genuine, the party would emerge unscathed. “Otherwise, if external factors are working within the party, then the party will face a serious crisis,” said the leader.However, some Maoist leaders are confident that the party will not face a grave crisis. “Janardan ji questioned the party leadership. Isn’t that a good practice in the party?” said Yubaraj Chaulagain, a central committee member. “However, Chairman Dahal is addressing them.”Chaulagain said that the party leadership would collect reports from the party’s provincial committees and sister organisations and take the right decision based on them. “There’s the proposal for the party’s transformation. It will be discussed. We will gather more feedback and ideas from the lower committees, and follow them,” said Chaulagain. “Gradually, we will address the issues raised by Janardan ji.” \nCPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who has been leading the party for over three-and-a-half decades, has yet again pacified the leaders who want him to hand over the leadership.Janardan Sharma and Barsha Man Pun—deputy general secretaries of the Maoist party—had demanded that Dahal hand over the party leadership to a leader of their generation. The two leaders raised the issue during the standing committee meeting that commenced on August 9.Leaders concluded the meeting on Thursday as they decided to strengthen the Maoist party through internal dialogue between the leaders on their disagreements.Party secretary Ram Karki said that responding to the questions raised during the standing committee meeting on August 10, party chair Dahal vowed to address their issues.The party will resolve the theoretical as well as ideological differences among the party leaders through dialogue, Karki told the Post, quoting Dahal.On August 9, the first day of the meeting, the Maoist chair presented a verbal proposal on current political affairs, party building, and other pertinent issues.After Dahal’s presentation, some leaders raised questions about the party’s policies and leadership. Among them, Janardan Sharma, a deputy general secretary, submitted a written proposal on August 10, calling for a review of Dahal’s leadership and suggesting that the party chair be limited to a ceremonial role as patron.In his document, Sharma alleged, among other things, that the party leadership was trying to use state power against him.In the 14-page document submitted to the meeting, Sharma accused the party leadership of ‘spreading disinformation’ about him and the other deputy general secretary, Pun. He also accused the top leaders of even misusing state power against him.“The fake information about the party split, which was generated from Khumaltar [the private residence of Dahal], spread widely after reaching Baluwatar [the prime minister’s official residence where Dahal was staying until last month when the government changed],” Sharma questions the party leadership in his document. “There are questions: why did the leadership disseminate fake information?”However, Maoist Centre leaders said the issue has been settled, for now, after Dahal pledged to resolve it through intra-party discussions.Party chair Dahal, while speaking to the press briefly after the conclusion of the standing committee meeting on Thursday, said the reports and rumours about party split were baseless.“Rumours related to the party split led by comrade Prabhakar [Janardan Sharma] are baseless,” Dahal told journalists.The meeting also decided to hold consultative meetings at the provincial level, where the party's office bearers will also participate. After the meeting, the party will call for a full-fledged meeting of the central committee in mid-September (Ashoj first week).Another party secretary, Devendra Paudel, said the upcoming central committee meeting will call the party's special general convention, as decided during the eigth general convention held in 2022.But Lilamani Pokharel, a party secretary, says no decision was taken with regard to convening a special general convention as only the central committee has a mandate to call a special general convention, the supreme body of a party that can take final decisions on the party’s policies and leadership.“The party will go for a special general convention only if a central committee meeting decides to go for that,” Pokharel told the Post.After the party was out of the government in mid-July, calls for Dahal to relinquish the top position have grown. Haribol Gajurel, a close aide of Dahal and deputy general secretary, also raised the issue of leadership change during a meeting of party officials before the standing committee meeting and demanded a special congress to address the issues.Gajurel proposed that all office-bearers should resign and make a fresh start to rejuvenate the party. He even submitted his own resignation as a starting point. Following this, on the second day of the standing committee meeting held on August 10, Deputy General Secretary Sharma questioned the central leadership in his political paper.However, party spokesperson Agni Sapkota, who is close to Dahal, argued that the questions raised by Sharma were aimed at strengthening the party. “The issue I raised during the standing committee meeting was for the betterment of the party and to strengthen the leadership of Dahal,” Sapkota quoted Sharma as saying.“The party leadership has also taken the issue raised by the standing committee members, including deputy general secretary Gajurel, Sharma, and Barshaman Pun, on a positive note.”During Dahal's tenure as prime minister, Gajurel, his political adviser, had previously expressed dissatisfaction with the party's lack of adherence to procedures and methods. As questions arose about the central leadership of the Maoist Centre, which is focused on organisational development, Dahal found himself in a defensive position during the standing committee meeting. According to party insiders, it was after a long time that Dahal faced tremendous pressure during a standing committee meeting as both Sharma and Pun, who have strong command in the party organisation, stood together to demand Dahal’s exit from the party leadership. It was something unusual for Maoist leaders as the two leaders, who defended Dahal in the past, joined hands by closing their ranks to fiercely criticise the party chief. Sharma and Pun, both former finance ministers, are deemed the two most powerful leaders after Dahal.Both leaders claimed the position of general secretary at the party’s general convention in early 2022. Though they were willing to contest for the post, Dahal instead chose Dev Gurung as the general secretary. After the general convention, Sharma has been maintaining a distance from Dahal and he challenges the party chief on various occasions. Of late, Pun, too, has joined Sharma to challenge Dahal. At the standing committee meeting, Pun said there should be a debate on the party's chairperson's term limit. \"Instead of discussing whether the leader should step down now, we need to determine the chair’s term limit,\" he added. Leaders said Dahal faced a pressure of this scale in a party meeting probably for the first time in nearly a decade, since the exit of key leaders Baburam Bhattarai and Mohan Baidya. Bhattarai and Baidya lead their own parties now. \nPanic gripped locals in ward 12 of Chandragiri Municipality, Kathmandu, on Thursday morning after a suspicious object was found in the locality.The suspicious object was spotted in front of Balambu Secondary School, sparking fears of a bomb threat.Locals informed the police, and a bomb disposal team from the Nepal Army arrived at the scene. According to the NA Directorate of Public Relations and Information, the team disposed of the suspicious object, which turned out to be a pressure cooker.   \nKathmandu Metropolitan City has extended the area to prohibit building any structure on either side of the rivers in its territory.In a notice on Wednesday, the city office stated that construction of any structure has been barred on the additional 20 meters from the existing prohibited area.According to the metropolis notice, if the city has, under the existing rule, prohibited any construction on 20 meters from the area marked as river, the prohibited area will now be altogether 40 meters on either side of the waterway.The metropolis said the decision was taken based on a recent Supreme Court verdict that directed the authorities concerned to prohibit construction within an additional 20 metres from riverbanks in the Kathmandu Valley.Currently, construction is permitted only 20 metres beyond major riverbanks in the Kathmandu metropolis.The notice issued by the metropolis states, “No construction will be permitted on an additional 20 metres of land on either side of the river, and ongoing construction will be halted.”It has also asked one and all not to release contaminated water, including sewage, into Bagmati River and its tributaries. “Private and government buildings, as well as commercial properties, must install soak pits for groundwater recharge,” it said. “Waste must not be disposed of in the rivers. Non-compliance will lead to legal action under existing laws.” \nThe rhythmic beat of the Dha echoes through a Bhaktapur alley, blending with the energetic footsteps of dancers. Bhaktapur, which sees jatras and festivals round the year, is no stranger to music, dance and celebrations. But this is not an ordinary occasion. The performers in question are Lakhe dancers who are reviving the Ranjitkar Lakhe dance after a century.The young dancers are preparing for Indra Jatra this year, where mask-clad Lakhe dancers roam the streets to rid the community of hardships and suffering. Lakhe, demon deities revered as protectors of people and crops, are thought to reside in the demonic mask. As the dancer dons the mask, the spirit is said to take over.Bhaktapur was once a key site for the Ranjitkar Lakhe performances, but the art form vanished from the city after the 1934 earthquake.“Bhaktapur suffered the most damage during the 1934 earthquake,\" says Ganesh Ram Ranjit, treasurer of the Ranjitkar Group’s Bhaktapur branch. “The destruction left residents struggling to recover for a decade, making it nearly impossible to perform the costly Lakhe dance.”The Ranjitkar Group discovered the extinct dance in the year the group was established. They located a Lakhe temple in Bhaktapur that had closed after the earthquake. After two years of research, they learned that performing the Lakhe dance was seen as a good omen in Bhaktapur and involved hosting community feasts. However, the high cost of this tradition forced many to sell their properties, rendering it unfeasible in the city’s post-earthquake conditions. Over time, the dance was abandoned as more lands supporting these cultural events were lost during rapid urbanisation.“There was a significant decline in our engagement with our cultural heritage,” says Rabi Shakya, a sculptor and Lakhe dance teacher training the new dancers. “The encouraging change now is the strong interest from the new generation, which is making it possible to revive intangible heritage like this dance.”After 100 years, the Ranjitkar Lakhe Dance is making a return to Bhaktapur at this year’s Indra Jatra.“It’s challenging to accurately re-enact the dance since it hasn’t been seen in a century,” Shakya notes. “As a sculptor, I drew inspiration from Bhaktapur’s revered Shree Navadurga Bhawani to create the Lakhe’s mask.” Similarly, the dance was choreographed by studying Lakhe dances from Kathmandu, Patan, and Banepa within the Ranjitkar community, and combining them with traditional steps from Bhaktapur Lakhe dances.“As for the musical instruments, we are using traditional instruments like Dha, Dhime, and Ponga, which are said to excite the Lakhe,” says Rajendra Maharjan, Lakhe dance teacher and musician.Maharjan is one of the experienced Newari arts teachers working to revive the lost Lakhe dance. He is involved in training young students in cultural arts and is now dedicated to the Ranjitkar dance training, with the students practising together nearly every day.“Becoming a Lakhe performer involves more than just wearing the costume and mask,” said Sudin Ranjit, a Lakhe dance student. “We must train extensively with our teachers, and it demands a lot of hard work.”To Ranjit, a resident of Bhaktapur, the training is more than learning a new craft; it is a matter of protecting culture. Growing up only interested in instruments, he slowly understood how important continuing cultural practices like Lakhe dances is for their community.“The dance will not only bolster Bhaktapur’s cultural pride but also boost tourism and create jobs,” says Dr Purushottam Lochan Shrestha, a professor and researcher specialising in Bhaktapur and Newari culture.Shrestha notes that reviving the dance would offer employment to everyone involved, from the dancers and the sculptor making the masks to those participating in the rituals. “Economic centres throughout the city, from small businesses to large industries, will benefit from the influx of tourists attracted by the Lakhe dance,” Shrestha adds, commending the Ranjitkar group's initiative.Once the Ranjitkar community revitalises the Lakhe dance, the Ranjitkar group plans to set up a new Guthi house with a fresh community fund and organise annual events for the dance.“The Lakhe dance won’t let them separate,” Shakya remarks.In today’s globalised world, where identity often merges into a homogenised blend, shared cultural practices provide a sense of connection and belonging. This new Lakhe dance embodies that spirit of togetherness for the community involved.“Reviving the dance after 100 years,” Shakya says, “is about preserving our culture for the next 300 years.” \nThe Lions Club of Kathmandu Corporate, Nepal MD325-D has felicitated various personalities as part of its endeavour to recognise the contribution of the individuals and business entities for the society.As part of its campaign, the Lions Club of Kathmandu honoured Prateek Pradhan with Social Journalism Award, Sylapa T Rimponche with Social Spiritual Award, Erika Gurung with Social Player Award, Ramesh Corporation with Social Corporate House Award, Rajendra Malla with Social Corporate Leader Award and Rajesh Hamal with Social Celebrity Award.Likewise, Chandra Ghimire is honoured with Social Bureaucratic Award, Binod Das with Sports Management Award, Anil Kedia with Social Academic Award, Mohan Ojha with Social Management Award and Surya Nepal with Corporate Social Responsibility Award.The Lionism embarked in Nepal in 1971 as the Lions Club of Biratnagar under the stewardship of former Prime Minister Matrika Prasad Koirala.The Lions Clubs International says it has over 2,000 clubs operating across the nation. \nThe government has declared a public holiday in the Kathmandu Valley on Sunday to celebrate the Bhoto Jatra.On the occasion of the festival, a public holiday has been declared in the three districts of Kathmandu Valley [Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur], according to a statement by Narayan Prasad Bhattarai, spokesperson for the Ministry of Home Affairs, on Friday.The government announces a public holiday each year on this occasion.The month-long chariot-pulling festival of Rato Machhindranath concludes with the displaying of a bhoto (a jewel-studded vest) at Jawalakhel, Lalitpur. It is an annual cultural and religious ritual of displaying the black jewel-studded vest believed to be of then Nagraj, the serpent King.Machhindranath is revered as the God of rain, good harvest and prosperity. Paying homage to Lord Machhindranath is believed to bring good luck and fulfil one’s wishes. \nSherpa Hospitality Group (SHG), a subsidiary of Yeti Group, on Friday celebrated significant milestones and unveiled exciting new ventures.

The company makes Rs450 million in transactions annually and has a Rs1 billion worth of production capacity in case of high demand.Rijal opened his own company after having worked in a dalmoth factory.“My uncle Tej Kumar opened a dalmoth factory at Urlabari, in eastern Nepal, in 1980,” said Rijal. He worked there in 1982.To sell the dalmoth produced at his uncle’s factory, Rijal travelled to many places around the country. While visiting Chitwan for sales, he saw the possibility of producing and selling dalmoth independently. In 1987, Rijal started the groundwork.In December 1987, he started production at his son-in-law’s house by frying it in a pan.Initially, the son-in-law helped Rijal. After a year, his brothers, too, joined him.Rijal then started to expand the business. “I learned the craft from production to sales and keeping accounts while working with my uncle. I had built a good network in the market. The skills I learned gave me confidence to start my own production,” he said.He visited Chitwan to Butwal and Tanahun to Bimalnagar to sell dalmoth.“My brother saw the potential every time he came to Chitwan from the eastern region to sell dalmoth. The bridge on the Narayani river had just been constructed. Narayangadh-Muglin road was being operated. All this gave him the thought of expanding the business from here,” said Purushottam Rijal, Rajendra's brother.At that time, raw materials of dalmoth could be brought on credit while the finished product sold in cash.Initially, Rijal introduced his products under the brand name ‘Shantkamal’. After six years, in 1993, he registered his firm as ‘Rijal Foods’ and started production. To give the firm a corporate structure, he renamed the company Rijal Food and Beverage Private Limited in 2015. That year, he bought 22 kattha land at Belshi, Ratnanagar municipality.There is a production plant on ten katthas. The remaining land is being used for storage.The factory currently produces 25 types of snacks, including bhujiya, chips, and furandana. The company sells snacks in 10-gram packages to 800-gram packages.“Our products reached across the country. We have 190 dealers from Taplejung in the east to Darchula in the west,” said Purushottam, the managing director.He said that the company's popular products are dalmoth, bhujiya, and chips. Made with whole dry chillies, peanuts, pieces of ginger, and curry leaves on beaten rice, furandana from Rijal Foods is consumed mostly by field and office workers.Consumers are attracted to products by their quality and packaging. Considering this, the company has adopted advanced techniques of production and packaging, said Purushottam.Rapid urbanisation has made shopping malls and department stores ubiquitous. Indian dalmoth and bhujiya brands are highly visible in these shopping centres.Nepali dalmoth used to be produced in a small area. The packaging was poor, and the marketing was not aggressive.“We were enrolled in the VAT system in 1997. This benefited us in getting support from a project in Denmark to produce unadulterated and qualitative products. For three months, they guided us,” Purushottam said.“The project helped us learn efficient fuel-saving methods, which helped increase productivity, packaging and marketing.”Rijal brothers often visited Rajasthan, India, mainly to observe various dalmoth and bhujiya factories. They even attended dalmoth and bhujiya-related fairs in India.This helped the Rijals learn about the equipment and technology used in similar factories.In 2011, Purushottam started using new technology for dalmoth production. Purushottam said that snacks like dalmoth, bhujiya, and Rijal chips have a 22 percent share of the Nepali market. Rijal's snack products have reached countries such as Italy, Belgium, Portugal, Malta, Germany, France, Australia and Japan, among others.Rajendra’s sons Swarup and Saurabh also produce pickles, ketchup, and sauce under the Rijal brand. \nWith the celebration of Janai Purnima on Monday, Nepal’s festive season has officially kicked off, and traders are hopeful that consumer demand will pick up, giving a much needed boost to the ailing economy.As the country’s key festivals, Dashain, Tihar, and Chhath, approach, traders have started placing orders in foreign markets.The festive season in Nepal traditionally sparks a significant surge in consumer spending, driving demand for everything from new clothes and jewellery to home appliances and vehicles, and propelling the retail and manufacturing sectors.Local businesses launch massive sales campaigns. The festive season in Nepal is a perfect mixture of cultural celebration and economic activity.The economic slowdown had dampened the festival season last year, but traders say they are optimistic this year.While there is no official data on festival spending, economic activity in Nepal peaks during September-November. Some economists estimate that 40 to 70 percent of market activities occur around these three key festivals.It is estimated that many people save throughout the year to spend during these festivals.Business houses, banks, and government officials receive bonuses for the festivals, and suppliers are keen to capitalise on the anticipated increase in demand.Last Dashain, the cash crunch forced consumers to cut back on purchases. But this year, banks have sufficient liquidity, and traders are optimistic about sales growth.Ramu Paudel, spokesperson at Nepal Rastra Bank, the country’s central bank, said that the trend of opening letters of credit (LC) to import goods ahead of the festive season has been promising.“Based on this trend, we also expect a rise in international trade this year.” Nepal's imports declined for two consecutive fiscal years, reversing several years of surging imports.According to the central bank, merchandise imports decreased 1.2 percent to Rs1.59 trillion in the last fiscal year that ended mid-July, against a decrease of 16.1 percent a year ago. Earlier, Nepal's imports declined by 7.2 percent in the fiscal year 2001-02.The Post talked to a few traders about the demand outlook.Automobile dealers are particularly optimistic and excited about this year’s festive sales.“The automobile business slowed down after the pandemic. However, the growing demand for electric vehicles (EVs) has made us hopeful this year,” said Puskar Ojha, vice president of Nepal Automobile Dealers’ Association.“The banks have enough liquidity and are ready to lend, especially for EVs. We hope EV sales will rise by 25 percent this festive season,” he said. EV sales cover 50-60 percent of the overall automobile market share. The association is organising the NADA Auto Show 2024 from August 27 to September 1. The show is expected to draw 75,000 visitors.“The new government has brought hope, and the market is also turning positive, so the overall sales of automobiles are expected to rise this festive season,” said Ojha.Automobile traders said that new models and variants of two-wheelers and four-wheelers have started arriving in the market, targeting the auto show. In the last fiscal year, Nepal’s gross foreign exchange reserves increased 32.6 percent to Rs2.04 trillion, a historic high fueled by remittance inflows of Rs1.44 trillion, the highest amount on record.The distributors of consumer electronic goods are also optimistic and excited about extravagant festive sales.Alok Gupta, general manager of Samsung Consumer Electronic Goods, said, “There is optimism in the market.” “Observing the greening of the share market has given most businesses, including us, a sense of hope.”He said they anticipated a 25 percent growth in consumer home appliance sales this festive season.“There is a slowdown in market activities, but since banks have sufficient liquidity, it provides hope for all,” Gupta said. According to Him Electronics, the authorised distributor of Samsung electronics goods in Nepal, the company is launching new TVs, refrigerators, and washing machines just in time for the Dashain. The new offers are expected to be introduced at the beginning of September.“As we target 25 percent growth in sales, we plan for a good price offer to boost the sales. So, consumer electronic goods will not be expensive this festive season.” Bharat Karki, vice president of Nepal Trans Himalaya Border Commerce Association, said that imports of readymade garments, raw materials for apparel and shoes, as well as mobile phones and accessories have risen by 40 percent this year, mainly targeted for the festival season.“We have seen a rise in the number of distributors coming to Kathmandu and placing orders this year.”“The demand may not reach the pre-Covid levels, but it’s improving.” He said 40 cargo containers enter Nepal daily from the northern border points, loaded with festive goods.However, there are complaints from traders in New Road, once a major shopping hub.Kumar Karki, president of the Federation of National Traders Nepal, said that businesses in New Road may face repercussions since the Kathmandu Metropolitan City has not allowed roadside parking.“Shopper footfall has already dropped. Due to the parking restriction, we are not very optimistic about the upcoming festive sales.”According to Nepal Rastra Bank, the country's readymade garment imports increased 35.9 percent to Rs33.26 billion in the last fiscal year. The inflation of clothes and footwear remained at 4.56 percent. \nA World Health Organization official stressed on Tuesday that mpox, regardless of whether it is the new or old strain, is not the new Covid, as authorities know how to control its spread.“We can and must tackle mpox together,” said Hans Kluge, WHO regional director for Europe, in a UN media briefing.“So will we choose to put the systems in place to control and eliminate mpox globally? Or we will enter another cycle of panic and neglect? How we respond now and in the years to come will prove a critical test for Europe and the world,” he added.Mpox, a viral infection that causes pus-filled lesions and flu-like symptoms, is usually mild but can kill.The clade 1b variety has caused global concern because it seems to spread more easily through routine close contact.A case of the variant was confirmed last week in Sweden and linked to a growing outbreak in Africa, the first sign of its spread outside the continent. The WHO declared the recent outbreak of the disease a public health emergency of international concern after the new variant was identified.Kluge said that the focus on the new clade 1 strain will also help in the fight against the less severe clade 2 variety that has spreading globally since 2022, allowing Europe to improve its response through better health advice and surveillance.About 100 new cases of the clade 2 mpox strain are now being reported in the European region every month, added Kluge.Mpox transmits through close physical contact, including sexual contact, but unlike previous global pandemics such as Covid-19, there is no evidence it spreads easily through the air.Health authorities need to be on alert and flexible in case there are new, more transmissible clades or ones that change their transmission route, but there are no recommendations for people to wear masks, said WHO spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic. \nThe 500 rapid diagnostic test kits supplied by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division to the Anbukhaireni Rural Municipality of Tanahun two weeks ago were used up within two days.Along with the test kits, the division also issued directives to launch a search-and-destroy drive, mobilise female community health volunteers, and deploy social workers to destroy the breeding grounds for the disease vectors.Despite the rural municipality grappling with a massive dengue outbreak, with over 1,000 positive cases in a single ward within a month, the federal government's central disease control body has yet to dispatch an expert team to conduct vector surveillance. Health workers at the local unit said that they expect federal agencies to monitor health facilities overwhelmed with infected patients and ensure that preventive measures have been properly enforced.“More than the directives, we need test kits, essential medicines and health workers to care for the patients in our hospitals,” Agam Raj Upadhyaya, health coordinator of the rural municipality, told the Post over the phone from Anbukhaireni. “Neither the Ministry of Health and Population of the federal government nor the agencies under the provincial government have taken the issue seriously, even after a massive dengue outbreak hit the entire local unit.”Health workers in the virus-hit local unit said that over 50 people test positive for the dengue virus daily in Aanbukhaireni Rural Municipality alone. Local health facilities are struggling to cope with the overwhelming number of seriously ailing people. Patients are being treated on benches and even on the floors of health facilities, according to health officials working at the municipality. Some patients go to Chitwan, Pokhara, and even Kathmandu for treatment.“Due to a human resource crunch, we have pulled health workers from peripheral health posts to help in hospitals overwhelmed with dengue patients,” said Upadhyaya. “Over 45 patients are being treated in a 15-bed hospital. We expect help from provincial and federal government agencies to care for seriously ailing patients.”Health workers said they are doing their best to contain the spread of the deadly disease, but their measures, including the search-and-destroy drive, have become ineffective. Officials concede that the drive was launched only after the massive outbreak of the virus, and the ongoing rainfall has been hindering the measures taken to destroy the breeding grounds of mosquitoes.”Officials admit that the actual number of dengue cases could be higher as people with mild symptoms are not getting tested and are resting at home.What worries health workers the most is that with the spike in positive cases, they also see an increase in seriously ill patients.Officials admit that the real number of infections could be several times higher, as the government’s case reporting system is not very effective, and more than 80 percent of the cases are asymptomatic.Public health experts say that the ongoing spread of dengue infection could have been prevented had the authorities concerned taken the problems seriously and launched the search-and-destroy drive.“How can we expect to prevent the spread of the virus by waiting to take measures until there is a massive outbreak of the disease?” asked Dr Baburam Marasini, a public health expert. “We have created only the agencies to give directions, not the ones to take action. Agencies under the federal government must help local units carry out surveillance, determine the serotype of the virus and provide care to patients.”Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika, according to the World Health Organisation.So far this year, two died, and 3,755 tested positive for the dengue virus that has spread in 74 districts across the country.Public health experts warn that dengue cases could escalate in the coming days in other districts as well, as heavy rainfall continues across the country and post-monsoons season, which is considered the main dengue season, is yet to start.Experts say a massive awareness campaign is instrumental in destroying the breeding ground of the dengue-spreading vector, and the public must be made aware of the treatment.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects such as plastic cups and bottles could be breeding grounds for dengue-carrying mosquitoes.According to doctors, mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache and pain in the eyes are some of the symptoms of dengue. Doctors advise that those with these symptoms should seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and access to proper medical care can lower fatalities.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district. Since then, an increasing number of dengue infections and major outbreaks have been reported from many districts. \nNepal witnessed an alarming rise in the suicide cases in the last fiscal year.According to data provided by the Nepal Police, 7,223 people killed themselves in the fiscal year 2023-024, which is the highest ever recorded in a year.“Around 20 people killed themselves on an average every 24-hour in the last fiscal year,” said Dr Pomawati Thapa, chief of the Non-communicable Disease and Mental Health Section at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “The number is the highest ever recorded in any fiscal year.”Nepal is among the countries with the highest suicide rates.Police data show that 6,993 people killed themselves in the fiscal year 2022-023, followed by 6,792 in the fiscal year 2021-022.As many as 7,117 people took their own lives in the fiscal year 2020-021, during which the country witnessed the second and third wave of the coronavirus pandemic. Reducing one-third of premature mortality from non-communicable diseases through prevention, treatment and promotion of mental health and well-being is among the UN-backed Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) targets to which Nepal is committed.Experts say the suicide rate is an indicator of premature mortality within the SDGs, which are a follow-up to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).“At the time when the government committed to SDGs in 2015, around 16 people took their own lives every 24 hours,” said Basudev Karki, a consultant psychiatrist. “Now the number has risen to 20. Our government had committed to reduce the suicide rate to 9.7 per 100,000 each year by 2022, but this number rose to 24, and last year it increased further to 25.”The government aims to reduce the suicide rate to 4.7 per 100,000 population by 2030 to meet the SDG targets, but as the deadline nears, more people are killing themselves every day. Mental health experts say people do not attempt suicide for any single reason, but rather due to a complex mix of factors including the rising cost of living and struggle to manage even their most basic needs such as food, housing, healthcare, and job security.Whatever the cause, suicides and suicide attempts have a ripple effect, impacting not only the individual but also families, friends, colleagues, communities, and societies, according to themA study carried out by the Nepal Health Research Council before the start of the pandemic shows that more than 10 percent of the adult population had mental issues in their lifetime and 4.3 percent were undergoing some sort of mental crisis.The prevalence of suicidality, including current suicidal thoughts, past suicide attempts, and a future likelihood of suicidal thoughts, was found to be prevalent in the 7.2 percent population.“Even those individuals who appear healthy on the outside could also be struggling with serious mental health problems,” said Karki. “People generally do not like to talk about mental health issues due to the social stigma attached, and lack of awareness. To tackle the growing mental health problems, authorities concerned have to take multiple approaches.”Meanwhile, officials at the Ministry of Health and Population said that they are aware of the growing burden of mental health issues and the rising suicide rate and have been taking various measures to address the problems.“Along with providing free medications for mental health problems at state-run health facilities, we have been taking several other measures that include imparting mental health screening training for health workers,” said Thapa, chief of the Non-communicable Disease and Mental Health Section at the division. “We have been working to declare two local units—Palungtar Municipality of Gorkha and Bagchaur Municipality of Salyan—as model municipalities for mental health.”According to officials, various mental health programmes will be rolled out in these local units, including screening for mental health problems and training for health workers, community workers, teachers, female community health volunteers, and others. Awareness campaigns will be launched, and health facilities will be strengthened to provide basic services for mental health problems.“This programme will be launched as a pilot and will be gradually expanded to other local units,” said Thapa. “The main aim of the programme is to encourage the local bodies to take responsibility for addressing the growing mental health issues. We will also launch an awareness drive to reduce the suicide rate, alcohol consumption, and substance use.”The World Health Organisation says one in four people in the world are affected by mental or neurological disorders at some point in their lives, and around 450 million people currently suffer from such conditions, placing mental disorders among the leading causes of ill health and disability worldwide.If you or someone you know is considering suicide, please contact the following helplines.Nepal Mental Hospital suicide hotline: 1166Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital suicide prenvention hotline: 9840021600:Patan Hospital crisis helpline for suicide prevention: 9813476123The Transcultural Psychosocial Organisation: 16600102005 \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar. \nThe noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built. Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nNepal made sure they entered into the semi-finals of the SAFF U-20 Championship as group winners as they defeated Bangladesh 2-1 at the ANFA Complex in Satdobato, Lalitpur on Thursday.Samir Tamang and Nirajan Dhami scored two quick goals for Nepal in the first half, which sealed the victory for the Gorkhalis.Two wins in as many matches gave Nepal six points and a summit finish in Group A. They will face the runners-up of Group B in the last four at the Dasharath Stadium.India will meet the Maldives in the last match of Group B on Friday.India and Bhutan have three points each. The Maldives lost their opening match to Bhutan 2-1 on Wednesday. However, Bhutan will be secretly praying that the Maldivians lose against India so that they could qualify for their third semi-finals.The Maldives will progress into the knockouts if they defeat defending champions India, who are also the winners of the last three editions of the championship.Both Nepal and Bangladesh were already assured of their places in the last four after winning their opening group games against Sri Lanka, who crashed out after two consecutive defeats.Nepal started the game confidently and got to work right away with the lead after 17 minutes, thanks to a howler from Bangladesh captain and goalkeeper Md Mehdi Hasan Srabon.Srabon had come far off the post, and with no immediate threats surrounding him, the goalkeeper only had a simple job of taking care of an incoming ball coming from the other end. But the overconfident goalie took the moment too lightly that allowed Tamang to sprint between two unaware defenders, seize possession of the ball off the helpless Srabon and score into an empty net.And when Bangladesh had not even finished thinking how glaring their mistake was, their plight doubled as Mohsin Ahmed’s attempt to stay clear of a cross from Abinash Syangtan went into his own post.Bangladesh’s first attempt at goal came in the 27th minute when Md Ashraful Haque Asif arrowed a venomous shot from distance but Nepal goalkeeper Jiyarat Shekh was alert and made a diving save to foil the effort.Dhami had an opportunity to take his tournament goal tally to three in the 36th minute, but his header off a precise cross from Niraj Karki could not find the target.Bangladesh reduced the deficit in the 43rd minute through a penalty kick that was awarded to them after Ram Thapa and Ashwin Ghorasainee sandwiched Mirajul Islam and brought the opponent player down inside their own penalty area.Mirajul stepped up and made no mistake from the spot kick.The second half was largely a drab affair.Despite conceding, Nepal were happy to sit back and defend after the restart.But Bangladesh could not shake a strong Nepal defence until the final seconds of the five-minute stoppage time.Md Rostom Islam Dukhu Mia’s header off a cross from Md Rabby Hossen Rahul almost snatched an equaliser but Nepal’s netkeeper Shekh stretched full length to preserve Nepal’s lead.Coach Urjan Shrestha and Nepal are aiming to break India’s latest dominance in the championship by winning their third SAFF age-group championship trophy. \nPortugal’s Cristiano Ronaldo launched his YouTube channel on Wednesday and hundreds of thousands of subscribers signed up within a couple of hours.The 39-year-old five-times Ballon D’Or winner plays for Saudi Arabian club Al Nassr.“The wait is over. My @YouTube channel is finally here! SIUUUbscribe and join me on this new journey,” Ronaldo posted on his social media accounts.A couple of hours after posting his first video, 1.69M subscribers had joined the channel.Ronaldo has 112.5 million followers on the X platform, 170 million on Facebook and 636 million on Instagram.The former Real Madrid and Manchester United player is preparing for his team’s Saudi Pro League opener against Al-Raed on Thursday. \nIndia’s Narendra Modi arrived in wartime Kyiv on Friday to hold talks with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the first trip by an Indian prime minister to Ukraine since Kyiv gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.The visit comes at a volatile juncture in the war in Ukraine, with Ukrainian forces still in Russia’s western Kursk region following their incursion on August 6 and Russian troops grinding out slow but steady advances in Ukraine’s east.The visit, which follows a trip by Modi to Moscow in July, is important for Western-backed Kyiv, which has been trying to nurture diplomatic relations in the Global South in its efforts to secure a fair settlement to end the war.“Reached Kyiv earlier this morning. The Indian community accorded a very warm welcome,” Modi wrote on X. The Ukrainian railways company showed footage of him stepping off a train carriage and being received by Ukrainian officials.In the run-up to the trip, he said he was looking forward to sharing “perspectives on peaceful resolution of the ongoing Ukraine conflict”.Modi’s visit to Moscow last month coincided with a heavy Russian missile strike on Ukraine that hit a children’s hospital. The attack prompted Modi to use emotive language to deliver an implicit rebuke to Putin at their summit.But the trip elicited fierce criticism from Zelenskiy who said it was a “huge disappointment and a devastating blow to peace efforts to see the leader of the world’s largest democracy hug the world’s most bloody criminal in Moscow on such a day”.Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser in the Ukrainian president’s office, told Reuters Modi’s visit to Kyiv was significant because New Delhi “really has a certain influence” over Moscow.“It’s extremely important for us to effectively build relations with such countries, to explain to them what the correct end to the war is - and that it is also in their interests,” he said.India, which has traditionally had close economic and defence ties with Moscow, has publicly criticised the deaths of innocent people in the war.But it has also strengthened its economic ties with Moscow after Western nations imposed sanctions on Russia and cut trade relations with it over the invasion.Indian refiners which rarely bought Russian oil in the past have emerged as Moscow’s top clients for sea-borne oil since Russia poured troops into Ukraine in February 2022. Russian oil accounts for over two-fifths of India’s oil imports.PEACE VISIONUkraine has said it hopes to bring together a second international summit later this year to advance its vision of peace and involve representatives from Russia.The first summit in Switzerland that pointedly excluded Russia in June attracted scores of delegations, including one from India, but not from China, the world’s second-largest economy.“Lasting peace can only be achieved through options that are acceptable to both parties. And it can only be a negotiated settlement,” Tanmaya Lal, Secretary (West) in the Indian foreign ministry, told reporters.“This is an important visit that is expected to catalyze our ties in a whole range of sectors,” Lal said, listing economic and business links, agriculture, infrastructure, health and education, pharmaceuticals, defence and culture.Volodymyr Fesenko, a Kyiv-based political analyst, said he expected no breakthrough proposals to be made to end the war during the trip by Modi, who visited Poland on Thursday.For there to be an attempt to negotiate, the military situation has to stabilise and the presidential election must be held in the United States, a close ally of Ukraine, he said.He said the visit was important for India to demonstrate it was “not on Russia’s side” and that Kyiv wanted to normalise relations after Modi’s Moscow trip. \nVice President Kamala Harris formally accepted the Democratic nomination for president on Thursday with a rousing call to end the war in Gaza and to fight tyranny around the world, drawing a sharp contrast with Republican Donald Trump.“In the enduring struggle between democracy and tyranny, I know where I stand and I know where the United States belongs,” Harris said, accusing Trump of bowing down to dictators.On the final, and most anticipated, night of the four-day Chicago convention, Harris, 59, promised to chart a “New Way Forward” as she and Trump, 78, enter the final 11 weeks of the razor-close campaign.Harris emerged as the Democratic candidate little more than a month ago when allies of President Joe Biden, 81, forced him to quit the race.It was a forceful speech for a candidate who, during her brief campaign, had yet to articulate much of her vision for the country and faced a stream of personal attacks from Trump, who mocked her Black and South Asian heritage and called her weak on the foreign stage.The speech laid out some broad policy principles, foreign and domestic, but left unsaid specific details which in weeks to come she could be pressured to provide.After days of protests from Palestinian supporters who were disappointed at not getting a speaking spot at the convention, Harris delivered a pledge to secure Israel, bring the hostages home from Gaza and end the war in the Palestinian enclave.“Now is the time to get a hostage deal and a ceasefire deal done,” she said to cheers. “And let me be clear, I will always stand up for Israel’s right to defend itself and I will always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself.”“What has happened in Gaza over the past 10 months is devastating. So many innocent lives lost, desperate hungry people fleeing for safety over and over again. The scale of suffering is heartbreaking,” she said.“President Biden and I are working to end this war such that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom and self-determination.”In some of her strongest foreign policy statements to date, Harris said she would take whatever action was necessary to defend US interests against Iran and would not cosy up to tyrants and dictators.She said such leaders, including North Korea’s Kim Jong Un, “are rooting for Trump.”She vowed to stand with Ukraine in its war against Russia and with NATO allies.HARRIS WOULD BE FIRST FEMALE US PRESIDENTIf successful, Harris stands to make history as the first woman elected US president.She described the November 5 election as a “precious, fleeting opportunity to move past the bitterness, cynicism and divisive battles of the past. A chance to chart a New Way Forward.”Harris drew a series of contrasts with Trump, accusing him of not fighting for the middle class, planning to enact a tax hike through his tariff proposals, and having set in motion the end of a constitutional right to abortion with his picks for the US Supreme Court.Harris noted the Supreme Court’s recent ruling about presidential immunity and the risks that would engender if Trump gained power again.“Just imagine Donald Trump with no guard rails,” she said.Trump, who had promised to respond to Harris’ speech in real-time, posted a series of messages on Truth Social as she spoke about him, including: “She stands for Incompetence and Weakness – Our Country is being laughed at all over the World!” and “She will never be respected by the Tyrants of the World!”FINAL NIGHTChicago’s United Center brimmed with energy – and people. The arena’s 23,500 seats were filled and arena staff briefly blocked more people from entering the facility, saying the city’s fire marshal declared the building at capacity.After Harris ended her speech, 100,000 balloons descended on the crowd, a convention official said. Inflating them took 75 volunteers, 30 staff members and a dozen unionized stagehands.Biden called Harris to wish her luck before her speech, a White House spokesperson said.On Thursday night, Harris said she will pass a middle tax cut that will benefit more than 100 million Americans.She discussed her plans to fight for abortion rights, voting rights legislation, boost the housing supply and ban what she has called “price gouging” by grocers. Her campaign has also proposed raising the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%.Before the speech, thousands of Palestinian supporters once again gathered to protest US support for Israel as it wages war in Gaza. The issue is one of the most divisive among Democrats and got little attention at the convention, which could hurt Democrats at the polls.Delegates from the Uncommitted National Movement, which mobilized nearly 750,000 voters to withhold support for Biden during the presidential primaries, entered the venue linking arms and took their seats. Members spent Wednesday night on the sidewalk outside the convention to protest the DNC’s rejection of their request for a Palestinian speaker.Harris has raised a record-breaking $500 million in a month and narrowed the gap or taken the lead against Trump in many opinion polls of battleground states. Nationwide, she leads Trump 46.6% to 43.8%, according to a compilation of polls by FiveThirtyEight. \nThe daughter of a Jamaican father and Indian mother, both immigrants, Kamala Harris reflects the United States’ changing demographics.When she steps onto the stage Thursday evening in Chicago to accept the Democratic Party’s nomination as their presidential candidate, she will represent the country’s fastest-growing racial category.Some 42 million Americans now identify as multiracial, or 13% of the country, according to the US Census Bureau. That is up from 2% in 2000 when the census first allowed people to select multiple races.America has long been a self-styled “melting pot” of people who trace their origins around the world, but in practice some states legally segregated citizens by race until the civil rights laws of the 1960s and laws prohibiting interracial marriage were not overturned until 1967.Social change since, though, has been rapid. Barack Obama was elected as the country’s first Black president in 2008, and Harris would be the first Black woman and South Asian if elected in November.“We’re living in a situation 50 years later where we could be looking at our second mixed-race president, and it’s beautiful,” said Svante Myrick, president of People for the American Way, an advocacy group, whose father was Black and his mother white.America’s future will look even more diverse. The vast majority of multiracial people are younger than 44 and a third are still children.The trend has been met by confusion, upset and worse from some of the US’s shrinking white majority. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump drew groans at a gathering of Black journalists last month when he falsely portrayed Harris as pivoting from Indian to Black.“I don’t know, is she Indian or is she Black,” Trump said. “But you know what, I respect either one.”Harris has long identified with both her parents’ ancestry. In Trump’s remarks, some multiracial people saw echoes of their own experience of being asked to choose one or the other.Harris’ upbringing makes her a better leader for America, Democrats in Chicago said.“When you have individuals who carry multiple experiences in the same person, that's an asset,” said Representative Maxwell Frost, who is Lebanese, Puerto Rican and Haitian, speaking at a Politico event on the sidelines of the convention. “That enhances her ability to legislate and advocate\" on behalf of a broad range of Americans.The Harris campaign did not respond to a request for comment, nor did spokespeople for Trump.As the US becomes more diverse and multicultural, white nationalist groups continue to thrive online, pushing conspiracy theories such as the “The Great Replacement”, while some Republican lawmakers have focused on banning books and cancelling classes focused on racial history.Thousands of racial hate crimes are reported yearly, with 232 aimed at people of multiple races in 2022, the most recent year for which FBI data is available.“Unfortunately, we’re really into a period of backlash,” said Matthew Belmont, a Dartmouth College history professor who has studied the demographic trend, despite the 2020 election of Harris as vice president and her administration's elevation of racial justice priorities.Tara Betrayer, an Afro-Latina and white conservative co-founder of political action committee the Seneca Project, said she was once attracted to the Republican Party in part because of its emphasis on color-blind policies.“Do Democrats take it too far at times with racial identity politics? Well, yeah,” she said.Now an independent, Betrayer said some of the Republican Party’s recent rhetoric on issues including illegal migration carried undercurrents of racism. Republicans reject those criticisms, saying their focus on border controls are aimed at securing the country for all Americans.“This is really their last gasp at trying to stop the country from evolving, and I think they’re missing out on something that’s beautiful,” Betrayer said. \nIndonesia’s parliament postponed ratifying changes to an elections law on Thursday amid protests in multiple cities, following outcry over legislation seen to strengthen the political influence of outgoing President Joko Widodo.The plenary session to pass the changes was delayed due to a lack of a quorum, legislator Habiburokhman told reporters outside the parliament building.It is unclear if parliament will reconvene to pass the law before the registration for regional elections opens next Tuesday.The parliament planned to ratify changes that would have reversed a ruling by the constitutional court earlier this week. The legislative changes would have blocked a vocal government critic in the race for the influential post of Jakarta governor and also paved the way for Widodo’s youngest son to run in elections in Java this November.The power struggle between the parliament and the judiciary comes amid a week of dramatic political developments in the world’s third-largest democracy and in the final stretch of the president’s second term.Widodo downplayed the concerns, saying on Wednesday the court ruling and parliamentary deliberations were part of standard “checks and balances” .The home affairs minister said the changes were intended to provide legal certainty.More than 1,000 demonstrators gathered on Thursday outside the parliament building in Jakarta and across multiple cities in Java, some holding banners accusing Jokowi of destroying democracy. Authorities fired tear gas at demonstrators in Semarang, according to footage from Kompas TV.“This is the peak of my disdain,” said Afif Sidik, a 29-year-old teacher who joined the protest outside parliament.“This is a republic. It’s a democracy, but if its leadership is decided by one person, or an oligarch, we can’t accept that.”Legal experts and political analysts have described the power struggle as bordering on a constitutional crisis.Elections analyst Titi Anggraini characterised the manoeuvre as “constitutional insubordination”.The street protests follow a wave of criticism online, with blue posters featuring the words “Emergency Warning” above Indonesia’s national eagle proliferating on social media.The rupiah and Jakarta’s main stock index (.JKSE), slumped by midday Thursday, hit by concerns of protests as well as the country’s widening current account deficit.‘THIS IS A POWER STRUGGLE’The Constitutional Court on Tuesday revoked a minimum threshold requirement to nominate candidates in regional elections and kept the minimum age limit of 30 years for candidates.That ruling effectively blocks the candidacy of the president’s 29-year-old son from contesting the race for deputy governor in Central Java, and would allow Anies Baswedan, the current favourite, to run in Jakarta.But within 24 hours the parliament had tabled an emergency revision to annul the changes.All parties except one, the Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P), have agreed to the revision of the law.“Indonesian democracy is once again at a crucial crossroads,” Anies posted on social media platform X, urging legislators to remember its fate rested in their hands.The parliament is now dominated by a big-tent coalition aligned to the outgoing president, popularly known as Jokowi, and president-elect Prabowo Subianto.Prabowo, who won a landslide victory in February’s elections, will be inaugurated on Oct. 20, with Jokowi's eldest son, Gibran Rakabuming Raka, as his vice president.Jokowi is facing mounting criticism for the increasingly bold ways his government is consolidating power, and over the creation of his own political dynasty.“The ruling of the constitutional court is final and binding,” said Bivitri Susanti, from the Jentera School of Law, “It is not possible for the legislative body to violate the judiciary's ruling. This is a power struggle.”First elected in 2014, Jokowi was at the time hailed as a democratic hero, in large part because he was seen as untethered from the country’s entrenched oligarchy and military elite.The president has been praised for his solid economic record but increasingly criticised for the democratic decline of the country’s institutions during his decade in office. \nAt least 17 people were killed in an explosion on Thursday at a pharmaceuticals manufacturing plant in southern India’s Andhra Pradesh state, a district government official said.The fire broke out in the afternoon at privately held Escientia Advanced Sciences’ 40-acre manufacturing unit that was operational since 2019 in the state’s Anakapalli district, according to district collector Vijaya Krishnan.“The injured have been shifted to nearby hospitals...it appears that there could have been a blast at the chemical reactor,” Krishnan’s office told Reuters, adding that the blast occurred during lunchtime at the unit.Nearly 40 people were injured and rescue operations had been completed, the official, Industries Secretary N. Yuvaraj, told Reuters.Escientia did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The state government has ordered an inquiry into the incident.Officials said they were scanning closed-circuit television footage and questioning the injured to decide if human error was responsible for the blast.“Preliminary investigation shows ... there was some vapour leak that led to chemical reactions, which caused the explosion,” added Yuvaraj, who identified the solvent involved as methyl tert-butyl ether.In a post on X, Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered condolences to the relatives of the dead.India, known as the pharmacy of the world, is home to many plants that make pharmaceuticals.Last year, two people were killed and five others were injured in a similar fire accident that broke out in a solvent reactor at a unit of Sahithi Pharma in the Anakapalli district. \nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nWhat animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. \nNepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) \nEducation diplomacy is a powerful tool for establishing mutually beneficial relationships between nations. It involves strategically using diplomatic skills and practices to build and maintain relationships and collaborations, fostering partnerships among various stakeholders to achieve common goals in the education sector. Countries view educational opportunities for international students as a critical strategy for advancing their soft power agendas. However, Nepal has yet to realise its value, as the outcry of international students facing visa-related and other issues in Nepal has still not received sufficient attention among policymakers and educators.A nation's internationalisation policy in higher education is crucial in promoting economic growth and projecting goodwill toward other nations. For example, China has successfully utilised public diplomacy, culture and international education as soft power instruments. The country attracted 255,720 students in 2021 alone by presenting a peaceful and friendly image of its growing economy. China's success is partly attributed to its seven universities, which are ranked in the latest Times Higher Education’s global top 100 world rankings. In contrast, India's foreign student population, which was approximately 46,000 in 2021-22, remains much lower than that of leading countries like the United States (US), the United Kingdom and Australia, indicating that the government hasn’t fully capitalised on this diplomatic tool. However, India has made a notable progress, as there has been an increase of nearly 42 percent in foreign student enrollment over the past seven years. As part of its rebranding as a net aid provider, India has emphasised education diplomacy by reducing incoming aid, increasing foreign assistance and promoting internationalisation in higher education through initiatives like scholarships, the South Asia University proposal and global outreach expansion through institutions like Indira Gandhi National Open University.Cultural diversity is a vital aspect of education diplomacy. Many countries, like the US, China and India, engage in extensive cultural exchange programmes rather than just awarding degrees. The International Visitors Leadership Programme (IVLP), a premier professional exchange initiative of the US Department of State, is one of the oldest programmes. Every year, nearly 5,000 International Visitors participate in the IVLP. Through short-term visits to the US, current and emerging foreign leaders in various fields gain firsthand experience and build strong relationships with their American counterparts. Similarly, China fosters cultural exchanges through the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), while India has institutions like the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) to promote cultural interactions.Education diplomacy is becoming a significant revenue source for governments. Attracting international students by signing a memorandum of understanding with various universities contributes to the universities' reach, reputation and revenue. When a nation positions itself as a higher education centre, its global influence increases. As more international students enrol in higher education institutions (HEIs), the institution's reputation will amplify, aiding in branding and internationalisation. The influx of foreign students also provides a substantial revenue stream for the host country. India is working to internationalise its education system by promoting students, faculties, programmes and campus mobility; all these initiatives support education diplomacy. For instance, an Indian student studying in Nepal will be exposed to the Nepali lifestyle and culture, fostering cultural understanding and bonding between the two countries. Attracting international students can also create a broad base of supporters.Status of Nepali universitiesNepali universities’ efforts in international relations and collaborations are far from encouraging. With the mass exodus of students abroad, the situation is bleak. There is no evaluation or national ranking system for Nepali HEIs, making it difficult to achieve even moderate rankings globally. The main issue with Nepali HEIs is employability rather than the quality of education. While universities are experiencing low enrollment, no concerted efforts have been made to compensate for this loss by attracting international students to Nepal. Additional challenges include low investment in research and innovation and a lack of competent faculty, leading to fewer university collaborations worldwide. Procedural challenges such as unclear visa policies and difficulties opening bank accounts and payments aggravate the situation. There is also ambiguity regarding the status of dependents or family members accompanying students while coming to Nepal.Despite the inherent challenges, Kathmandu University (KU) has taken steps to promote internationalisation. For example, foreign faculty members are offered a salary 1.5 times higher than local faculties, a modest effort to attract international talent. The Vice-Chancellor Scholarship Scheme has been introduced, providing scholarships to at least one foreign student in each school based on merit. Moreover, KU is running several programmes in collaboration with international HEIs, such as the M-Tech in Energy Systems (KU-Indian Institute Of Technology (IIT) Madras, India), Bachelor in Yogic Science and Well-being (KU-Sri Visweswara Yoga Research Institute, Tirupati, India), Bachelor of Information Technology (KU-Crown Institute of Higher Education, Australia) and a Joint PhD Program (KU-IIT Hyderabad), among others.Role of stakeholdersTo unleash Nepal’s education sector's potential, continuous support from a robust policy ecosystem, institutional strengthening, and increased investment are required. Although education diplomacy has been limited so far, Nepali diplomats must proactively find solutions. In other countries, presidents or heads of state often visit HEIs to assess the situation and initiate educational activities; however, such practices are uncommon among Nepali diplomats. The government should immediately work to ensure a smooth and hassle-free entry process for students wishing to study in Nepal. Necessary steps should be taken to make it easier for foreign students to pay tuition and other fees. The process for converting tourist or visit visas to student visas should be expedited. Universities should also provide insurance for foreign students, ensuring their sense of security in a new country. Moreover, universities should mobilise the Nepali diaspora and alums community to market local courses in niche areas, increasing global awareness and interest in Nepali Universities. \nOn August 14, 2024, the House of Representatives (HoR) passed the bill to amend the “Enforced Disappearances Enquiry” and “Truth and Reconciliation Commission” Acts 2014 without substantial debate, undermining the rights of the victims. Following its adoption by the National Assembly and the approval of the President, the bill will be enacted as a third amendment.Addressing the lower house before passing the bill, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, Nepali Congress president Sher Bahadur Deuba and Maoist Centre chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal expressed their shared views on the bill, claiming it was victim-centric, met international standards and complied with Supreme Court orders. However, except for rape cases and serious sexual violence, intentional or arbitrary killing, enforced disappearances and inhumane or cruel torture, the bill doesn’t meet their claim. The primary concerns lie in categorising crimes, which remain unaddressed. While some groups have welcomed and supported the bill, mainstream victim groups, nevertheless, are advocating to make the process ‘victim-centric’ to attain tangible results. They have continuously pressed the lawmakers to improve the objectionable flaws and seize the opportunity that comes with the amendment. Serious flawsNot recognising “surviving enforced disappeared” people as victims is one of the flaws contradicting the international definition. Engaging child soldiers (verified by UNMIN) in war crimes committed by security forces or armed groups is confined to reparation in the bill. The classified non-pardonable serious human rights violations and pardonable human rights violations are severely problematic. The crimes that fall under serious human rights violations are kept in the ambit of human rights violations, which has caused a strong objection to not complying with the principles established in our so-called nationally driven process.Besides the grave human rights violations, according to the bill, any crimes committed against Nepal’s prevailing law, international human rights, or humanitarian laws are categorised as amnestiable. This means that crimes like torture, kidnapping, amputation and disability with serious torture, including war crimes and crimes against humanity, are subject to amnesty with the free consent of the victims. It also has a provision of a 75-percent reduction in sentencing, amounting to disguised amnesty, which contradicts the principle that criminal sanctions must be proportionate to the gravity of the crime and undermines the fundamental role and competency of the judiciary. Such provisions neither comply with international standards nor follow the Supreme Court orders. Widespread concernsThe bill has drawn international attention, with many diplomatic envoys and development partners taking to social media to comment and congratulate. On X, the UN Resident Coordinator Hanna Singer-Hamdy cautiously commented, “Engaging victims is imperative ... The UN stands ready to support inclusive TJ aligning with international human rights commitment and standards”. US Ambassador Dean R Thompson congratulated but also diplomatically stated, “A meaningful moment in Nepal’s journey to shaping its own peaceful, prosperous, resilient and democratic future”. EU and Swiss ambassadors called it a historic achievement and reiterated their full support for its implementation. These X posts from the development partners are perceived as goodwill gestures for completing the peace process without delay. However, they don’t ignore international obligations and criminal accountability under this pretext. The legitimacy of the whole process lies in adhering to transitional justice (TJ) principles, which are based on truth-seeking, justice, reparation and non-occurrence through institutional reforms. Nepal’s long-time commitments to international human rights and humanitarian laws come into the picture. Addressing the deeply rooted impunity and putting the country back on track with the rule of law towards a functioning and inclusive democracy and sustainable peace is essential. During UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’ official visit to Nepal in October, TJ was recognised as a complex but vital way of securing lasting peace. Addressing Parliament, he said TJ needed to be inclusive and comprehensive and keep victims at heart for it to succeed. In a press meeting, he reiterated, “The United Nations stands ready to support your victim-centric process, and its implementation that meets international standards, and your own Supreme Court’s rulings.”Nepal is committed to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1948 and is a state party to various international human rights instruments, including the Geneva Convention, the Convention on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention against Torture and the Rights of the Child, and other international human rights laws. The authorities cannot ignore these international commitments. Moreover, it has also enacted the National Penal (Code) Act 2017, meeting international obligations enforcing criminal accountability. Embracing TJ’s core valuesEnsuring accountability for serious crimes should not be seen only as victims’ rights but as a legitimate concern for the post-conflict society. This determines the kind of future we are handing over to the next generation. It is time we raised the following questions: Are we building a just society with zero tolerance for impunity and strengthening the rule of law? Does this process that ensures non-repetition and durable peace fall under TJ’s core values? Will it break the culture of deep-rooted political violence? Finally, only seeking political consensus, as in the past, is not a viable solution to this process. The precondition of TJ’s success lies in earning the ‘trust’ of people, especially victims. However, the bill taken as the foundation of the process cannot do so, as the steps taken so far are designed to protect the perpetrators’ interests. In these circumstances, the victim leaders and the civil society involved in ending the process are reluctant to trust the ruling authorities, who have often failed to fulfil their promises.Three global rights organisations, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the International Commission of Jurists, issued a joint statement on Tuesday to ensure the integrity of the process and bring the law in compliance with Nepali and international legal standards. The bill indeed includes positive provisions, but serious accountability gaps must be addressed.  \nThe Constitution of Nepal, as outlined in Article 232, mandates that “relationships between the federation, provinces and local levels be grounded in the principles of cooperation, co-existence and coordination”. Article 235 of the Constitution grants the federal parliament the authority to draft the necessary coordination law to maintain coordination among the federal units. In line with this directive, the “Federation, Province, and Local Level (Coordination and Interrelation) Act, 2020 (2077),” commonly known as the Intergovernmental Relations (IGR) Law, was enacted.The primary purpose of the IGR law is to strengthen the federal system by fostering coordination and cooperation in areas such as law and policy formulation. As Nepal transitioned from a centralised system to a federal structure, laws were critical to facilitate this transition and address people’s aspirations following the new constitution. To bridge this gap and ensure that the newly established three tiers of government function in accordance with the spirit of the constitution, the federal government introduced the IGR law. The law has become one of the most widely discussed pieces of legislation.However, Nepal embraced federalism without fully developing the necessary infrastructure and groundwork for its effective implementation. This decision has led to ongoing challenges, as political parties and their leaders have differing interpretations of federalism from the outset. These differences became apparent soon after the first government was elected in 2017, accompanying the federalism. Despite the constitutional provisions agreed upon by all political parties, implementation has been walking at a snail’s pace, with some provisions still unfulfilled.This has raised concerns, particularly as provincial governments have been demanding their rights from the federal government. Local governments, which had already established their bases and were revived nearly after two decades of dormancy with extensive rights, are now neglected.IGR lawThe implementation of the IGR law has begun, with major provisions gradually coming into effect. However, the process has been hindered by a centralised mindset, sluggish bureaucracy and political meddling.While all federal units have widely accepted the IGR law, the primary concern lies in its effective implementation and the devolution of power. The law’s main objective is to facilitate the implementation of constitutional provisions related to power sharing among the three tiers of government. A detailed analysis reveals that many of the law’s key provisions have only been partially implemented, highlighting the urgent need for a robust mechanism to ensure that all structures envisioned by the law are fully functional.Leaders holding executive positions at the federal level have been reluctant to devolve exclusive powers to the sub-federal levels. This reluctance, driven by a desire to retain power at the federal level, has significantly impeded the proper implementation of constitutional provisions and laws intended to strengthen inter-governmental relations. Additionally, the stakeholders’ lack of ownership has further obstructed the process. For the proper application of the law, all stakeholders must clearly understand its importance.Government officials have often failed to grasp the spirit of the explanatory notes, which outline the principles of coordination, cooperation and co-existence that underpin the IGR. Despite having the necessary legal framework, state organs have not ensured its proper execution. However, the provinces and local levels have shown resilience, refusing to relent, which is a positive aspect.Slow implementationSeveral factors have contributed to the slow implementation of the IGR law. Unstable governments have delayed meetings of Sectoral Thematic Committees, the National Coordination Council (NCC) and the Provincial Coordination Council (PCC), affecting their ability to resolve issues. Frequent changes in government have also disrupted the settings of IGR mechanisms. Additionally, the study of the law has been delayed due to a lack of resources, with employees in the law ministry often juggling dual responsibilities that hinder their work.Local governments are often unaware of many IGR law provisions and lack the resources, technical manpower and skills to implement them fully. The use of non-declarative phrases and sentences, such as “matters to be considered” or “if found necessary,” has weakened the law’s effectiveness.One striking example of such a lack of coordination is the delay of the Kathmandu-Terai fast-track project. It highlights the significant lack of coordination between the three government tiers despite the existence of the IGR law.Addressing coordination issuesA permanent structure at the Office of the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers (OPMCM) is needed to function as the secretariat of the National Coordination Council. This structure should have a strong presence of representatives from sub-federal levels. Currently, the Provincial Coordination Section of the OPMCM handles issues related to the provinces, while the Ministry of Federal Affairs and General Administration manages local-level issues. A single mechanism should be developed to address issues concerning both federal units.Similarly, a mechanism for coordination and consultation at provincial and local levels should be established. Section 4 of the IGR law does not specify which federal body will coordinate with provinces and local levels while formulating laws and policies on exclusive and concurrent power matters. A coordination and consultation mechanism should be developed at the federal level, as the legislature has the sole authority to make laws, and the government prepares the first draft of bills.The Intergovernmental Fiscal Council was established under the Intergovernmental Fiscal Arrangement Act of 2017 to resolve fiscal issues between federal units. Since the council is more inclusive, functional and effective, the representation model used in the Sectoral Thematic Committees should be similar to that outlined in the Fiscal Council law. Having at least one local representative from each province could help raise and resolve their issues.The Provincial Coordination Council should be made more inclusive, with increased representation from local levels. This would ensure that the new mechanism represents all local levels. Compared to the initial one, the existing provision is regressive. A series of information-sharing programmes should also be conducted among federal units to educate them on the IGR law and federalism. The Federalism Implementation Special Committee of the National Assembly has urged the government to launch a broad awareness campaign from the grassroots to the federal level. Targeted training and orientation sessions at all local levels are essential to inform stakeholders about the law’s provisions and implications.Other things include resource management, skilled human resources and logistics management. These would prove beneficial in addressing the coordination issues in our federal structure. \nIn June, when the Cabinet decided to make National Identity Card (NID) mandatory for accessing government services, including social security allowances, it was widely criticised, with even federal lawmakers voicing their disapproval. The Home Ministry had announced that the directive would be enforced in 28 districts, setting a deadline of mid-July. This decision had “terrorised people”, as they feared they would be deprived of social security services, and many registered in haste.But the government last month decided to overturn the directive with equal haste. Now, the Nepalis are left confused: To obtain it or not to obtain it? Seemingly disbelieving the government's changing position on the use of the NID, over half a million people opted for it between mid-June to mid-July. Yet, there is little information about whether the government has worked out the behind-the-scenes procedures for its proper utility. Despite the NID’s design to combine important identity cards and documents including driving licenses, academic documents, voting cards, insurance details, and ATM card numbers in a single chip, implementing agencies still lack the infrastructure for such an endeavour. This technological hurdle adds to the already challenging task of fully executing the NID card campaign six years after the government started distributing it. Moreover, the hubbub surrounding the NID’s “revolutionary” function has proven to be dubious—it is either of no use or is imposed arbitrarily on the people. This is a prime example of how our authorities care not to think about its citizens' comfort or welfare when they come up with new policies or schemes. The authorities' main argument for implementing the NID is that it will be a one-stop solution for surveilling and controlling criminal activities like financial fraud by removing duplication. Article 51 of the Constitution of Nepal 2015 pledges to develop an integrated national identity management information system and manage citizens' data. The NID and Registration Act 2020 states that personal privacy would be ensured in its usage. But experts believe the document has several loopholes as it does not discuss data protection. Sensitive data and information of the citizens are the nation's assets, and they must be safeguarded diligently. However, the government is yet to fully assure citizens about data privacy; what is working in the government’s favour is that many lack digital literacy enough to know about their privacy rights. Moreover, the government has not clearly explained how it plans to segregate information access by multiple agencies, as the NID provides an integrated database of different information. This paints a murky picture of Nepal’s cyber security ecosystem, as data security is fragile, and hackers often target government websites. Ever since the launch of the Adhaar Card in India, there have been numerous cases of duping, misuse and information leak. The government must learn from the mistakes of its next-door neighbour before launching a “grand” campaign to digitalise identification. The government would do well to return to the basics before taking any further steps and clearly address the concerns of experts, lawmakers and citizens about why and how the card is an important addition to other identifications like citizenship, driving license, and passport. Moreover, the authorities should first ideate on the utility, functionality and safety of the NID before imposing it on the citizens.  \nNepal’s biggest fears are coming true: Climate change-induced disasters are here. The recent catastrophic “rare flood” in Thame village in Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Rural Municipality is a case in point. Last week, the swollen Thame River reportedly destroyed 20 houses and an elementary school and displaced 135 residents of the village. Two of the five small glacial lakes formed above the settlement burst, causing a glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF). GLOF occurs when a glacial lake breaches its natural dam called moraine—a pile of debris left behind by a glacier. The Thame incident has again centred people’s attention on mountains and climate change. We cannot help but remember a 2020 report by the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), which warned that 47 glacial lakes in Nepal, China and India are at high risk of bursting, 21 of them from Nepal alone. As alarming is the organisation’s 2023 report, which projects a threefold rise in GLOF risks across the Hindu-Kush Himalayas by the end of this century and peak GLOF dangers expected by 2050. These warnings should be enough for us to be serious about this matter. Such a crisis has been looming over us for a long time now, but our efforts to mitigate climate risks are far from adequate. Nepal has already witnessed 24 GLOFs, yet there aren’t enough disaster preparedness programmes, prevention methods, comprehensive risk mapping and risk assessments in place. The politicians’ priorities, primarily focused on filling their coffers and racing towards premiership, have not only neglected such grave issues but also amplified them. We cannot wait for another disaster to devastate lives and properties before we take action.GLOFs, with the right interventions, are not insurmountable, according to experts. We needn’t look far to understand how human intervention can lessen the risks of glacial lakes. Take Imja Glacial Lake in the Everest Region and Tso Rolpa in Dolakha, for instance. In 2016, the Nepal Army lowered the water level of Imja Lake by building an exit channel for excessive water and, in 2000, the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology lowered the water level in Tso Rolpa by three metres. These interventions were costly but protected thousands of people living in the settlements downward. Such efforts must also be scaled up in other high-risk lakes, and monitoring teams and early warning systems should be administered in such areas. Our authorities should immediately emulate such successful practices to reduce the severity of GLOFs. We have the opportunity to discuss the crisis in the upcoming COP29 and lobby for a significant share of Loss and Damage Funds. The minimal funds the government allocates for climate change-related issues can never cover the severity we face. Developed countries and international organisations are duty bound to help Nepal with adaptation and mitigation strategies, apart from supporting risk assessments of GLOFs. As climate change has harmed us in ways that are both profound and perilous, the general public should also realise their roles in escalating the climate crisis and vow to lessen it by switching to environment-friendly practices. We have no other option but to commit to urgent and joint actions to save the future of our planet. \nChhabilal Dahal aka Pushpa Kamal aka Bishwas aka Prachanda has been a champion of change all his life—starting with his own name(s) to the political system. He loathes historical continuities and strives for ruptures—agragami chhalang, as he so enthusiastically pronounced in his initial days in parliamentary politics post the 2006 political changes. In fact, he chased change even as a young political leader of the Nepal Communist Party (Mashal), having changed several parties and factions before finally replacing his seniors and mentors to lead the party in 1989. But after three-and-a-half decades of being the party chief, he has no fascination for change—at least when it comes to leadership change in his party.As the CPN (Maoist-Centre)—as the party is now called after several name changes over the past decade-and-a-half, struggles to stay relevant in the aftermath of its ouster from the coalition with the CPN-UML, the question of leadership change has become prominent once again. In earlier times, anyone who talked of change in the party's leadership, strategies or ideological standpoints would be forced to leave the party altogether—Mohan Baidya, Baburam Bhattarai and Netra Bikram Chand are in case. Dahal continued to maintain his tight grip over the party even if that meant things falling apart in the party. Prachanda, the fierce one, needed to show he was the boss.This time around, Janardan Sharma is leading the band of those questioning Dahal's relevance as party chair or calling on him to hand over party leadership to younger leaders. As expected, Dahal's hardline supporters are worried that any discussion about changing leadership now, when the party is at its weakest since its resurgence in parliamentary politics in the mid-2000s, damages the party further. But Dahal's interlocutor himself has claimed that his calls for leadership change are aimed at ensuring that Dahal’s \"revolutionary\" contributions to Nepali politics last long. For Dahal to leave a lasting legacy as a changemaker, Sharma argues, he should step aside and make way for the new generation leaders within the party.Sharma isn't wrong in this regard. After all, how long can a party remain relevant under a single leader? Indeed, there must be a saturation point somewhere, and the Maoist Party seems to have gone past that point. From its heyday as the single-largest party, with 220 seats in the 601-strong first Constituent Assembly to a distant third with just 23 seats in the 275-strong Parliament, the Maoist Centre has been on a downward spiral for quite long now. And with coalition change for making and breaking governments seemingly being the only definition of change for the party now, there are obvious misgivings about Dahal's leadership. Moreover, with the recent breakthrough in the Transitional Justice Act, there are new hopes for a fairly acceptable, if not entirely successful, culmination of the peace process. A post-peace Nepal would certainly seek a new dispensation across political parties. Perhaps it is time for the Maoist Centre to realise that Dahal's alternative as party chair will be found only when it starts looking for one. \nCPN (Unified Socialist) leader Ram Kumari Jhakri, involved in the party's formation in 2021, now advocates for a merger with the CPN-UML, attributing the inability of Unified Socialist to perform well to domination by old leaders, lack of clear policy, and unresponsiveness to UML overtures.\nThe Maoist Centre, led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal, has recently been ousted from the government and is now discussing its strategy after reviewing national and international events, including the proposed constitutional amendments by the new ruling coalition, external influences, and the possibility of party unification.\nWater resources expert Ajaya Dixit highlights the rampant encroachment and pollution of rivers in Nepal, particularly in urban areas, due to outdated river management practices and urban development that disregards water bodies. He proposes integrated knowledge systems, interdisciplinary approaches, and citizen initiatives to restore and protect rivers, emphasizing the importance of recognizing cities as waterscapes and addressing the challenges posed by squatters.\nDespite initial agreement, doubts linger over the longevity of the Congress-UML alliance, fueled by skepticism about implementation and the parties' past records, although some economic improvements are anticipated.\nNepal faces monsoon-induced disasters, and the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology is working to improve forecasting using real-time data, satellite images, and collaborations to save lives, despite challenges posed by topography and climate change.\nFriday's forecast predicts cloudy skies, rain in most provinces (heavy in Bagmati and Lumbini), and similar conditions on Friday night, with additional heavy rain possible in Koshi province.\nThe Meteorological Forecasting Division has predicted widespread rain and thunderstorms across the country on Thursday.Throughout the day, the weather will be generally cloudy nationwide, with light to moderate rain accompanied by thunder and lightning expected in many regions. Heavy rainfall is likely in some areas of Koshi, Madhesh, and Sudurpaschim provinces. Other parts of the country may also experience rain, though it is expected to be less intense.The division noted that similar weather patterns will persist into the night, with heavy rainfall expected at one or two places in Koshi and Madhesh provinces. The rest of the country will remain partly to generally cloudy, with chances of light to moderate rain and thunderstorms in multiple regions, including Bagmati, Gandaki, Lumbini, and Sudurpaschim provinces.The division said that the monsoon trough, a low-pressure system, is currently influencing weather patterns across the country. The trough is positioned slightly north of its average location in the eastern part of the country, while it remains in its typical position in the west.On Wednesday, the highest recorded temperature was in Biratnagar at 33.9°C, while the lowest was in Jomsom at 15°C.

Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nRastriya Swatantra Party Chairman Rabi Lamichhane has denied having any role in handling the finances of the Gorkha Media Network as its managing director. Responding to over four dozen questions from lawmakers of the parliamentary committee investigating fraud involving various cooperatives, Lamichhane pointed the finger at Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai, then chairperson of the media network. To every question related to financial dealings, he answered he was not aware, according to the lawmakers who quizzed him. Lamichhane, former deputy prime minister and the minister for home affairs, was summoned by the parliamentary committee in the capacity of the executive director at the media network.“Lamichhane said it was GB Rai who oversaw the financial part including loans and other expenditures,” said Surya Thapa, chairperson of the parliamentary panel. “He claimed his role was limited to day-to-day administrative works and production and management of television programmes.”Lamichhane was invited to the 45th meeting of the committee whose tenure ends next week. Stating that he received a 15 percent share in the media network as sweat equity, he reiterated that he had not made any investment there. According to Sarita Bhusal, a member of the committee, Lamichhanec said he cannot be held responsible for the loans the media network received from the different cooperatives because it was Rai who managed the finances.“He claimed that there are no signatures, citizenship details or other official documents attached to the loan papers for releasing money from Suryadarshan, Supreme, Sahara or Swarnalaxmi cooperatives to the media network,” said Bhusal. Lamichhane has been making similar claims in public ever since he was linked to the cooperative scam.Starting at 4 in the afternoon, the question-answer with Lamichhane lasted almost six hours into the night. He shifted the blame to Rai for every question related to money. Prior to Lamichhane, the probe panel had quizzed Chhabilal Joshi, a founder of the news network. Both are accused of funnelling cooperative funds to the now defunct media company that operated Galaxy 4K television.On Sunday, the parliamentary committee recorded the statement of Bipin Acharya, deputy general secretary of the Lamichhane-led party. Acharya, who was creative director of the Gorkha Media Network, is also alleged to have been involved in embezzling funds from multiple cooperatives established under the leadership of Rai.Although Parliament had found that over Rs120 million was deposited to his account from different cooperatives, Acharya claimed he was unaware of it. The pattern of answers from Lamichhane and Archarya was strikingly similar, a member of the House committee said.The seven-strong House committee was formed on May 28 following demands from then-main opposition Nepali Congress. It was given three months to accomplish the task. Before Lamichhane, the probe panel had already interrogated 29 individuals involved in cooperatives frauds. It has already questioned Sudhir Basnet, who chaired Oriental Cooperatives; former lawmaker Ichchha Raj Tamang, who was the chair at Civil Cooperatives; and Krishna Bahadur Upreti, chair of Ideal Namuna Cooperatives, to its meetings and interrogated them on the issue. All of them are in custody.Additionally, police have summoned Kumar Ramtel, Bhabeshwar Aryal, Shiva Kumar Gurung, and Kalpana Shrestha of the Pokhara-based Suryadarshan Cooperatives for interrogation. They were brought from the custody in Pokhara to Kathmandu for the purpose.Om Prakash Gurung, chair of the Supreme Cooperatives, Butwal, was also brought to Kathmandu from Bhairahawa Prison.The committee also interrogated Dipesh Kumar Pun, the former secretary of the Supreme Cooperatives, Butwal. Pun is the son of former Vice President Nanda Bahadur Pun. The Thapa-led committee has the authority to investigate alleged scams in 29 credit cooperatives. Of them, 20 have been listed as crisis-ridden by the government while nine others are linked to the media network. Ideal Yamuna Multipurpose Cooperative, Image Saving and Credit Cooperative, Sahara Saving and Cooperative, Samanta Saving and Credit Cooperative and Sano Paila Saving and Credit Cooperative had allegedly injected money into the media network. The other four connected to the media network are Supreme Saving and Credit Cooperative, Suryadarshan Saving and Credit Cooperative, Sumeru Saving and Credit Cooperative, and Swarnalaxmi Saving and Credit Cooperative. The parliamentary committee has five days to wrap up its investigation. \nLast week, doctors at Thapathali-based Paropakar Maternity and Women’s Hospital diagnosed a new mother in her late 20s with postnatal depression. Her newborn baby was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit of the hospital due to health complications, and the mother was under care in the maternity ward.“We had to start her on anti-depressants, as she was showing serious symptoms, including suicidal thoughts,” said Dr Pratikshya Ghimire, a psychiatrist at the hospital. “She felt sad all the time, worried about the newborn's future, and had lost her appetite.” Mental health problems during pregnancy are the second leading cause of maternal deaths, after excessive bleeding during childbirth, also known as postpartum haemorrhage, and pre-eclampsia [pregnancy-related high blood pressure disorders. A report on maternal mortality unveiled last year by the National Statistics Office showed that six percent of maternal deaths were due to self-harm (suicide), with most cases occurring during pregnancy.To address mental health problems during pregnancy, the Ministry of Health and Population has started outpatient care services at the Maternity Hospital.“We have not only started outpatient care but also begun screening inpatients for mental health conditions,” said Dr Ghimire. “We have diagnosed around a dozen and a half patients with serious mental health problems.”According to Dr Ghimire, the woman had an inter-caste marriage, and neither her in-laws nor her own parents accepted her marriage, contributing to her mental health struggles. Several other pregnant women and new mothers have also been found suffering from mental health problems, each at various stages of severity.“The Health Ministry had deputed one psychiatric doctor to our hospital, and we started offering outpatient services after her arrival,” said Dr Shree Prasad Adhikari, the hospital's director. “We are also working on training all hospital staff in mental health screening so that conditions can be diagnosed early. Once mental health problems are identified, patients can be referred to specialists.”Officials hope that screening pregnant women for mental health problems and providing prompt treatment will help reduce maternal deaths, which have been rising alarmingly of late.Doctors say prenatal and postnatal depression can occur at any time during pregnancy or after childbirth. Shifts in hormone levels during pregnancy and after childbirth can significantly affect mood. Many women feel anxious about changes happening to their bodies. Some may even have financial concerns and some worry about taking on new and additional responsibilities.Some women experience extreme sadness, anxiety, fatigue, and changes in sleeping and eating habits during pregnancy or after childbirth. Experts warn that prenatal and postnatal depression along with anxiety and other mental health issues, can lead some women to take their own lives.They also emphasise that excessive bleeding after childbirth, also known as postpartum haemorrhage, pre-eclampsia (pregnancy-related high blood pressure disorders), and suicide are preventable. “Timely screening for mental health problems and proper counselling can significantly reduce the mental health problems faced by pregnant women and new mothers,” said Adhikari. “We have launched this initiative at our hospital, and this is something other hospitals should also implement.”Nepal reduced the maternal mortality rate from 539 per 100,000 births in 1996 to 239 per 100,000 births in 2016. For this, the country also received a Millennium Development Goals award. The 2021 census report showed that in every 100,000 live births, 151 women died from maternity-related complications. According to the report, 88 maternal deaths were prevented in every 100,000 live births between 2016 and 2021. Nepal’s target under the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals is to reduce the maternal mortality rate to 75 per 100,000 births by 2030. \nForeign Minister Arzu Rana, who returned on Thursday after completing a five-day official visit to India, has said that New Delhi’s response to the new government in Nepal was positive.“Based on my discussion with Indian leaders and officials, India’s response and reaction to the new government constituted by two major political parties [in Nepal] was positive and good,” Rana said, briefing the party’s ongoing central working committee meeting on Friday on her interactions in New Delhi.Rana paid an official visit to India from August 18 to 22, during which she called on Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and held bilateral talks with her Indian counterpart, S Jaishankar. She also met with other leaders and officials during her stay and regular health checkups in New Delhi.“We were curious about India’s response to the formation of the new government in Nepal,” she told the Nepali Congress committee. “Let me inform you that India’s response and reaction were good and positive.”About her meeting with Indian Prime Minister Modi, she said, “I met with Modi ji, who said India viewed the new government [in Nepal] as a positive development. I handed the invitation from our prime minister to Modi ji.” Rana also briefed her party on the recent arrivals of delegations from China and the United States of America. Deputy Secretary of State for Management and Resources Richard Verma paid a two-day visit to Kathmandu last week, announcing an additional $100 million in US military aid to Nepal, subject to Congressional approval and the availability of funds.The foreign minister said the US side communicated that it would provide two more helicopters and two struts to the Nepal Army, which will be used for disaster response. Similarly from China, Yang Weiqun, vice-chairman of the China International Development Cooperation Agency (CIDCA), is on a Nepal visit. He met Rana on Friday.“Both Modi ji and Jaishankar ji assured me about India’s continued support for Nepal’s development endeavours,” Rana said on Friday, adding that her India visit was successful for several reasons. “During my meetings with Indian leaders, I communicated to them that Nepal’s peace process is headed in the positive direction with the parties agreeing on transitional justice law amendments, which is a positive outcome achieved after the formation of the new government.”Rana said that Nepal and India had discussed several matters related to mutual interest and agreed to activate bilateral mechanisms. Soon, there will be a meeting of the Joint Commission on inundation and flood control.“We received a letter from the Indian side on Friday,” Rana told the meeting. “My visit played a pivotal role in building trust between the two sides.”“During my meeting with Modi ji and Jaishankar ji, I expressed Nepal’s concerns and interests. The visit has opened the line of communication at the highest level and at different levels to provide future direction for our cooperation and partnership,” according to a statement issued by Rana’s private secretariat.“During my meeting with Minister Jaishankar, we discussed issues such as energy cooperation, trade and transit, connectivity, investment, air routes, infrastructure development, floods and inundations, the Pancheshwar Multipurpose Project, sports, and infrastructure in the bordering areas,” she said. “To address several issues between Nepal and India, we also agreed to activate bilateral mechanisms.” Rana also briefed the party on her meeting with Yang, the vice-chairman of CIDCA, China’s external aid agency. The Chinese official looking after China’s external aid regime wants to know Nepal’s position on the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).Nepal and China signed the BRI framework agreement in 2017, but not a single project has been executed under it so far. The Chinese side unilaterally announced some projects under the BRI framework, but the government of Nepal has yet to recognise them.A Congress leader said Rana had explained her party's position on BRI during her meeting with the CIDCA vice-chairman, but she did not mention the government's position on BRI.The government has not discussed much about the BRI and its funding modality in Nepal. “Rana told Yang that our party has a clear position on BRI that we cannot afford a loan, so our preference would be grants, and if needed to take the loan, we will go for a soft loan equal to the interest rate of the World Bank, Asian Development Bank or any other global lender.” On Thursday, four different letters of exchange were signed between Nepal and China to carry out the four projects which will be built with Chinese grants.Four different letters were exchanged to upgrade the 8.2-kilometre Kalanki-Maharajgunj Ring Road, build an Integrated Check Post (ICP) and an Inland Container Depot (ICD) at Korala in Mustang, and conduct a feasibility study for repairing and maintaining the Araniko Highway. \nIndia and Bhutan progressed into the semi-finals of the SAFF U-20 Championship from Group B after the Blue Tigers defeated the Maldives 1-0 in their final group match at the ANFA Complex in Satdobato on Friday.Manglenthang Kipgen scored in the fifth minute of the stoppage time for India.The outcome means, India topped Group B with six points and will face Group A runners-up Bangladesh in the semi-finals.Bhutan, on three points, qualified as group runners-up. The Maldives exited the competition after two straight losses.Bhutan’s semi-final opponents will be hosts Nepal, who won Group A after defeating both their opponents Bangladesh and Sri Lanka in the group stage.The Maldives were in a must win situation following their 2-1 loss against Bhutan but could not really threaten India, who needed only a draw, throughout the game. Maldives goalkeeper Mohamed Yaameen was perhaps the busiest on the pitch, keeping the frequent Indian attack at bay and making up for defending mistakes.But India, too, were not at their best and wasteful on many occasions.India should have taken the lead early when Maldives defender Mohamed Aiham Anwar’s poor attempt to clear a cross from Korou Singh Thingu fell in the path of Monirul Molla, who only needed to tap but failed to capitalise on the opportunity.India had another clear chance in the 22nd minute. Thingu was the creator again as he sprinted towards the opposition half, cut inside and set up for Molla but Maldives goalie Yaameen came to the rescue with a quick reflex save.The Maldives built up some pressure after the break but could never trouble the Indian goalkeeper Priyansh Dubey.India came close to goal in the 78th minute when Mohamed Aiham Anwar and Ahmed Nawaf Fauzy failed to clear a cross from Ricky Meetei Haobam but Yameen kept the Maldives breathing with his quick thinking.It was all India in the final minutes and Yaameen had to come to rescue for defending mistakes twice.But the goalie was finally undone by Kipgen, whose low shot from outside the area managed to sneak into the bottom corner despite a full-stretch effort from Yaameen. \nNepali TikTok users will need to wait a few days more to use the social media app despite the government lifting the ban. On Thursday, the government lifted the TikTok ban after nine months.“TikTok will resume once the company formally applies for company registration and starts working on the conditions set by the Nepal government,” said Gajendra Thakur, spokesperson for the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology.“A meeting was held on Friday at the ministry with the TikTok vice president. The TikTok delegation has committed to accept all the government conditions,” said Thakur.“We have received the Cabinet’s decision. We will now write to the Nepal Telecommunications Authority to allow TikTok after the company completes all the government-mandated processes.”Only the authority can allow the resumption of service, according to directions from the communication ministry. The service providers need to wait for the authority’s notice for service to resume on their networks.Pradip Paudyal, deputy director of the Nepal Telecommunications Authority, the telecom regulator, said they have yet to receive the ministry’s letter.The government has given ByteDance, TikTok’s parent company, a three-month deadline to comply with certain terms and conditions.Responding to the government's decision to lift the ban, TikTok issued a statement on Friday saying the government had opened the door for economic opportunity for creators and would support enabling Nepali voices and creativity.“We're pleased that TikTok has been unblocked in Nepal. We appreciate the government of Nepal's commitment to ongoing productive dialogue and recognise their care for the Nepali community's digital experience, \" TikTok stated.“The creativity and passion of our community have brought joy to households across Nepal and opened vital economic opportunities to incredibly talented creators and businesses. We're excited to be able to continue enabling Nepali voices and creativity as we work to support the success story of Nepal.”On November 13, then-prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government banned TikTok, citing its adverse effects on social harmony.However, the KP Sharma Oli administration allowed TikTok to operate with several regulatory changes.According to the conditions, TikTok, from now onwards, has to help promote Nepal's tourism, invest in digital literacy efforts, support and uplift Nepal's public education system and filter content on its platform.Earlier, TikTok sent several letters to the Nepal government requesting the ban be lifted.In the letter, TikTok said that the ban was causing financial losses to the company and the country.The government restricted TikTok after introducing the ‘Directives on the Operation of Social Networking 2023’ in November last year.The directives made it mandatory for social media sites such as Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), TikTok, and YouTube to open liaison offices in Nepal.The government said the measure was introduced because an increasing number of people complained that the absence of the companies’ representatives in Nepal made it difficult for the authorities to address their users’ concerns and even remove objectionable content from the platforms.Internet service providers said that TikTok accounts for nearly 40 percent of internet bandwidth consumption in Nepal. When it is banned, internet consumption does not decline as users switch to virtual private networks (VPN).Before the ban, there were around 2.2 million TikTok users in Nepal. \nOur roads are becoming increasingly unsafe due to poor and haphazard construction, natural disasters. But more often than not, it is because our drivers are overworked, and there is hardly any solid monitoring mechanism in place to check their physical and mental status. Providing resting time for drivers becomes even more crucial during monsoons, when landslides obstruct roads and the journeys become longer.Realising the need to provide drivers with resting time and place, the Lumbini Province Government started building five “smart refresh centres” in Bardaghat in Nawalparasi West, Sainamaina in Rupandehi, Chandrauta in Kapilvastu, Lamahi in Dang, and Bardiya along the East-West Highway four years ago. These centres promise washrooms, eateries, restrooms, shower rooms, charging stations, parking area, among other amenities, to help drivers and passengers tackle fatigue during long-distance travels. However, due to budget constraints, the project hasn’t seen the light of day yet. While the idea of starting the refresh centres is laudable, there is a clear lack of coordination among political parties to complete the project. The ambitious project took shape in Lumbini during the CPN-UML government when it set aside around Rs110 million. But the government was ousted even as it began construction work, and the new government, led by the Maiosts, slashed the budget for the project. The project got shelved by subsequent governments. Even though the first phase of the project (only the construction of the building) has been completed in Sainamaina, its operation has been halted as it lacks proper guidelines for functioning. The experiment in Lumbini has been a failed project.Nepal’s Motor Vehicle and Transport Management Act mandates drivers to rest after six hours of driving. However, the authorities have failed to enforce the rules, let alone arrange proper rest areas for the drivers. Safer roads not only improve road safety but also help the country's tourism flourish. As we strive to expand our tourism agenda by attracting more tourists, the importance of ensuring basic resting facilities along the highways cannot be overstated. Providing the best services for tourists will attract them to the country, thereby boosting our economy and buttressing international reputation. While it is encouraging that several other provinces have rest centres along highways, the conditions are far from decent. Most of these centres lack basic sanitary and hygiene services. Moreover, such small projects lack sufficient construction as well as maintenance funds, as has been the case in Lumbini. The governments’ tendency to consider them “trivial” is equally concerning. Such a mindset not only hinders our journey towards making roads safer but also other opportunities that come along with it, including tourism promotion and passenger satisfaction. As highway accidents become a regular phenomenon in Nepal, we need more smart refresh centres. The federal government should therefore come on board and help provincial and local governments construct these centres through enough budget allocation on need basis. It is also necessary to devise a plan to maintain and renovate existing ones that lack enough amenities for drivers and passengers. Meanwhile, political parties should heed the projects that are in the best interests of people, and not weigh them on the basis of whether they fall under their party’s priority or not. \nDemocracy can be both vulnerable and endurable. Vulnerability arises from governance crises, elites’ incompatibility with basic democratic rule, and all kinds of human frailties developed by rulers’ irrational behaviours and myopic decisions. Commonly, resistance to misrule and elected leaders’ absurdities create conditions for systemic and extra-systemic changes or revolutions. The crisis of legitimacy in all its manifestations works against the longevity of governments. Apart from the electoral legitimacy that helps form a government, psychological legitimacy, a part of performance legitimacy, makes situations more fertile for mass rebellion.Small incidents or faulty decisions the leaders make prepare grounds for major upheavals. Bangladesh’s latest event shows how a government elected a few months ago could face the wrath of students and people. They revolted against the Sheikh Hasina government’s decision to implement the 30 percent reservation quota for the children of liberation fighters—Muktibahinini, perceived as the Awami League Party members.Legitimacy crisisPolitical awareness has both positive and negative sides. A ruler’s positive picture provides governmental stability, whereas an egregious picture fuels instability. Popular consciousness holds governments accountable. Any democratic government that ignores widespread sensitivity and rights loses its moral ground. Thomas Hill Green, a political philosopher, writes, “Human consciousness postulates liberty, liberty involves rights, rights demand the state”. According to him, the state is organic to the elements of consciousness and rights, and the state must “hinder the hindrances” that come in the way of liberty. John Locke, much before Green, gave people the right to revolt if the government failed to be legitimate and responsible for protecting their rights. Thus, democracy is as attractive a concept and practice as it is impregnated with seeds of movement. Holding periodic elections, along with the design of power separation, is for controlling disruption or breakdown of government or even the political system. Elections, too, demand people’s consciousness because they are expected to circulate elites to provide a safety valve for the system. If different methods and excuses plunder the elections, the scope for extreme actions becomes inevitable. Many instances in South Asia, Latin America and Africa have proved that legitimacy claimed on the grounds of electoral victory alone is weird, as people rise to revolt sooner or later if leaders fail to be sensitive. A few days ago, the Colombian president was forced to resign when his legitimacy grounds became suspect. Democracy contains the sparkle of fire that needs to be carefully handled. Movements are violent and non-violent, and their methods vary depending on their very nature. Democracy produced by violent upheavals is short-lived, as it is fraught with uncertain elements and is not conducive to the smooth functioning of a political system. Moreover, in countries where rulers and systems are organic to each other—arguing that one is exclusive to the other—the fall of rulers would also be the fall of the regime. In Nepal, the monarchy was identified with the regime's endurance created by the king. When people revolted against the regime, the monarchy became weak despite the king’s confidence that his grip on power would not dwindle, even when the people rejected the Panchayat system. As King Gyanendra failed to fathom the anger and resentment of people against his authoritarian proclivities, both the monarchy and the regime collapsed.South Asian democratic crisesIn Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, people involved in the movement seemed to be sensitive to the cause of democracy. In addition to rooting out the system, they also didn’t allow the army to wield power after the ouster of leaders Sheikh Hasina and Gotabaya Rajapaksha. They soon displayed their maturity in realising the need for communal harmony and peace despite the vandalisation of Hindu temples and houses of minority communities in Bangladesh. The choice of a scholar, Professor Muhammad Yunus, in spite of his animosity with Hasina, augured well from a democratic point of view. Bangladesh, like Sri Lanka, is expected to return to electoral politics and maintain constitutional order soon. However, the agitators and other parties must learn a lesson: Winning elections by foul means would be dangerous. Hasina’s greatest failure was to concentrate power in her own hands, depriving her political rivals of the fight for election. She used draconian methods to decimate opposition. Her decent track record of faster economic development, making Bangladesh a development model for South Asia, has been overshadowed by her authoritarian governance style. Nevertheless, Hasina’s party is likely to continue to be a significant force because of its long history and tradition, which gave birth to the Republic of Bangladesh. South Asian countries, in general, have demonstrated that any form of authoritarian dictatorship is not a substitute for democracy. The military in Pakistan might have continued to play politics from behind; there, too, the civilian’s share of power is not absent. However, it is assumed that in any system, democratic or authoritarian, the military, which is one of the core elements of national security, shows its influence in politics. Although the elected government is supreme in India, it has to consult the army while making vital security decisions. In South Asia, democracy suffers from parties and politicians whose minimum moral standards are blurred, causing them to be highly self-centred and parochial in running the system. In Nepal, bad image projections of leaders are fraught with the danger of being overturned by quick events, as in the past. People easily link external factors with political upheavals in countries of the region. However, the governance crisis and negative image of leaders seem crucial for electoral defeats or government toppling. Hasina’s allegation that the US was behind the movement against her is untenable, despite her not-too-friendly relationship with the country. Her view that the US wanted to use St Martin’s Island and the Bay of Bengal for security purposes lacks veracity and cannot be the sole reason for her ouster. It is a truism that rulers generally try to find fault with foreigners when they are under pressure at home or are overthrown by popular movements.  \nThe incident occurred on August 9, 2024, hours after crowds in India and Pakistan cheered on their respective contenders for the javelin gold in Paris. Just like in most places in the subcontinent, on the night of August 8, on-duty doctors at the RG Kar Hospital in Kolkata in India were also watching Arshad Nadeem and Niraj Chopra compete against each other. A lot was at stake and India was the favourite. We all know what happened in the competition, as Pakistan won its first individual Olympic gold medal.However, nobody, it seems, knows what happened at the RG Kar Hospital. It has been two weeks since the news broke that a trainee doctor who was on duty that night was brutally raped and killed in the early hours of August 9. Ever since then, Kolkata and many other Indian cities have been in a state of turmoil. Out-Patient Department services have been suspended in several hospitals in the country and questions are being raised about how such a brutal crime could have taken place in a fully staffed hospital.According to news reports, the second-year resident was completing a 36-hour shift at the hospital and was attacked while she was apparently resting in a seminar room. The doctor’s parents were not called until much later. They were first informed in a telephone call that their daughter was very sick. They were later told that their daughter had died by suicide. When the shocked and panicked parents arrived at the hospital, they were prevented from seeing their daughter’s body for four hours.When finally they were allowed to see their child’s body, they saw that she had been beaten and badly bruised. The glass from her spectacles had been smashed on her face and even her eyes were bleeding from the shards. The postmortem report, that hinted at gang-rape, was horrifying, and said that the victim had been strangled to death. Suspecting a move to destroy evidence, the father of the rape victim questioned the haste with which the body of his child was cremated.The incident is brutal and horrifying and it brings to the fore a safety problem that has also been faced by working women in Pakistan. Doctors, including women doctors, work long hours in very difficult circumstances—whether they are at the understaffed wards at government hospitals in the cities or in far-flung areas where amenities are few and living conditions difficult.Doctors, including those with labour-room responsibilities, have to work at all hours of the day and night and may be singlehandedly responsible for dozens of patients at the same time. The situation is made more complicated by the fact that patients are often accompanied by entire crews of family members. If something goes awry or the patient passes away, one doctor is left to face a crowd of angry family members. While such a situation can be faced by both male and female doctors, the latter category is more vulnerable in a patriarchal society, where misogyny and gender discrimination are par for the course.Medical premises in Pakistan are often not equipped with safe and adequate facilities for female doctors whether these are bathrooms or rooms where female medical staff working long hours can rest safely. This means that women doctors, who are already a target of aggression in the wards, are unable to feel safe even outside them.In the Kolkata case, the person who has been arrested was a civilian police volunteer, who appears to have had easy access to all parts of the hospital. The same conditions apply to many hospitals in Pakistan where people have easy access to all parts of medical premises, thus posing a potential threat to women doctors and nurses.It is understandable why the medical community in India is on the streets protesting against the rape and the conditions that led to it. Unsurprisingly, as time passes, the matter is being given a political colour because the ruling Modi administration—which has done nothing to make working conditions safe for women in the country—wants to undermine the state government in West Bengal whose capital Kolkata is. However, the issue is not one of politics or the government’s ineptitude but rather a wider culture of patriarchal violence in the entire subcontinent. The fact is that women are routinely targeted, raped and forgotten in all of South Asia. Men commit these crimes because they know that most of the time they will get away with it; in fact, there will be no consequences whatsoever.One ridiculous solution that someone offered in the Kolkata case is that women doctors should not be permitted to do night duty at all. This solution seeks to further punish women who have already been held back for centuries for a variety of flawed reasons, including the belief that allowing them independence would compromise their safety vis-à-vis men with uncontrollable bestial instincts.If women anywhere in South Asia are to be safe, this kind of thinking needs to go. The root of the problem—men with depraved thoughts and capable of expressing these in the most horrific way—has to be addressed. The young doctor in Kolkata was saving lives in an under-resourced environment and at an hour where only medics can save you. For this, she suffered in the most despicable way.The brutality and the horror reveal just how inhuman South Asia has become, with men who commit such crimes and men who ignore their occurrence in the workplace and their homes. If there is any hope, it is in the women who are marching to demand their very basic right of being able to do their job without facing threats of rape, violence and death.-Dawn (Pakistan)/ANN \nThe energy sector remained one of Nepal’s most vibrant sectors for over a year. Some encouraging news brightened the country’s mood even as the overall economy remained stagnant. In June last year, Nepal and India inked a long-term power trade agreement, whereby the southern neighbour would import 10,000 MW of hydroelectricity from Nepal in 10 years. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi made the announcement at a joint press meet with Nepali counterpart Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who was on a visit to India. Based on the same deal, India has been gradually increasing the quantum of energy it is importing from Nepal. On Monday, New Delhi approved a plan to import an additional 251 MW of electricity from Nepal, increasing the total imports to nearly 1,000 MW. Nepal, which was heavily dependent on India’s electricity until a few years ago, became a net exporter of electricity last fiscal. Encouraged by the potential market in India and other neighbouring countries including Bangladesh, investors have been injecting huge investments in this sector. Work to build transmission lines and substations has picked up in recent months. Nepal and Bangladesh were all set to sign an agreement last month on the export of Nepal’s 40 MW of electricity via India, only to be cancelled due to political unrest in the South Asian nation. Even as Nepal makes great strides in electricity production and exports, our villages still remain unelectrified. According to the Nepal Electricity Authority’s latest report, 18 of the country’s 753 local government units are not connected to the national grid. According to the NEA report published on Tuesday, 1 percent of the total population is still deprived of the basic facility. Even in the rest of the parts of the country covered by the national grid, electricity supply is still erratic. Moreover, while the import of electric vehicles (EVs) is rising, exhibiting a keen interest among Nepalis to switch from fossil fuel to electricity, the government doesn’t seem to be keeping pace. While it is yet to build the infrastructure for electric vehicles, including charging stations, its policy on import and sales of such vehicles isn’t consistent. Another important area where the government should concentrate its efforts on is increasing the consumption of electricity in the kitchens of Nepalis across the country. The ministry of energy should devise some attractive schemes to replace cooking gas with electric stoves. Authorities don’t seem to be seriously working on these fronts. Instead, the government at times looks derailed. At a time when it needs to expedite work to replace fossil fuel-based activities with electricity, the government is preparing to build oil pipeline connecting Siliguri of India to Charali in Jhapa, a greenfield tank terminal in Charali, and an extension of the pipeline from Amlekhgunj to Lothar in Chitwan with India’s support.Promoting electricity and fossil fuel usage at the same time, the government seems to be trying to have it both ways. This approach is wrong approach. What the government should do is to formulate a clear policy of promoting clean energy-based activities and formulate a comprehensive plan on energy production and consumption. That should be guided by the approach of increasing domestic consumption and exporting surplus production. This strategy has multiple benefits. Replacement of the huge quantity of imported fossil fuels with electricity saves billions of rupees, helps rejuvenate the country’s economy and decarbonises the transport and other sectors. \nThe weather on Saturday is expected to be partly to generally cloudy across the country. Light to moderate rain, accompanied by thunder and lightning, is likely in several areas of all provinces, according to the Meteorological Forecasting Division.For tonight, the forecast predicts partly to generally cloudy skies throughout the country. Light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is likely in some areas of Koshi, Bagmati, Gandaki, and Sudurpaschim provinces, with a few showers possible in other provinces as well.On Friday, the highest temperature was recorded at 34.8°C in Dhangadhi, while Jomsom saw the lowest at 15.0°C. Simara experienced the heaviest rainfall in the past 24 hours, recording 130.0 mm. \nThe shopkeeper asked if I was a police officer or worked for the Nepal police when I went to purchase the book ‘Bepatta Sipahi’. His question surprised me, so I asked why he thought that. He mentioned that many police officers often ask for this book, so he assumed I might be one of them.This made me wonder what was in the book that prompted such a question. I knew it was the sequel to ‘Sipahi Ko Diary’, a book about war and soldiers. But later, I understood why the police were particularly interested in it.The decade-long civil war in Nepal is often said to have set the country back by 100 years. Beyond the physical devastation, it took thousands of innocent lives and shattered countless families. Similarly, the Kedarnath flood on June 16, 2013, also claimed thousands of lives. While these two events might seem unrelated, they are deeply interconnected in ‘Bepatta Sipahi’. These two incidents shape the narrative, plot, and characters.‘Bepatta Sipahi’ is a story of pain, death, and destruction brought by war, affecting both soldiers and their families. Just as life seems to stabilise, more suffering is introduced by the Kedarnath flood. The book revolves around Tej Bahadur Raut, a missing soldier who served in the Nepal Army during the civil war. Through his first-person perspective, the story vividly portrays the horrors of war—the deaths of comrades, the mass graves, and the blood-soaked battlegrounds shared by both soldiers and Maoist fighters. It highlights the tragic reality of Nepali citizens forced to fight against those they once considered brothers and sisters, all due to political turmoil.In ‘Sipahi Ko Diary’, the writer narrates the experiences and struggles of the soldier Shiva Chhetri. In ‘Bepatta Sipahi’, the focus shifts to his fellow soldier, Tej Bahadur Raut, who went missing during the war. During a visit to Kedarnath with his cousin-brother, Shiva comes across Tej's diary. The story unfolds through this diary, where Tej recounts various war incidents, his family troubles, the horrors of battle, and the circumstances leading to his disappearance. Shiva is portrayed as a brave soldier, often leading his team to victories against the Maoists and earning praise from his superiors and peers. However, after a significant incident, his life takes a dramatic turn, opening up a new chapter in the story.The connection between Tej's journey from the civil war to the Kedarnath flood is captivating, keeping readers on edge and eager to find out what happens next. The story is filled with twists, making it difficult to predict the plot. This book blends elements of thriller, suspense, romance, and more, capturing the rollercoaster of Tej's life as he navigates through unforeseen challenges and finds himself in situations he never imagined. The unpredictable turns in his life echo the book's line, \"Manchey le socheko pugdaina vanchan. Tara sochyo vane pugcha,\" meaning, \"People say just expecting, or thinking is not enough. But it is enough.\" The story reflects that while life is full of surprises, expecting the unexpected is no surprise.Katuwal's ‘Bepatta Sipahi’ spans different periods, from the civil war to the Kedarnath flood, with time shifting as the author narrates various events. The book also includes a fragment from the diary of Tej's sister, Niru, a Maoist soldier. Mentioned in Tej's diary, Niru’s account provides insight into the perspective of a Maoist soldier. It reveals why she joined the Maoists and became a soldier, even if it meant opposing her family and turning her brother into an enemy. The book portrays the shared terror of war through her story, where soldiers on both sides are tragically forced to fight against each other.The war scenes in ‘Bepatta Sipahi’ are depicted with striking detail, capturing every nuance of the experience. The emotions involved—firing at the enemy, having brief conversations with comrades, or witnessing their deaths—are conveyed, allowing readers to fully immerse themselves in the story.The writer incorporates multiple languages in the book, including Nepali, Hindi, and English, adding depth and authenticity to the narrative.The book provides a detailed portrayal of the civil war, vividly illustrating the conditions people and villages face. It captures the horror of war through the eyes of a soldier, highlighting the uncertainty of their lives and the government's shortcomings in protecting them. The character often voices frustration over the government's neglect of soldiers' safety.While ‘Bepatta Sipahi’ focuses on Tej's life, the array of characters and shifting settings—from the battlefield to Kedarnath—can initially be confusing. The story may seem disjointed initially, but the connections between the characters and events become clearer as readers progress. However, the book has some literary shortcomings, such as using specialised military terminology that might be challenging for some readers.Although ‘Bepatta Sipahi’ is a sequel to ‘Sipahi Ko Diary’, it stands alone and can be understood without reading the first book. While ‘Sipahi Ko Diary’ recounts the author's experiences as a soldier, ‘Bepatta Sipahi’ shifts focus to the story of a fellow soldier and his search for him, drawing on the author's real-life experiences.Bepatta SipahiAuthor: Chandra KatuwalYear: 2022Publisher: Bhundipuran PrakashanPages: 216 \nIn a bid to monitor the nutrition status of the population, the Ministry of Health and Population is planning to carry out a nutrition assessment survey in all districts throughout the country in the ongoing fiscal year.Officials said the nutrition status of pregnant women, children under five, adolescents, and new mothers will be monitored during the survey.“We will first assess the nutrition condition of the people of specific age groups and then share the findings with relevant agencies, including the Ministry of Health and Population,” said Lila Bikram Thapa, chief of the Nutrition Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “The nutrition assessment survey is crucial for getting the latest picture of the nutrition status of the population.”Malnutrition is a silent crisis in Nepal. The country has made significant progress in reducing stunting among children under five. According to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022 report, stunting decreased from 57 percent in 2001 to 25 percent in 2022.Wasting, a debilitating disease that causes muscle and fat tissues to waste away among children under five, decreased from 11 percent in 2001 to eight percent in 2022.Wasting or low weight for one’s height in children, if not treated properly and on time, is associated with a higher mortality risk, according to the World Health Organisation.Even though the health survey report showed some improvement in the country’s overall nutrition status, progress is not the same in all provinces. More than 16 percent of the children under five years in Lumbini Province are found to be suffering from wasting—the most immediate, visible, and life-threatening form of malnutrition.Likewise, around 10 percent of children under the age of five years in Madhesh Province have been found suffering from wasting.Officials said the new study was required to determine the latest progress on the population's nutrition conditions.“The nutrition status of the adolescent population will be monitored by schools, while health facilities will monitor children, pregnant women, and new mothers,” said Thapa. “Health workers will also take classes in schools to educate students about the importance of good nutrition and counsel pregnant women and new mothers at health facilities.”Along with the lack of sufficient nutrient foods, poor sanitation and lack of safe drinking water and treatment are blamed for wasting.Doctors say malnutrition during pregnancy increases the risk of complications and maternal and neonatal deaths, as well as the likelihood of low birth weight. It is a major impediment to growth, affecting human capital and economic productivity of a country.Experts say nutrition is directly linked to the country's overall development. Malnutrition affects children's physical and mental growth, which ultimately affects the country’s economic health.It weakens intellectual capacity, limits productivity in adulthood, and increases vulnerability to certain diseases.Nutritionists ask authorities to promote locally available foods, educate people about the importance of a nutritious diet, and provide fortified flour to improve nutritional conditions and reduce dependency on freely distributed foods.Nepal also has an international obligation to improve the condition of malnourished children.To meet the SDG targets, the country needs to reduce stunting to 15 percent from the current 32 percent by 2030, wasting to four percent from the current eight percent, underweight condition to 10 percent from the existing 19 percent, and anaemia to 10 percent from more than 43 percent at present.The SDGs, a follow-up on the Millennium Development Goals, (MDGs), aim to end poverty, hunger, and all forms of inequality worldwide by 2030, and Nepal has committed to meeting the goals. \nCricketer Gulsan Jha, football player Preeti Rai, volleyball player Kabita Bhatta, kabbadi’s Manmati Bista and Rugby’s Shree Ram Shrestha have been nominated for the peoples’ choice award for the annual Pulsar Sports Award, which is scheduled to be held on September 13.Organiser Nepal Sports Journalist Forum (NSJF) unveiled the five nominees for the peoples’ choice award amid a function in Kathmandu on Friday. The nominations for the peoples’ choice category is done based on their achievements and popularity in their respective sports discipline in the last few years. The winner of the people’s choice award will be decided through eSewa votes, Facebook likes and points given by NSJF members and chief coaches of national sports associations affiliated with Nepal Olympic Committee. The eSewa votes will have 50 percent weightage, Facebook likes carry 25 percent and the points given by coaches and NSJF members will carry 12.5 percent weightage each.“All the nominees of the peoples’ choice award are outstanding in their game. For us, they all are the winners,” said NSJF General Secretary Prajwal Oli, who is also coordinator of the players selection committee.NSJF renewed its deal with its voting partner eSewa on the occasion. NSJF President Subedi and eSewa Chief Business Officer Ashish Gautam exchanged the Memorandum of Understanding. It’s the fifth consecutive year NSJF joined hands with eSewa.Last week, NSJF extended the sponsorship deal with its main sponsor Golchha Group for a 16th edition in a row. Golchha Group is the holding company of Hansaraj Hulaschand and Company, which is an authorised distributor and producer of Bajaj Pulsar motorbikes in Nepal.NSJF is recognising athletes and sports professionals in ten categories—Male Player of the Year, Female Player of the Year, Coach of the Year, Youth Player of the Year, Team of the Year, People's Choice Award, Lifetime Achievement Award, Para Athlete Honour, Special Award, and the Asian Sports Journalist Award—this year.The winner of the peoples’ choice award will receive a Pulsar NS 400 two-wheeler, while Male Player of the Year, Female Player of the Year, Youth Player of the Year, Coach of the Year will be awarded with Pulsar NS 200.The winners of the Team of the Year Award, Lifetime Achievement Award, Special Award, and Para Athlete Honour will be awarded Rs100,000 each.The winners of other five categories will be revealed during the award ceremony.“The nominees for the player of the year male, female, youth, coach will be announced in a few days,” said NSJF Secretary Anjan Khadka.National cricket team member Jha had an important role in guiding Nepal to ACC Men’s Premier Cup trophy and their maiden Asia Cup in India. His unbeaten 67 (84) had guided Nepal to a seven-wicket victory against the United Arab Emirates in the Premier Cup final. Jha was also an important part of the Nepal squad at ICC U-19 World Cup and T20 World Cup. Footballer Rai has established herself as one of the most important players of the national women’s football team. Her stoppage time goal against Lebanon guided Nepal to the final of the WAFF Women’s Championship last year.Manmati Bista was a part of the Nepal national women’s kabaddi team who won a bronze medal at the 19th Asian Games in Hangzhou, China.Volleyball player Bhatta is a regular at the national team. She was in the squad that secured a silver medal at the CAVA Women’s Volleyball Nations League this month.Rugby’s Shrestha led Bagmati Province to the championship during the National Games. He also represented Nepal in the rugby competition at the 19th Asian Games. \nMadhesh United, one of the six franchise teams of the inaugural edition of the Everest Women’s Volleyball League, have signed Tunisian player Yosrah Zeramdini.It is the second foreign signing of Madhesh after also recruiting Yevginiya Kalinova of Kazakhstan earlier this week.“We are very excited to have signed Yoshrah Zeramdini. We believe that Zeramdini’s arrival will strengthen Madhesh’s blocking,” the club said in a statement on Friday.Middle blocker Zeramdini is a member of Tunisia’s national team. The 23-year-old, who is 184 cm tall, will also carry experience of the Russian league to Madhesh United.“I have heard about Nepal many times. I am very excited about my upcoming journey …..to play in a beautiful country with Madhesh United,” Zeramdini said.Madhesh’s other squad members include Niruta Thagunna, Puja Tharu, Sangam Mahat, Jasana Mahato, Shanti Tamang, Hira KC, Aashika Chhetri and Alisha Manandhar. Bharat Yadav will coach them in the league.All six teams have already announced their eight-member squad and respective coaches but Madhesh are the first team to announce foreign player.Gandaki, Kathmandu, Madhesh, Lalitpur, Karnali and Chitwan are competing in the tournament. \nAn avalanche in ward 2 of Thasang Rural Municipality, Mustang, has blocked the Boksikhola, a tributary of the Kaligandaki River.Deputy Superintendent of Police Bhoj Raj Pandey, chief of the District Police Office, Mustang, said the avalanche from the Dhaulagiri Icefall blocked the river near Gurusangwe Cave, just downstream from the river’s source. The avalanche has obstructed around 80 percent of the river’s flow.Somal Hirachan, vice-chair of the rural municipality, told the Post that while there is no immediate risk by the flood, residents of five to seven houses have been relocated to safer ground. He warned, however, of the potential for a flash flood downstream if the lake formed by the avalanche bursts. \nAnother Olympic Games has come and gone and Nepal’s quest to bring home an official Olympic medal continues to seem like a pipe dream.Nepal sent seven athletes to the 2024 Summer Games in Paris to compete in six different sports but none of them will have anything to show for back home—no athlete from Nepal has won a single official medal in the country’s 60-year Olympic history.But, is it at all realistic to expect an Olympic medal from Nepali athletes?“Winning a medal at the Olympics is not impossible. But our investment and preparation for the Olympics and other international events are woefully inadequate,” said former Olympican Deepak Bista, who currently serves as the president of Nepal Olympians Association and the director of national team preparation, at the National Sports Council. “There are no proper venues for players to train and practice, So how do you compete against elite athletes from around the world?” Athlete Santoshi Shrestha completed the difficult 41.195km track of the women’s marathon event in the 79th position out of 91 athletes. Her timing of 2 hours 55 minutes and 06 seconds was far from her previous best and national record of 2 hours 46 minutes and 23 seconds, which she set on the way to marathon debut gold at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Dhaka Marathon earlier this year.After the women’s marathon, Santoshi said she could have set a new national record in Paris had she pushed herself more in an endurance-testing track, but she chose not to because of fear of possible injury.“I could not take the risk because the track was very steep after 15 km. I was comfortable and could have made a new record there [in Paris] but I chose to stay in the comfort zone. I want to compete in other tournaments as well,” said Santoshi.But Santoshi’s story could have been different had her preparations and training back home been better. “Further, players, coaches and team management all need to work hard with complete focus and dedication all round the year if they are to bring medals. Sadly, the state of our players is not good enough. They are compelled to find other jobs so that they can look after their families. How can we expect them to win medals at big tournaments?” added Bista, who was the second Nepali athlete to qualify for the Olympics, Beijing 2008.“The players need physical, mental and financial support.”Former Nepali Olympian Sangina Baidya also points to poor investment and preparation in sports for Nepal’s underperformance at the Olympics.“There is a lack of extensive investment in sports infrastructures. The state should be interested in the development of sports. If there is sufficient investment at the youth level, and they get substantial funding, resources and infractures, they can undoubtedly perform better in the international competitions including the Olympics,” said taekwondo practitioner Baidya, who was the first Nepali athlete to qualify for the Olympics, in Athens 2004, through a selection tournament.“In comparison to other successful countries, here in Nepal, preparations for the Olympics start late. They get only a few months of training, which is not enough,” she added.Judoka Manita Shrestha Pradhan has a similar story. She got a training room only two months before the Olympics and she was still expected to win at least one or two bouts in Paris—which is a lot to ask for. Shrestha Pradhan could not progress beyond the first round of women’s 57 kg weight category event.There is no targeted budget for the Olympics programme despite the sports sector getting Rs3.5 billion for the fiscal year 2024/25. Only Rs9 million was allocated for the transport, lodging and food of athletes and officials participating in the Paris Olympics and Paralympics.The Nepal Olympic Committee provides $750 per person to the 10 athletes of the 10 sports under the International Olympic Committee’s Solidarity scholarship, which is insufficient. Swimmers Alexander Shah and Duana Lama trained abroad, in the United States and Thailand, respectively, but the scholarship amount was not enough for them to train at top-class facilities. Lama finished last in her Heat and 30th overall in women’s 200m freestyle.Shah, who was competing at the Olympics for a second consecutive time, will at least return home with some joy. His 51.91 seconds in the men’s 100m freestyle Heat shattered his own previous national record of 52.17 seconds set during the World Aquatic Championship in Doha, Qatar.Badminton star Prince Dahal trained in Sri Lanka and had to travel to Paris 2024 without a coach as Nepali authorities did not send the name of the coach for accreditation and visa process on time.Prince Dahal could not win a single match in the men’s singles group stage. Shooter Sushmita Nepal finished 42nd in the women’s 10m air rifle qualification event. Table tennis player Santoo Shrestha also exited the Olympics from the men’s singles preliminary round.But big investment in sports may not always do the trick.Santoo Shrestha, who competed in the men’s singles table tennis at Paris Olympics, was the only third player in Nepal’s Olympic history to qualify for the Olympics through the selection stage—which is a perfect demonstration of how poor the country is technically.Take Jamaica and Kenya. Athletes in these countries are highly successful in athletics.Jamaica—the home of sprinter Usian Bolt, eight time Olympic gold medallist and world record holder in the 100 metres, 200 metres, and 4 × 100 metres relay—has won a total of 87 medals at the Olympics. Of them 86 have come from track and field.Kenya is the most successful African country at the Olympics, with a total of 124 medals so far. Of them 117 are from track and field and seven from boxing.Ethiopia is another nation which focuses on long-distance events. Their total of 58 Olympic medals have all come in long-distance events in athletics.India was once a dominant country in field hockey and won a record 11 Olympic medals, including eight golds between 1928 and 1980. Although the country experienced a drought in hockey medals, the sport is gradually finding new success after its team picked two consecutive hockey bronze medals in Tokyo 2020 and Paris 2024. Wrestling and shooting are the other sports Indian athletes specialise in.“The government should learn from how other countries prepare their athletes,” said Bista, suggesting that Nepal should target some sports for the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles and prepare accordingly.Nepal has won a total of 26 medals at the Asian Games. Of them, it has bagged 24 medals in martial arts, which include karate (4), taekwondo (14) and boxing (6). “Nepal should select sports in which Nepal is historically good, for instance martial arts. After that, the government should allocate a significant budget just for the Olympics programme and train the players from the beginning if it expects our athletes to do better,” Bista added.Technically, Nepal’s only medal at the Olympics came in 1988 in Seoul when Bidhan Lama won a bronze medal in the men’s 50kg weight category taekwondo competition. But his medal was counted as unofficial as the sport was then an exhibition event. Taekwondo entered the Olympics programme only at Sydney 2000.But the 2026 Asian Games in Aichi-Nagoya, Japan could be a head start.The National Sports Council has launched Mission 2026 as part of the preparations for the next Asiad and has targeted at least 10 medals. But, sadly, the government has only approved Rs20 million for the programme.“We don’t have enough funding for the programme. This amount will support our athletes for only five to six months. It is unfortunate that the government could not embrace the NSC’s mission.” Bista said, adding that he fears Mission 2026 will just be an ambitious dream.But Bista hopes Palesha Goverdhan may change history despite the odds. Goverdhan became the first Nepali paralympian to pass the selection stage when she qualified for the Paris Paralympics. She won a gold medal in the Asian Qualifiers in China.Govardhan also won a bronze at the 2022 Asian Para Games, becoming the first Nepali para athlete to win a medal at the event.“Palesha is training in London under one of the best trainers,” said Bista who added that the NSC is paying her training fees. \nThe Rastriya Swatantra Party, claiming to be \"cadre-less,\" emerged as Nepal's fourth-largest party in 2022, but is now considering forming grassroots party committees despite its initial anti-cadre stance.\nBangladesh's political crisis mirrors Nepal's history of autocratic rule, highlighting India's role in emboldening undemocratic tendencies, raising concerns about its foreign policy in South Asia.\nChinese drones will be used in Nepal to clear garbage from Mt.

This shift is vividly captured in Muna Bhadel's artistic practice, whose paintings reflect her grandmother’s life and the broader implications for women in Nepal.Early marriages and familial responsibilities profoundly influenced many older female generations, including Bhadel’s grandmother. Bhadel’s artistic practice delves into her grandmother's life experiences and dreams, offering personal insight into the generational differences between older women and their younger counterparts.With her exhibition, ‘Silent Whispers’, which opened at Siddhartha Art Gallery on August 19, she hopes that young Nepali women who view her work can relate to and connect to her experiences.Bhadel shared that her grandmother was eight years old when she married her husband, who was 13. This left her grandmother with many unfulfilled dreams and repressed desires, which her granddaughter has had the chance to pursue. Her artwork, supported by an Australian Himalayan Foundation Art Award, seeks to bring this generational divide to light in a way that resonates with contemporary Nepali women.Bhadel’s recent work consists of large acrylic paintings featuring elderly Nepali women, often based on her grandmother. These paintings are distinctive due to her use of two different painting styles, which signify the separation between her grandmother and her dreams. While her grandmother is depicted in a hyper-realistic style, the rest of the scenes are in a pictorial style inspired by old Nepali and Indian Mughal/Rajput miniature paintings.In addition, the artist intentionally chooses the colours and patterns worn by the women in her paintings, adding another dimension to the meanings behind her paintings. Traditionally, clothing changes depending on a woman’s marital status, meaning that clothing can signify what stage of life a woman is in. For example, as the artist explained, when a woman is married, she usually wears red, but when she is widowed, she must wear white. In most of her paintings, her colour palette is predominantly red. One of her paintings particularly stood out to me. It features her grandmother looking downwards, longingly, out of a traditional Nepali window frame. To her right are three vertical scenes of lovers, reminiscent of a Patachitra narrative scroll.The first scene features Krishna attending to Radha’s hair, the second is a man bowing to his lover, and the third is two lovers sharing a meaningful conversation. Bhadel described these scenes as the love and intimacy that her grandmother wished she had felt from her husband and the life she wished she had had the opportunity to pursue.The painting evokes a strong sense of grief, grief over a life that never happened and experiences that were taken away before Bhadel’s grandmother was old enough to make her own decisions.In an interview, Bhadel reflected on how, just two generations later, she has experienced many freedoms that her grandmother had not—falling in love and pursuing her artistic career.The artist’s work not only honours her grandmother's journey but also serves as a broader commentary on the societal constraints that have historically limited women’s opportunities in Nepal.Early marriages restrict young girls from pursuing their education and realising their full potential. Child marriage was officially made illegal in Nepal in 1963, and the nation has one of the highest legal ages for marriage at 20 years old (or 18 with parental consent). Unfortunately, statistics reveal a mixed picture: while there has been progress in reducing child marriage rates, substantial barriers remain, particularly in rural areas where the law is harder to implement.Various women’s rights activist groups have pushed for stricter laws on child marriage and more focus on women’s education, resulting in the Nepal Government endorsing a National Strategy to End Child Marriage in Nepal by 2030 in 2016.This governmental promise is incredibly important, as a lack of autonomy over one’s body restricts freedoms in nearly every aspect of life. According to a UN study conducted in Nepal in 2016, only 47.7 percent of women aged 15-49 said that they make their own decisions regarding sexual relations, contraceptive use, and reproductive healthcare.In partial correlation with the dropping child marriage rates, girls’ access to education has greatly increased, which is another major contributor to the generational divide that Bhadel has experienced.A study conducted in 2018 by UNESCO showed that the literacy rate of women aged 15-24 was 90.88 percent, while the literacy rate of all women ages 15+ was only 59.72 percent. This reveals a huge difference in the number of women in the new generation who have had access to schooling and have the opportunity to pursue their dreams beyond building a family. Her paintings vividly depict the unrealised dreams of women who have navigated the complexities of familial responsibilities. The contrast between realistic portrayals and imaginative Mughal-style scenes underscores the tension between personal aspirations and societal expectations. These artworks testify to the resilience and untold stories of women whose voices are often marginalised.Through her art, Bhadel emphasises the importance of understanding and learning from the older female generation’s experiences rather than simply highlighting feminist struggles. Her art memorialises personal histories rather than advocating for an avenue for societal change.With her paintings, she hopes to foster a deeper understanding among her audience, particularly younger women grappling with similar societal pressures. Bhadel’s relationship with her grandmother reflects a broader societal phenomenon, so she hopes that when Nepali women see her artworks, they can reflect on their own experiences with their female relatives’ generation gap.‘Silent Whispers’Where: Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal Revisited, KathmanduTimings: 11:00 am to 5:00 pm, On Saturday: 12:00 pm to 5:00 pmTill September 18Irwin is a Cypriot undergraduate student studying anthropology alongside visual arts at Princeton University. \nKul Chandra Gautam's international diplomacy career and literary pursuits were shaped by his passion for reading and his three self-authored books reflect his views on Nepal's political economy, personal journey, and global perspectives.\nRajen Kandel, founder and chief executive officer of The British Education Group (BEG), which includes The British College (TBC), has been awarded ‘MD of the Year’ in the SME News IT Awards 2024.

Also, 49 people went missing, and the disasters displaced at least 5,883 families, police said.Among the missing, 41 are from Bagmati Province, followed by two each from Koshi and Gandaki provinces, and one each from Madhesh, Lumbini, Karnali, and Sudurpaschim provinces. \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli has said that efforts are being made to incite people in the name of disenchantment towards the political parties.Responding to questions from lawmakers during a House of Representatives meeting on Thursday, Prime Minister Oli said that those who do not like healthy competition between the political parties or those who are dissatisfied with the current political system are trying to stir up people against the political parties and create political unrest.There have been efforts to make people more dissatisfied with the political system than they actually are, Prime Minister Oli said.Addressing Parliament before Oli, Nepali Congress lawmaker Narayan Khadka had warned the government to be cautious about the use of social media.“The current government is trying to instill hope in the people by taking everything into consideration,” Prime Minister Oli said in reply. “Positive results have started to appear in the short period of time since the formation of the government in my leadership and the current government has no excuse not to work. The government will work seriously to instill hope in the people.”At least three lawmakers raised questions about constitutional amendment to the Prime Minister. While answering their questions, Prime Minister Oli said that constitutional amendment is not a matter of courage. “We will amend the constitution taking into account the experience of eight years of its implementation,” Oli said.Meanwhile, lawmaker Narayani Sharma asked whether the current government formed with the objective of amending the constitution dares to revise the constitutional provision related to the electoral system and introduce the provision of a directly elected executive head.“Amendment of the constitution is not a matter of courage,” Oli said. “The government won’t dare to amend the constitutional provision that does not need revision, but where it is needed, the government will not hesitate to show the courage.”Likewise, Pashupati Shamsher Rana of Rastriya Prajantra Party also asked which of the articles of the constitution was the present coalition government of Nepali Congress and CPN-UML vying to amend.“There is no definite article that the present government is aiming to amend as of now,” Oli answered. “It would be determined during the amendment process and it will be done based on the discussion with the lawmakers.”Congress lawmaker Khadka had also put forth his queries related to constitution amendment.The coalition government led by Oli was formed after the seven-point agreement between Nepali Congress and CPN-UML on July 1. With the agreement between two of the largest parties in the country, the Pushpa Kamal Dahal government, formed in support of UML on March 4, was unseated from the position on July 12.One of the objectives the two parties came together to form the government is to amend the constitution, leaders have said.During the quizz with the prime minister, CPN (Maoist Centre) lawmaker Purna Bahadur Gharti Magar raised the issue related to the State Partnership Program (SPP) and the recent visit of US Deputy Secretary of State Management and Resources Richard R Verma to Nepal.Verma was on a two-day visit to Nepal, starting on August 16. Beside vowing to continue US support to Nepal in various sectors, Verma also informed the prime minister that the US intends to support $100 million in foreign military finance to support Nepal’s rotary wing capabilities.“During the meeting with Verma, we discussed the multifaceted relations between two countries,” Oli said. “Verma said that the US will provide two helicopters to the Nepal Army. No issue related to SPP was discussed.”Oli also claimed that most of the tasks relating to power trade with Bangladesh have already been concluded and there was a plan last month to sign the pact in the presence of the energy ministers of Nepal, India and Bangladesh.The scheduled event was cancelled due to political unrest in Bangladesh.The then Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled the country on August 5 and Nobel laureate Mohammad Yunus became the interim prime minister of the country on August 8.While answering the question of Congress lawmaker NP Saud, Prime Minister Oli noted that the agreement, which has been six years in the making since the energy cooperation between Nepal and Bangladesh was established, remained a top priority for the Nepali government.“Given the recent developments in Bangladesh and the formation of an interim government there, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Energy, Water Resources, and Irrigation of Nepal are working to finalise the agreement as soon as possible,” Oli said.Prime Minister Oli underscored the importance of the agreement, saying that it will mark a significant milestone in sub-regional energy cooperation in South Asia, as it will be the first time Nepal exports electricity to Bangladesh.Moreover, Prime Minister Oli presented details as to how the government is working on a long-term plan to export 10,000 megawatts of electricity to India over the next decade. \nThe Nepali Congress statute says that six months after the party's general convention, it should elect the heads of various party departments along with its members. The Congress held its 14th general convention in Kathmandu in December 2021. Almost two and a half years after the party's general convention, Sher Bahadur Deuba, the party president, appointed the heads of 37 departments on August 5. Deuba also appointed 17 department heads last year. The party has yet to name 16 heads, including those of organisational, foreign affairs, and public relations departments. The Congress must hold its next general convention by the end of 2025, as per the party statute. However, it can be deferred by a few months citing special reasons. If the party is to hold its general convention on time, that should be done within over a year from now. But the party has also not appointed some office-bearers, let alone the departmental heads and its members, Congress leaders say.The treasurer remains to be appointed. The largest party in the House of Representatives has 70 departments. During last year's central committee meeting, the party increased its department count from 48 to 70. Though the party president appointed the various department heads, the leadership still needs to finalise the members of those departments. The party statute provides for each department to appoint 51 members. According to the party leader, the department head has the right to appoint ten members, whereas the party president appoints the rest, as per the statute. Govinda Pokharel, the head of the Economic Policy and Planning department, says the upcoming central committee meeting will appoint members of various departments. The party's prorogued central committee meeting will resume on Friday. The party central committee meeting commenced on August 7. After the five-day meeting, it was postponed for ten days, arguing that the party leaders needed to give time in Parliament and the parliamentary committee.“The party department could have shown the result by now had it been formed in time,” Pokharel told the Post. “But, if we look at the history of Congress, no president in the recent past has formalised the party department in time. Deuba is no exception.”Before Deuba, Sushil Koirala and Girija Prasad Koirala were the party presidents, and Pokharel added that both leaders failed to make the party department vibrant during their time.Arjun Narasingha KC, who has worked in various positions in the party, effectively under Girija Prasad's Koirala, partially agrees with Pokharel. “Forming the party department and making them vibrant was not a problem during Girija Prasad Koiral’s tenure. However, during Sushil Koirala and Deuba’s tenures, it became a major problem,” KC told the Post.“Forming the party department should not have been a problem for the president, but why are they hesitant? I just can’t say,” KC said.The party's statute mentions that the party president is responsible for appointing the department head and its members. However, the party leaders say that when other leaders, especially a senior one, show interest, the appointment gets delayed. “Various party departments are the organisational tools for the leaders to exercise power within the party,” Pokharel added. “If the leaders can install their favourite as the department head, it can amplify their strength within the party. Many of the party's senior leaders are interested in selecting the department heads and their members.”Last year, during the party's central committee meeting, which increased the number of departments, General Secretary Gagan Thapa had formalised a calendar of party activities. It mentioned appointing the department heads within two months. However, the party failed to follow the calendar passed by the central committee meeting. Thapa’s proposal was a good initiative but it failed in implementation, KC told the Post. As time passed, Deuba appointed some department heads. But can the departments formed late work effectively? For Pokharel, it depends on the leadership of the department. “But, chances to perform well will be slim.” “The lack of discipline in Congress, as seen lately, and the weakness in building party organisation are some of the reasons for not having effective party departments,” Pokharel argued. “Had our departments been functional, our local leaders and cadres would have known the party's thought process through various departmental programmes.” He adds that the party needs working departments.But political analyst Geja Sharma Wagle has a different take. Congress follows the traditional system of party operation. As long as the party is run in a traditional way, Wagle says, whether it forms the departments or not won’t matter.“The only way to make the Congress functional is to change its system,” Wagle told the Post. “The Congress should have a directly elected party president, in a departure from the traditional system, to make the party functional.” \nWhen the political parties in the House of Representatives appear divided over the idea of amending the constitution, vaguely floated by the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, the Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal (JSP-Nepal), has said it would welcome it provided the party’s demands are addressed.KP Sharma Oli became prime minister based on a July 1 agreement reached between the Congress and the UML. In the same deal, the two largest parties also agreed to take turns to head the government and amend the constitution, purportedly to ensure political stability, among other things. “The national consensus government will prioritise reviewing the strengths, weaknesses, and complications observed in implementing the constitution and will focus on amending the constitution and enacting related laws to ensure political stability,” Prime Minister Oli stated in Parliament on July 21, during his floor test. Some parties, including the CPN (Maoist Centre), the third largest party in the House of Representatives, have raised serious concerns about the intentions behind the proposed amendments, accusing the big parties of attempting to revoke some progressive features of the statute. Maoist Centre chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal was ousted from the position of prime minister on July 12 after the two largest parties joined hands to form a government. The Rastriya Swatantra Party, the fourth largest in the lower house, has also questioned the motives behind the Congress-UML deal. The JSP-Nepal, however, is comparatively more open to the idea of revising the constitution. The party has demanded that its certain concerns must be addressed should there be any amendments to the statute. The party has called for the formation of a constitutional review commission comprised of experts to propose amendments. The party’s central committee meeting held from August 11 to 14 decided to support amendments based on the recommendations of an elite commission. The party has also demanded amending the constitution to place local units under the provincial government. Likewise, it has demanded a directly elected executive head, a fully proportional election system, a federal justice system with proportional and inclusive representation, and self-governance based on national and ethnic identity. Yadav, who led a different political party, had submitted these proposals in the Constituent Assembly while drafting the statute as well.“The names of provinces should reflect their identities,” mentions the decision of the party’s central committee meeting.Many of JSP-Nepal’s demands related to amendments echo Yadav’s previous positions. Although the party had compromised on its demands during the constitution-making process for consensus, it is now advocating for a directly elected executive head, among other things. “Most of our current demands are the same ones that we had registered during the constitution-drafting process,” Prakash Adhikari, a party leader and a federal lawmaker from the party, told the Post. “If the two major parties address our demands, we are open to revising the constitution.”But Chandrakishore, a political analyst from Madhesh, finds the JSP-Nepal’s demands as irrelevant. Except for the directly elected executive head, the issues the party now has raised are old ones, he told the Post.“The party’s latest demands are the issues of the Madhesh Movement, but Yadav then chose to align with the ruling parties and betrayed the movement,” Chandrakishore told the Post. “Now he is again raising the same old issues in an attempt to placate the Madheshi people.” “If JSP-Nepal wants to truly engage with the people, it needs a leadership overhaul. Repeating past demands won’t work.” Despite lending support to Prime Minister Oli during the trust vote, the party was not accommodated in the Cabinet, while its splinter faction, the Janata Samajbadi Party holds a key portfolio in the Oli government. After Ashok Rai, then federal chair of the party, along with six lawmakers, split the party on May 5 to form the Janata Samajbadi Party, the JSP-Nepal’s strength in the House has diminished markedly.The party concluded its general convention in June unanimously electing Yadav as party chair. Even after over two months of the convention, the party is still to elect its office bearers, though it has formed a central executive council. A party’s central committee meeting last week demanded that the parliamentary and provincial constituencies be redrawn based on the latest census. Likewise, the party has also called for proportional representation in the National Assembly. Similarly, the party also vows to dissolve District Coordination Committees, arguing they are redundant under the federal structure.  \nBarely a month after exiting from the government, the CPN (Maoist Centre), the third-largest party in the House of Representatives, has faced a power struggle between party chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Deputy General Secretary Janardan Sharma.The conflict between a wartime Maoist commander Sharma and his “supreme leader” Dahal, which had been simmering for quite a while, surfaced at the party’s standing committee meeting that concluded on Thursday.Sharma not only spoke against Dahal but also presented a written document to the standing committee. At the meeting, Sharma asked Dahal to step down as party chairman. Dahal has led the party uninterruptedly for over three-and-a-half decades.At the end of the standing committee meeting, leaders had said that the differences between Dahal and Sharma were resolved. But that conclusion seems premature. The two were busy accusing and criticising each other at a public function in Kathmandu. Dahal had to pacify Sharma on Saturday as he complained of not being trusted by Dahal and other Maoist leaders. “When I was assigned to build an alliance with the CPN-UML, I worked for the same but was tagged as KP Oli’s man,” Sharma said at the function. Later, the Maoist Centre decided to ally with the Nepali Congress, and he worked for the same as directed by Dahal, Sharma claimed. “But I was dubbed Sher Bahadur Deuba’s man. When will I be called the Maoist party’s man? When will you call me Prachanda’s man?” said Sharma, pointing to Dahal, who was sitting at the same podium as the chief guest.Taken aback, Dahal seemed to be consoling Sharma saying that comrade Prabhakar [Sharma] would never split the party, contrary to some media reports.Dahal rubbished reports that Sharma was trying to split the party as baseless and that the days-long standing committee meeting had dispelled all rumours.The Maoist party chief and former prime minister, however, admitted that there were still some confusions and that the meeting had decided to look into the matter and make things clear and resolve them with joint effort.Soon after the party was out of the government, it called the meetings of the standing committee and the secretariat and discussed the Maoist CEntre's future course, including unity with other fringe parties, strengthening the Socialist Front, and building the party’s organisation.“There were some matters of serious suspicion and some still exist. And the meeting has decided to study and find how such a situation of suspicion emerged,” Dahal said. The Maoist leader promised to study the issue jointly with Sharma and, if needed, the party may form a probe committee.“We have reached an understanding to properly address the remaining concerns as well,” Dahal added.Sharma is not alone in demanding that Dahal handover the party’s reins.Even Maoist Centre senior vice-chair Narayan Kaji Shrestha has asked Dahal to quit the leadership position. A large number of Maoist leaders at the central as well as lower committees want to see an overhaul of the party, said a central member.“If we fail to transform the party, there will be no hope for us besides surrendering to other parties in the 2027 elections,” the leader said.Another central committee member however doesn’t trust Dahal to build the party organisation. “Dahal would rather forge unity with other left parties and, if possible, explore options to contest the upcoming elections jointly with CPN-UML, the country’s largest communist party,” said the central member.The leader said he was unsure if the ruling UML would turn down Dahal’s proposal to join hands once again. According to him, Dahal’s strategy is to bring together left-leaning parties and put pressure on the UML, which leads the government with the backing of the Nepali Congress, to make an electoral alliance with the Maoists. The leader argues that the UML is preparing itself internally to contest the elections on its own, without allying with anyone.“This is the beginning of an infighting in the Maoist Centre because we abandoned the agenda of strengthening the federal, republican and secular Nepal,” said Ram Karki, secretary of the Maoist Centre. “This tussle is unlikely to stop anytime soon.”Because the conflict emerged under Dahal’s ‘schooling’, Karki claimed.He recalled that Mohan Baidya, who supported Dahal’s school of thought, engaged in a similar tussle before leaving the party. That conflict did not subside but intensified, leading Baidya to finally split the party, Karki observed.Later, Baburam Bhattarai, who also emerged allegedly from Dahal’s schooling, led a similar revolt, Karki recalled. “He also deserted the party. This time, too, the tussle has surfaced among those schooled under Dahal, so no one knows the outcome,” said Karki.For decades, Sharma remained a close confidant of Dahal. But he grew up to be a dissident after Dahal refused to appoint him the general secretary last year. Another deputy general secretary, Barsha Man Pun, was also an aspirant for the post of general secretary.Sharma and Pun are taken as Dahal’s lieutenants, right from the launch of the Maoist insurgency in 1996. Sidelining both during the 2022 party general convention, Dahal picked Dev Gurung, who had little influence in the party.Karki described the Congress-UML alliance’s move to oust the Maoist Centre from the government as a good opportunity to strengthen the Maoist party.“If the Nepali Congress and the UML hadn’t ejected our party from the government, we would have been finished by the time of next elections,” said Karki. “As we have been removed from power three years ahead of the election, there is some room for transformation.”Senior party leaders have given Dahal two options: transform himself and the party or vacate the chair that he has been occupying for over 35 years.Another central committee member said that if the conflict was an internal matter and the fight genuine, the party would emerge unscathed. “Otherwise, if external factors are working within the party, then the party will face a serious crisis,” said the leader.However, some Maoist leaders are confident that the party will not face a grave crisis. “Janardan ji questioned the party leadership. Isn’t that a good practice in the party?” said Yubaraj Chaulagain, a central committee member. “However, Chairman Dahal is addressing them.”Chaulagain said that the party leadership would collect reports from the party’s provincial committees and sister organisations and take the right decision based on them. “There’s the proposal for the party’s transformation. It will be discussed. We will gather more feedback and ideas from the lower committees, and follow them,” said Chaulagain. “Gradually, we will address the issues raised by Janardan ji.” \nCPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who has been leading the party for over three-and-a-half decades, has yet again pacified the leaders who want him to hand over the leadership.Janardan Sharma and Barsha Man Pun—deputy general secretaries of the Maoist party—had demanded that Dahal hand over the party leadership to a leader of their generation. The two leaders raised the issue during the standing committee meeting that commenced on August 9.Leaders concluded the meeting on Thursday as they decided to strengthen the Maoist party through internal dialogue between the leaders on their disagreements.Party secretary Ram Karki said that responding to the questions raised during the standing committee meeting on August 10, party chair Dahal vowed to address their issues.The party will resolve the theoretical as well as ideological differences among the party leaders through dialogue, Karki told the Post, quoting Dahal.On August 9, the first day of the meeting, the Maoist chair presented a verbal proposal on current political affairs, party building, and other pertinent issues.After Dahal’s presentation, some leaders raised questions about the party’s policies and leadership. Among them, Janardan Sharma, a deputy general secretary, submitted a written proposal on August 10, calling for a review of Dahal’s leadership and suggesting that the party chair be limited to a ceremonial role as patron.In his document, Sharma alleged, among other things, that the party leadership was trying to use state power against him.In the 14-page document submitted to the meeting, Sharma accused the party leadership of ‘spreading disinformation’ about him and the other deputy general secretary, Pun. He also accused the top leaders of even misusing state power against him.“The fake information about the party split, which was generated from Khumaltar [the private residence of Dahal], spread widely after reaching Baluwatar [the prime minister’s official residence where Dahal was staying until last month when the government changed],” Sharma questions the party leadership in his document. “There are questions: why did the leadership disseminate fake information?”However, Maoist Centre leaders said the issue has been settled, for now, after Dahal pledged to resolve it through intra-party discussions.Party chair Dahal, while speaking to the press briefly after the conclusion of the standing committee meeting on Thursday, said the reports and rumours about party split were baseless.“Rumours related to the party split led by comrade Prabhakar [Janardan Sharma] are baseless,” Dahal told journalists.The meeting also decided to hold consultative meetings at the provincial level, where the party's office bearers will also participate. After the meeting, the party will call for a full-fledged meeting of the central committee in mid-September (Ashoj first week).Another party secretary, Devendra Paudel, said the upcoming central committee meeting will call the party's special general convention, as decided during the eigth general convention held in 2022.But Lilamani Pokharel, a party secretary, says no decision was taken with regard to convening a special general convention as only the central committee has a mandate to call a special general convention, the supreme body of a party that can take final decisions on the party’s policies and leadership.“The party will go for a special general convention only if a central committee meeting decides to go for that,” Pokharel told the Post.After the party was out of the government in mid-July, calls for Dahal to relinquish the top position have grown. Haribol Gajurel, a close aide of Dahal and deputy general secretary, also raised the issue of leadership change during a meeting of party officials before the standing committee meeting and demanded a special congress to address the issues.Gajurel proposed that all office-bearers should resign and make a fresh start to rejuvenate the party. He even submitted his own resignation as a starting point. Following this, on the second day of the standing committee meeting held on August 10, Deputy General Secretary Sharma questioned the central leadership in his political paper.However, party spokesperson Agni Sapkota, who is close to Dahal, argued that the questions raised by Sharma were aimed at strengthening the party. “The issue I raised during the standing committee meeting was for the betterment of the party and to strengthen the leadership of Dahal,” Sapkota quoted Sharma as saying.“The party leadership has also taken the issue raised by the standing committee members, including deputy general secretary Gajurel, Sharma, and Barshaman Pun, on a positive note.”During Dahal's tenure as prime minister, Gajurel, his political adviser, had previously expressed dissatisfaction with the party's lack of adherence to procedures and methods. As questions arose about the central leadership of the Maoist Centre, which is focused on organisational development, Dahal found himself in a defensive position during the standing committee meeting. According to party insiders, it was after a long time that Dahal faced tremendous pressure during a standing committee meeting as both Sharma and Pun, who have strong command in the party organisation, stood together to demand Dahal’s exit from the party leadership. It was something unusual for Maoist leaders as the two leaders, who defended Dahal in the past, joined hands by closing their ranks to fiercely criticise the party chief. Sharma and Pun, both former finance ministers, are deemed the two most powerful leaders after Dahal.Both leaders claimed the position of general secretary at the party’s general convention in early 2022. Though they were willing to contest for the post, Dahal instead chose Dev Gurung as the general secretary. After the general convention, Sharma has been maintaining a distance from Dahal and he challenges the party chief on various occasions. Of late, Pun, too, has joined Sharma to challenge Dahal. At the standing committee meeting, Pun said there should be a debate on the party's chairperson's term limit. \"Instead of discussing whether the leader should step down now, we need to determine the chair’s term limit,\" he added. Leaders said Dahal faced a pressure of this scale in a party meeting probably for the first time in nearly a decade, since the exit of key leaders Baburam Bhattarai and Mohan Baidya. Bhattarai and Baidya lead their own parties now. \nPanic gripped locals in ward 12 of Chandragiri Municipality, Kathmandu, on Thursday morning after a suspicious object was found in the locality.The suspicious object was spotted in front of Balambu Secondary School, sparking fears of a bomb threat.Locals informed the police, and a bomb disposal team from the Nepal Army arrived at the scene. According to the NA Directorate of Public Relations and Information, the team disposed of the suspicious object, which turned out to be a pressure cooker.   \nKathmandu Metropolitan City has extended the area to prohibit building any structure on either side of the rivers in its territory.In a notice on Wednesday, the city office stated that construction of any structure has been barred on the additional 20 meters from the existing prohibited area.According to the metropolis notice, if the city has, under the existing rule, prohibited any construction on 20 meters from the area marked as river, the prohibited area will now be altogether 40 meters on either side of the waterway.The metropolis said the decision was taken based on a recent Supreme Court verdict that directed the authorities concerned to prohibit construction within an additional 20 metres from riverbanks in the Kathmandu Valley.Currently, construction is permitted only 20 metres beyond major riverbanks in the Kathmandu metropolis.The notice issued by the metropolis states, “No construction will be permitted on an additional 20 metres of land on either side of the river, and ongoing construction will be halted.”It has also asked one and all not to release contaminated water, including sewage, into Bagmati River and its tributaries. “Private and government buildings, as well as commercial properties, must install soak pits for groundwater recharge,” it said. “Waste must not be disposed of in the rivers. Non-compliance will lead to legal action under existing laws.” \nThe rhythmic beat of the Dha echoes through a Bhaktapur alley, blending with the energetic footsteps of dancers. Bhaktapur, which sees jatras and festivals round the year, is no stranger to music, dance and celebrations. But this is not an ordinary occasion. The performers in question are Lakhe dancers who are reviving the Ranjitkar Lakhe dance after a century.The young dancers are preparing for Indra Jatra this year, where mask-clad Lakhe dancers roam the streets to rid the community of hardships and suffering. Lakhe, demon deities revered as protectors of people and crops, are thought to reside in the demonic mask. As the dancer dons the mask, the spirit is said to take over.Bhaktapur was once a key site for the Ranjitkar Lakhe performances, but the art form vanished from the city after the 1934 earthquake.“Bhaktapur suffered the most damage during the 1934 earthquake,\" says Ganesh Ram Ranjit, treasurer of the Ranjitkar Group’s Bhaktapur branch. “The destruction left residents struggling to recover for a decade, making it nearly impossible to perform the costly Lakhe dance.”The Ranjitkar Group discovered the extinct dance in the year the group was established. They located a Lakhe temple in Bhaktapur that had closed after the earthquake. After two years of research, they learned that performing the Lakhe dance was seen as a good omen in Bhaktapur and involved hosting community feasts. However, the high cost of this tradition forced many to sell their properties, rendering it unfeasible in the city’s post-earthquake conditions. Over time, the dance was abandoned as more lands supporting these cultural events were lost during rapid urbanisation.“There was a significant decline in our engagement with our cultural heritage,” says Rabi Shakya, a sculptor and Lakhe dance teacher training the new dancers. “The encouraging change now is the strong interest from the new generation, which is making it possible to revive intangible heritage like this dance.”After 100 years, the Ranjitkar Lakhe Dance is making a return to Bhaktapur at this year’s Indra Jatra.“It’s challenging to accurately re-enact the dance since it hasn’t been seen in a century,” Shakya notes. “As a sculptor, I drew inspiration from Bhaktapur’s revered Shree Navadurga Bhawani to create the Lakhe’s mask.” Similarly, the dance was choreographed by studying Lakhe dances from Kathmandu, Patan, and Banepa within the Ranjitkar community, and combining them with traditional steps from Bhaktapur Lakhe dances.“As for the musical instruments, we are using traditional instruments like Dha, Dhime, and Ponga, which are said to excite the Lakhe,” says Rajendra Maharjan, Lakhe dance teacher and musician.Maharjan is one of the experienced Newari arts teachers working to revive the lost Lakhe dance. He is involved in training young students in cultural arts and is now dedicated to the Ranjitkar dance training, with the students practising together nearly every day.“Becoming a Lakhe performer involves more than just wearing the costume and mask,” said Sudin Ranjit, a Lakhe dance student. “We must train extensively with our teachers, and it demands a lot of hard work.”To Ranjit, a resident of Bhaktapur, the training is more than learning a new craft; it is a matter of protecting culture. Growing up only interested in instruments, he slowly understood how important continuing cultural practices like Lakhe dances is for their community.“The dance will not only bolster Bhaktapur’s cultural pride but also boost tourism and create jobs,” says Dr Purushottam Lochan Shrestha, a professor and researcher specialising in Bhaktapur and Newari culture.Shrestha notes that reviving the dance would offer employment to everyone involved, from the dancers and the sculptor making the masks to those participating in the rituals. “Economic centres throughout the city, from small businesses to large industries, will benefit from the influx of tourists attracted by the Lakhe dance,” Shrestha adds, commending the Ranjitkar group's initiative.Once the Ranjitkar community revitalises the Lakhe dance, the Ranjitkar group plans to set up a new Guthi house with a fresh community fund and organise annual events for the dance.“The Lakhe dance won’t let them separate,” Shakya remarks.In today’s globalised world, where identity often merges into a homogenised blend, shared cultural practices provide a sense of connection and belonging. This new Lakhe dance embodies that spirit of togetherness for the community involved.“Reviving the dance after 100 years,” Shakya says, “is about preserving our culture for the next 300 years.” \nThe Lions Club of Kathmandu Corporate, Nepal MD325-D has felicitated various personalities as part of its endeavour to recognise the contribution of the individuals and business entities for the society.As part of its campaign, the Lions Club of Kathmandu honoured Prateek Pradhan with Social Journalism Award, Sylapa T Rimponche with Social Spiritual Award, Erika Gurung with Social Player Award, Ramesh Corporation with Social Corporate House Award, Rajendra Malla with Social Corporate Leader Award and Rajesh Hamal with Social Celebrity Award.Likewise, Chandra Ghimire is honoured with Social Bureaucratic Award, Binod Das with Sports Management Award, Anil Kedia with Social Academic Award, Mohan Ojha with Social Management Award and Surya Nepal with Corporate Social Responsibility Award.The Lionism embarked in Nepal in 1971 as the Lions Club of Biratnagar under the stewardship of former Prime Minister Matrika Prasad Koirala.The Lions Clubs International says it has over 2,000 clubs operating across the nation. \nThe government has declared a public holiday in the Kathmandu Valley on Sunday to celebrate the Bhoto Jatra.On the occasion of the festival, a public holiday has been declared in the three districts of Kathmandu Valley [Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur], according to a statement by Narayan Prasad Bhattarai, spokesperson for the Ministry of Home Affairs, on Friday.The government announces a public holiday each year on this occasion.The month-long chariot-pulling festival of Rato Machhindranath concludes with the displaying of a bhoto (a jewel-studded vest) at Jawalakhel, Lalitpur. It is an annual cultural and religious ritual of displaying the black jewel-studded vest believed to be of then Nagraj, the serpent King.Machhindranath is revered as the God of rain, good harvest and prosperity.

The company makes Rs450 million in transactions annually and has a Rs1 billion worth of production capacity in case of high demand.Rijal opened his own company after having worked in a dalmoth factory.“My uncle Tej Kumar opened a dalmoth factory at Urlabari, in eastern Nepal, in 1980,” said Rijal. He worked there in 1982.To sell the dalmoth produced at his uncle’s factory, Rijal travelled to many places around the country. While visiting Chitwan for sales, he saw the possibility of producing and selling dalmoth independently. In 1987, Rijal started the groundwork.In December 1987, he started production at his son-in-law’s house by frying it in a pan.Initially, the son-in-law helped Rijal. After a year, his brothers, too, joined him.Rijal then started to expand the business. “I learned the craft from production to sales and keeping accounts while working with my uncle. I had built a good network in the market. The skills I learned gave me confidence to start my own production,” he said.He visited Chitwan to Butwal and Tanahun to Bimalnagar to sell dalmoth.“My brother saw the potential every time he came to Chitwan from the eastern region to sell dalmoth. The bridge on the Narayani river had just been constructed. Narayangadh-Muglin road was being operated. All this gave him the thought of expanding the business from here,” said Purushottam Rijal, Rajendra's brother.At that time, raw materials of dalmoth could be brought on credit while the finished product sold in cash.Initially, Rijal introduced his products under the brand name ‘Shantkamal’. After six years, in 1993, he registered his firm as ‘Rijal Foods’ and started production. To give the firm a corporate structure, he renamed the company Rijal Food and Beverage Private Limited in 2015. That year, he bought 22 kattha land at Belshi, Ratnanagar municipality.There is a production plant on ten katthas. The remaining land is being used for storage.The factory currently produces 25 types of snacks, including bhujiya, chips, and furandana. The company sells snacks in 10-gram packages to 800-gram packages.“Our products reached across the country. We have 190 dealers from Taplejung in the east to Darchula in the west,” said Purushottam, the managing director.He said that the company's popular products are dalmoth, bhujiya, and chips. Made with whole dry chillies, peanuts, pieces of ginger, and curry leaves on beaten rice, furandana from Rijal Foods is consumed mostly by field and office workers.Consumers are attracted to products by their quality and packaging. Considering this, the company has adopted advanced techniques of production and packaging, said Purushottam.Rapid urbanisation has made shopping malls and department stores ubiquitous. Indian dalmoth and bhujiya brands are highly visible in these shopping centres.Nepali dalmoth used to be produced in a small area. The packaging was poor, and the marketing was not aggressive.“We were enrolled in the VAT system in 1997. This benefited us in getting support from a project in Denmark to produce unadulterated and qualitative products. For three months, they guided us,” Purushottam said.“The project helped us learn efficient fuel-saving methods, which helped increase productivity, packaging and marketing.”Rijal brothers often visited Rajasthan, India, mainly to observe various dalmoth and bhujiya factories. They even attended dalmoth and bhujiya-related fairs in India.This helped the Rijals learn about the equipment and technology used in similar factories.In 2011, Purushottam started using new technology for dalmoth production. Purushottam said that snacks like dalmoth, bhujiya, and Rijal chips have a 22 percent share of the Nepali market. Rijal's snack products have reached countries such as Italy, Belgium, Portugal, Malta, Germany, France, Australia and Japan, among others.Rajendra’s sons Swarup and Saurabh also produce pickles, ketchup, and sauce under the Rijal brand. \nWith the celebration of Janai Purnima on Monday, Nepal’s festive season has officially kicked off, and traders are hopeful that consumer demand will pick up, giving a much needed boost to the ailing economy.As the country’s key festivals, Dashain, Tihar, and Chhath, approach, traders have started placing orders in foreign markets.The festive season in Nepal traditionally sparks a significant surge in consumer spending, driving demand for everything from new clothes and jewellery to home appliances and vehicles, and propelling the retail and manufacturing sectors.Local businesses launch massive sales campaigns. The festive season in Nepal is a perfect mixture of cultural celebration and economic activity.The economic slowdown had dampened the festival season last year, but traders say they are optimistic this year.While there is no official data on festival spending, economic activity in Nepal peaks during September-November. Some economists estimate that 40 to 70 percent of market activities occur around these three key festivals.It is estimated that many people save throughout the year to spend during these festivals.Business houses, banks, and government officials receive bonuses for the festivals, and suppliers are keen to capitalise on the anticipated increase in demand.Last Dashain, the cash crunch forced consumers to cut back on purchases. But this year, banks have sufficient liquidity, and traders are optimistic about sales growth.Ramu Paudel, spokesperson at Nepal Rastra Bank, the country’s central bank, said that the trend of opening letters of credit (LC) to import goods ahead of the festive season has been promising.“Based on this trend, we also expect a rise in international trade this year.” Nepal's imports declined for two consecutive fiscal years, reversing several years of surging imports.According to the central bank, merchandise imports decreased 1.2 percent to Rs1.59 trillion in the last fiscal year that ended mid-July, against a decrease of 16.1 percent a year ago. Earlier, Nepal's imports declined by 7.2 percent in the fiscal year 2001-02.The Post talked to a few traders about the demand outlook.Automobile dealers are particularly optimistic and excited about this year’s festive sales.“The automobile business slowed down after the pandemic. However, the growing demand for electric vehicles (EVs) has made us hopeful this year,” said Puskar Ojha, vice president of Nepal Automobile Dealers’ Association.“The banks have enough liquidity and are ready to lend, especially for EVs. We hope EV sales will rise by 25 percent this festive season,” he said. EV sales cover 50-60 percent of the overall automobile market share. The association is organising the NADA Auto Show 2024 from August 27 to September 1. The show is expected to draw 75,000 visitors.“The new government has brought hope, and the market is also turning positive, so the overall sales of automobiles are expected to rise this festive season,” said Ojha.Automobile traders said that new models and variants of two-wheelers and four-wheelers have started arriving in the market, targeting the auto show. In the last fiscal year, Nepal’s gross foreign exchange reserves increased 32.6 percent to Rs2.04 trillion, a historic high fueled by remittance inflows of Rs1.44 trillion, the highest amount on record.The distributors of consumer electronic goods are also optimistic and excited about extravagant festive sales.Alok Gupta, general manager of Samsung Consumer Electronic Goods, said, “There is optimism in the market.” “Observing the greening of the share market has given most businesses, including us, a sense of hope.”He said they anticipated a 25 percent growth in consumer home appliance sales this festive season.“There is a slowdown in market activities, but since banks have sufficient liquidity, it provides hope for all,” Gupta said. According to Him Electronics, the authorised distributor of Samsung electronics goods in Nepal, the company is launching new TVs, refrigerators, and washing machines just in time for the Dashain. The new offers are expected to be introduced at the beginning of September.“As we target 25 percent growth in sales, we plan for a good price offer to boost the sales. So, consumer electronic goods will not be expensive this festive season.” Bharat Karki, vice president of Nepal Trans Himalaya Border Commerce Association, said that imports of readymade garments, raw materials for apparel and shoes, as well as mobile phones and accessories have risen by 40 percent this year, mainly targeted for the festival season.“We have seen a rise in the number of distributors coming to Kathmandu and placing orders this year.”“The demand may not reach the pre-Covid levels, but it’s improving.” He said 40 cargo containers enter Nepal daily from the northern border points, loaded with festive goods.However, there are complaints from traders in New Road, once a major shopping hub.Kumar Karki, president of the Federation of National Traders Nepal, said that businesses in New Road may face repercussions since the Kathmandu Metropolitan City has not allowed roadside parking.“Shopper footfall has already dropped. Due to the parking restriction, we are not very optimistic about the upcoming festive sales.”According to Nepal Rastra Bank, the country's readymade garment imports increased 35.9 percent to Rs33.26 billion in the last fiscal year. The inflation of clothes and footwear remained at 4.56 percent. \nA World Health Organization official stressed on Tuesday that mpox, regardless of whether it is the new or old strain, is not the new Covid, as authorities know how to control its spread.“We can and must tackle mpox together,” said Hans Kluge, WHO regional director for Europe, in a UN media briefing.“So will we choose to put the systems in place to control and eliminate mpox globally? Or we will enter another cycle of panic and neglect? How we respond now and in the years to come will prove a critical test for Europe and the world,” he added.Mpox, a viral infection that causes pus-filled lesions and flu-like symptoms, is usually mild but can kill.The clade 1b variety has caused global concern because it seems to spread more easily through routine close contact.A case of the variant was confirmed last week in Sweden and linked to a growing outbreak in Africa, the first sign of its spread outside the continent. The WHO declared the recent outbreak of the disease a public health emergency of international concern after the new variant was identified.Kluge said that the focus on the new clade 1 strain will also help in the fight against the less severe clade 2 variety that has spreading globally since 2022, allowing Europe to improve its response through better health advice and surveillance.About 100 new cases of the clade 2 mpox strain are now being reported in the European region every month, added Kluge.Mpox transmits through close physical contact, including sexual contact, but unlike previous global pandemics such as Covid-19, there is no evidence it spreads easily through the air.Health authorities need to be on alert and flexible in case there are new, more transmissible clades or ones that change their transmission route, but there are no recommendations for people to wear masks, said WHO spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic. \nThe 500 rapid diagnostic test kits supplied by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division to the Anbukhaireni Rural Municipality of Tanahun two weeks ago were used up within two days.Along with the test kits, the division also issued directives to launch a search-and-destroy drive, mobilise female community health volunteers, and deploy social workers to destroy the breeding grounds for the disease vectors.Despite the rural municipality grappling with a massive dengue outbreak, with over 1,000 positive cases in a single ward within a month, the federal government's central disease control body has yet to dispatch an expert team to conduct vector surveillance. Health workers at the local unit said that they expect federal agencies to monitor health facilities overwhelmed with infected patients and ensure that preventive measures have been properly enforced.“More than the directives, we need test kits, essential medicines and health workers to care for the patients in our hospitals,” Agam Raj Upadhyaya, health coordinator of the rural municipality, told the Post over the phone from Anbukhaireni. “Neither the Ministry of Health and Population of the federal government nor the agencies under the provincial government have taken the issue seriously, even after a massive dengue outbreak hit the entire local unit.”Health workers in the virus-hit local unit said that over 50 people test positive for the dengue virus daily in Aanbukhaireni Rural Municipality alone. Local health facilities are struggling to cope with the overwhelming number of seriously ailing people. Patients are being treated on benches and even on the floors of health facilities, according to health officials working at the municipality. Some patients go to Chitwan, Pokhara, and even Kathmandu for treatment.“Due to a human resource crunch, we have pulled health workers from peripheral health posts to help in hospitals overwhelmed with dengue patients,” said Upadhyaya. “Over 45 patients are being treated in a 15-bed hospital. We expect help from provincial and federal government agencies to care for seriously ailing patients.”Health workers said they are doing their best to contain the spread of the deadly disease, but their measures, including the search-and-destroy drive, have become ineffective. Officials concede that the drive was launched only after the massive outbreak of the virus, and the ongoing rainfall has been hindering the measures taken to destroy the breeding grounds of mosquitoes.”Officials admit that the actual number of dengue cases could be higher as people with mild symptoms are not getting tested and are resting at home.What worries health workers the most is that with the spike in positive cases, they also see an increase in seriously ill patients.Officials admit that the real number of infections could be several times higher, as the government’s case reporting system is not very effective, and more than 80 percent of the cases are asymptomatic.Public health experts say that the ongoing spread of dengue infection could have been prevented had the authorities concerned taken the problems seriously and launched the search-and-destroy drive.“How can we expect to prevent the spread of the virus by waiting to take measures until there is a massive outbreak of the disease?” asked Dr Baburam Marasini, a public health expert. “We have created only the agencies to give directions, not the ones to take action. Agencies under the federal government must help local units carry out surveillance, determine the serotype of the virus and provide care to patients.”Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika, according to the World Health Organisation.So far this year, two died, and 3,755 tested positive for the dengue virus that has spread in 74 districts across the country.Public health experts warn that dengue cases could escalate in the coming days in other districts as well, as heavy rainfall continues across the country and post-monsoons season, which is considered the main dengue season, is yet to start.Experts say a massive awareness campaign is instrumental in destroying the breeding ground of the dengue-spreading vector, and the public must be made aware of the treatment.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects such as plastic cups and bottles could be breeding grounds for dengue-carrying mosquitoes.According to doctors, mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache and pain in the eyes are some of the symptoms of dengue. Doctors advise that those with these symptoms should seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and access to proper medical care can lower fatalities.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district. Since then, an increasing number of dengue infections and major outbreaks have been reported from many districts. \nNepal witnessed an alarming rise in the suicide cases in the last fiscal year.According to data provided by the Nepal Police, 7,223 people killed themselves in the fiscal year 2023-024, which is the highest ever recorded in a year.“Around 20 people killed themselves on an average every 24-hour in the last fiscal year,” said Dr Pomawati Thapa, chief of the Non-communicable Disease and Mental Health Section at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “The number is the highest ever recorded in any fiscal year.”Nepal is among the countries with the highest suicide rates.Police data show that 6,993 people killed themselves in the fiscal year 2022-023, followed by 6,792 in the fiscal year 2021-022.As many as 7,117 people took their own lives in the fiscal year 2020-021, during which the country witnessed the second and third wave of the coronavirus pandemic. Reducing one-third of premature mortality from non-communicable diseases through prevention, treatment and promotion of mental health and well-being is among the UN-backed Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) targets to which Nepal is committed.Experts say the suicide rate is an indicator of premature mortality within the SDGs, which are a follow-up to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).“At the time when the government committed to SDGs in 2015, around 16 people took their own lives every 24 hours,” said Basudev Karki, a consultant psychiatrist. “Now the number has risen to 20. Our government had committed to reduce the suicide rate to 9.7 per 100,000 each year by 2022, but this number rose to 24, and last year it increased further to 25.”The government aims to reduce the suicide rate to 4.7 per 100,000 population by 2030 to meet the SDG targets, but as the deadline nears, more people are killing themselves every day. Mental health experts say people do not attempt suicide for any single reason, but rather due to a complex mix of factors including the rising cost of living and struggle to manage even their most basic needs such as food, housing, healthcare, and job security.Whatever the cause, suicides and suicide attempts have a ripple effect, impacting not only the individual but also families, friends, colleagues, communities, and societies, according to themA study carried out by the Nepal Health Research Council before the start of the pandemic shows that more than 10 percent of the adult population had mental issues in their lifetime and 4.3 percent were undergoing some sort of mental crisis.The prevalence of suicidality, including current suicidal thoughts, past suicide attempts, and a future likelihood of suicidal thoughts, was found to be prevalent in the 7.2 percent population.“Even those individuals who appear healthy on the outside could also be struggling with serious mental health problems,” said Karki. “People generally do not like to talk about mental health issues due to the social stigma attached, and lack of awareness. To tackle the growing mental health problems, authorities concerned have to take multiple approaches.”Meanwhile, officials at the Ministry of Health and Population said that they are aware of the growing burden of mental health issues and the rising suicide rate and have been taking various measures to address the problems.“Along with providing free medications for mental health problems at state-run health facilities, we have been taking several other measures that include imparting mental health screening training for health workers,” said Thapa, chief of the Non-communicable Disease and Mental Health Section at the division. “We have been working to declare two local units—Palungtar Municipality of Gorkha and Bagchaur Municipality of Salyan—as model municipalities for mental health.”According to officials, various mental health programmes will be rolled out in these local units, including screening for mental health problems and training for health workers, community workers, teachers, female community health volunteers, and others. Awareness campaigns will be launched, and health facilities will be strengthened to provide basic services for mental health problems.“This programme will be launched as a pilot and will be gradually expanded to other local units,” said Thapa. “The main aim of the programme is to encourage the local bodies to take responsibility for addressing the growing mental health issues. We will also launch an awareness drive to reduce the suicide rate, alcohol consumption, and substance use.”The World Health Organisation says one in four people in the world are affected by mental or neurological disorders at some point in their lives, and around 450 million people currently suffer from such conditions, placing mental disorders among the leading causes of ill health and disability worldwide.If you or someone you know is considering suicide, please contact the following helplines.Nepal Mental Hospital suicide hotline: 1166Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital suicide prenvention hotline: 9840021600:Patan Hospital crisis helpline for suicide prevention: 9813476123The Transcultural Psychosocial Organisation: 16600102005 \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar. \nThe noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built. Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nNepal made sure they entered into the semi-finals of the SAFF U-20 Championship as group winners as they defeated Bangladesh 2-1 at the ANFA Complex in Satdobato, Lalitpur on Thursday.Samir Tamang and Nirajan Dhami scored two quick goals for Nepal in the first half, which sealed the victory for the Gorkhalis.Two wins in as many matches gave Nepal six points and a summit finish in Group A. They will face the runners-up of Group B in the last four at the Dasharath Stadium.India will meet the Maldives in the last match of Group B on Friday.India and Bhutan have three points each. The Maldives lost their opening match to Bhutan 2-1 on Wednesday. However, Bhutan will be secretly praying that the Maldivians lose against India so that they could qualify for their third semi-finals.The Maldives will progress into the knockouts if they defeat defending champions India, who are also the winners of the last three editions of the championship.Both Nepal and Bangladesh were already assured of their places in the last four after winning their opening group games against Sri Lanka, who crashed out after two consecutive defeats.Nepal started the game confidently and got to work right away with the lead after 17 minutes, thanks to a howler from Bangladesh captain and goalkeeper Md Mehdi Hasan Srabon.Srabon had come far off the post, and with no immediate threats surrounding him, the goalkeeper only had a simple job of taking care of an incoming ball coming from the other end. But the overconfident goalie took the moment too lightly that allowed Tamang to sprint between two unaware defenders, seize possession of the ball off the helpless Srabon and score into an empty net.And when Bangladesh had not even finished thinking how glaring their mistake was, their plight doubled as Mohsin Ahmed’s attempt to stay clear of a cross from Abinash Syangtan went into his own post.Bangladesh’s first attempt at goal came in the 27th minute when Md Ashraful Haque Asif arrowed a venomous shot from distance but Nepal goalkeeper Jiyarat Shekh was alert and made a diving save to foil the effort.Dhami had an opportunity to take his tournament goal tally to three in the 36th minute, but his header off a precise cross from Niraj Karki could not find the target.Bangladesh reduced the deficit in the 43rd minute through a penalty kick that was awarded to them after Ram Thapa and Ashwin Ghorasainee sandwiched Mirajul Islam and brought the opponent player down inside their own penalty area.Mirajul stepped up and made no mistake from the spot kick.The second half was largely a drab affair.Despite conceding, Nepal were happy to sit back and defend after the restart.But Bangladesh could not shake a strong Nepal defence until the final seconds of the five-minute stoppage time.Md Rostom Islam Dukhu Mia’s header off a cross from Md Rabby Hossen Rahul almost snatched an equaliser but Nepal’s netkeeper Shekh stretched full length to preserve Nepal’s lead.Coach Urjan Shrestha and Nepal are aiming to break India’s latest dominance in the championship by winning their third SAFF age-group championship trophy. \nPortugal’s Cristiano Ronaldo launched his YouTube channel on Wednesday and hundreds of thousands of subscribers signed up within a couple of hours.The 39-year-old five-times Ballon D’Or winner plays for Saudi Arabian club Al Nassr.“The wait is over. My @YouTube channel is finally here! SIUUUbscribe and join me on this new journey,” Ronaldo posted on his social media accounts.A couple of hours after posting his first video, 1.69M subscribers had joined the channel.Ronaldo has 112.5 million followers on the X platform, 170 million on Facebook and 636 million on Instagram.The former Real Madrid and Manchester United player is preparing for his team’s Saudi Pro League opener against Al-Raed on Thursday. \nIndia’s Narendra Modi arrived in wartime Kyiv on Friday to hold talks with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the first trip by an Indian prime minister to Ukraine since Kyiv gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.The visit comes at a volatile juncture in the war in Ukraine, with Ukrainian forces still in Russia’s western Kursk region following their incursion on August 6 and Russian troops grinding out slow but steady advances in Ukraine’s east.The visit, which follows a trip by Modi to Moscow in July, is important for Western-backed Kyiv, which has been trying to nurture diplomatic relations in the Global South in its efforts to secure a fair settlement to end the war.“Reached Kyiv earlier this morning. The Indian community accorded a very warm welcome,” Modi wrote on X. The Ukrainian railways company showed footage of him stepping off a train carriage and being received by Ukrainian officials.In the run-up to the trip, he said he was looking forward to sharing “perspectives on peaceful resolution of the ongoing Ukraine conflict”.Modi’s visit to Moscow last month coincided with a heavy Russian missile strike on Ukraine that hit a children’s hospital. The attack prompted Modi to use emotive language to deliver an implicit rebuke to Putin at their summit.But the trip elicited fierce criticism from Zelenskiy who said it was a “huge disappointment and a devastating blow to peace efforts to see the leader of the world’s largest democracy hug the world’s most bloody criminal in Moscow on such a day”.Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser in the Ukrainian president’s office, told Reuters Modi’s visit to Kyiv was significant because New Delhi “really has a certain influence” over Moscow.“It’s extremely important for us to effectively build relations with such countries, to explain to them what the correct end to the war is - and that it is also in their interests,” he said.India, which has traditionally had close economic and defence ties with Moscow, has publicly criticised the deaths of innocent people in the war.But it has also strengthened its economic ties with Moscow after Western nations imposed sanctions on Russia and cut trade relations with it over the invasion.Indian refiners which rarely bought Russian oil in the past have emerged as Moscow’s top clients for sea-borne oil since Russia poured troops into Ukraine in February 2022. Russian oil accounts for over two-fifths of India’s oil imports.PEACE VISIONUkraine has said it hopes to bring together a second international summit later this year to advance its vision of peace and involve representatives from Russia.The first summit in Switzerland that pointedly excluded Russia in June attracted scores of delegations, including one from India, but not from China, the world’s second-largest economy.“Lasting peace can only be achieved through options that are acceptable to both parties. And it can only be a negotiated settlement,” Tanmaya Lal, Secretary (West) in the Indian foreign ministry, told reporters.“This is an important visit that is expected to catalyze our ties in a whole range of sectors,” Lal said, listing economic and business links, agriculture, infrastructure, health and education, pharmaceuticals, defence and culture.Volodymyr Fesenko, a Kyiv-based political analyst, said he expected no breakthrough proposals to be made to end the war during the trip by Modi, who visited Poland on Thursday.For there to be an attempt to negotiate, the military situation has to stabilise and the presidential election must be held in the United States, a close ally of Ukraine, he said.He said the visit was important for India to demonstrate it was “not on Russia’s side” and that Kyiv wanted to normalise relations after Modi’s Moscow trip. \nVice President Kamala Harris formally accepted the Democratic nomination for president on Thursday with a rousing call to end the war in Gaza and to fight tyranny around the world, drawing a sharp contrast with Republican Donald Trump.“In the enduring struggle between democracy and tyranny, I know where I stand and I know where the United States belongs,” Harris said, accusing Trump of bowing down to dictators.On the final, and most anticipated, night of the four-day Chicago convention, Harris, 59, promised to chart a “New Way Forward” as she and Trump, 78, enter the final 11 weeks of the razor-close campaign.Harris emerged as the Democratic candidate little more than a month ago when allies of President Joe Biden, 81, forced him to quit the race.It was a forceful speech for a candidate who, during her brief campaign, had yet to articulate much of her vision for the country and faced a stream of personal attacks from Trump, who mocked her Black and South Asian heritage and called her weak on the foreign stage.The speech laid out some broad policy principles, foreign and domestic, but left unsaid specific details which in weeks to come she could be pressured to provide.After days of protests from Palestinian supporters who were disappointed at not getting a speaking spot at the convention, Harris delivered a pledge to secure Israel, bring the hostages home from Gaza and end the war in the Palestinian enclave.“Now is the time to get a hostage deal and a ceasefire deal done,” she said to cheers. “And let me be clear, I will always stand up for Israel’s right to defend itself and I will always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself.”“What has happened in Gaza over the past 10 months is devastating. So many innocent lives lost, desperate hungry people fleeing for safety over and over again. The scale of suffering is heartbreaking,” she said.“President Biden and I are working to end this war such that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom and self-determination.”In some of her strongest foreign policy statements to date, Harris said she would take whatever action was necessary to defend US interests against Iran and would not cosy up to tyrants and dictators.She said such leaders, including North Korea’s Kim Jong Un, “are rooting for Trump.”She vowed to stand with Ukraine in its war against Russia and with NATO allies.HARRIS WOULD BE FIRST FEMALE US PRESIDENTIf successful, Harris stands to make history as the first woman elected US president.She described the November 5 election as a “precious, fleeting opportunity to move past the bitterness, cynicism and divisive battles of the past. A chance to chart a New Way Forward.”Harris drew a series of contrasts with Trump, accusing him of not fighting for the middle class, planning to enact a tax hike through his tariff proposals, and having set in motion the end of a constitutional right to abortion with his picks for the US Supreme Court.Harris noted the Supreme Court’s recent ruling about presidential immunity and the risks that would engender if Trump gained power again.“Just imagine Donald Trump with no guard rails,” she said.Trump, who had promised to respond to Harris’ speech in real-time, posted a series of messages on Truth Social as she spoke about him, including: “She stands for Incompetence and Weakness – Our Country is being laughed at all over the World!” and “She will never be respected by the Tyrants of the World!”FINAL NIGHTChicago’s United Center brimmed with energy – and people. The arena’s 23,500 seats were filled and arena staff briefly blocked more people from entering the facility, saying the city’s fire marshal declared the building at capacity.After Harris ended her speech, 100,000 balloons descended on the crowd, a convention official said. Inflating them took 75 volunteers, 30 staff members and a dozen unionized stagehands.Biden called Harris to wish her luck before her speech, a White House spokesperson said.On Thursday night, Harris said she will pass a middle tax cut that will benefit more than 100 million Americans.She discussed her plans to fight for abortion rights, voting rights legislation, boost the housing supply and ban what she has called “price gouging” by grocers. Her campaign has also proposed raising the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%.Before the speech, thousands of Palestinian supporters once again gathered to protest US support for Israel as it wages war in Gaza. The issue is one of the most divisive among Democrats and got little attention at the convention, which could hurt Democrats at the polls.Delegates from the Uncommitted National Movement, which mobilized nearly 750,000 voters to withhold support for Biden during the presidential primaries, entered the venue linking arms and took their seats. Members spent Wednesday night on the sidewalk outside the convention to protest the DNC’s rejection of their request for a Palestinian speaker.Harris has raised a record-breaking $500 million in a month and narrowed the gap or taken the lead against Trump in many opinion polls of battleground states. Nationwide, she leads Trump 46.6% to 43.8%, according to a compilation of polls by FiveThirtyEight. \nThe daughter of a Jamaican father and Indian mother, both immigrants, Kamala Harris reflects the United States’ changing demographics.When she steps onto the stage Thursday evening in Chicago to accept the Democratic Party’s nomination as their presidential candidate, she will represent the country’s fastest-growing racial category.Some 42 million Americans now identify as multiracial, or 13% of the country, according to the US Census Bureau. That is up from 2% in 2000 when the census first allowed people to select multiple races.America has long been a self-styled “melting pot” of people who trace their origins around the world, but in practice some states legally segregated citizens by race until the civil rights laws of the 1960s and laws prohibiting interracial marriage were not overturned until 1967.Social change since, though, has been rapid. Barack Obama was elected as the country’s first Black president in 2008, and Harris would be the first Black woman and South Asian if elected in November.“We’re living in a situation 50 years later where we could be looking at our second mixed-race president, and it’s beautiful,” said Svante Myrick, president of People for the American Way, an advocacy group, whose father was Black and his mother white.America’s future will look even more diverse. The vast majority of multiracial people are younger than 44 and a third are still children.The trend has been met by confusion, upset and worse from some of the US’s shrinking white majority. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump drew groans at a gathering of Black journalists last month when he falsely portrayed Harris as pivoting from Indian to Black.“I don’t know, is she Indian or is she Black,” Trump said. “But you know what, I respect either one.”Harris has long identified with both her parents’ ancestry. In Trump’s remarks, some multiracial people saw echoes of their own experience of being asked to choose one or the other.Harris’ upbringing makes her a better leader for America, Democrats in Chicago said.“When you have individuals who carry multiple experiences in the same person, that's an asset,” said Representative Maxwell Frost, who is Lebanese, Puerto Rican and Haitian, speaking at a Politico event on the sidelines of the convention. “That enhances her ability to legislate and advocate\" on behalf of a broad range of Americans.The Harris campaign did not respond to a request for comment, nor did spokespeople for Trump.As the US becomes more diverse and multicultural, white nationalist groups continue to thrive online, pushing conspiracy theories such as the “The Great Replacement”, while some Republican lawmakers have focused on banning books and cancelling classes focused on racial history.Thousands of racial hate crimes are reported yearly, with 232 aimed at people of multiple races in 2022, the most recent year for which FBI data is available.“Unfortunately, we’re really into a period of backlash,” said Matthew Belmont, a Dartmouth College history professor who has studied the demographic trend, despite the 2020 election of Harris as vice president and her administration's elevation of racial justice priorities.Tara Betrayer, an Afro-Latina and white conservative co-founder of political action committee the Seneca Project, said she was once attracted to the Republican Party in part because of its emphasis on color-blind policies.“Do Democrats take it too far at times with racial identity politics? Well, yeah,” she said.Now an independent, Betrayer said some of the Republican Party’s recent rhetoric on issues including illegal migration carried undercurrents of racism. Republicans reject those criticisms, saying their focus on border controls are aimed at securing the country for all Americans.“This is really their last gasp at trying to stop the country from evolving, and I think they’re missing out on something that’s beautiful,” Betrayer said. \nIndonesia’s parliament postponed ratifying changes to an elections law on Thursday amid protests in multiple cities, following outcry over legislation seen to strengthen the political influence of outgoing President Joko Widodo.The plenary session to pass the changes was delayed due to a lack of a quorum, legislator Habiburokhman told reporters outside the parliament building.It is unclear if parliament will reconvene to pass the law before the registration for regional elections opens next Tuesday.The parliament planned to ratify changes that would have reversed a ruling by the constitutional court earlier this week. The legislative changes would have blocked a vocal government critic in the race for the influential post of Jakarta governor and also paved the way for Widodo’s youngest son to run in elections in Java this November.The power struggle between the parliament and the judiciary comes amid a week of dramatic political developments in the world’s third-largest democracy and in the final stretch of the president’s second term.Widodo downplayed the concerns, saying on Wednesday the court ruling and parliamentary deliberations were part of standard “checks and balances” .The home affairs minister said the changes were intended to provide legal certainty.More than 1,000 demonstrators gathered on Thursday outside the parliament building in Jakarta and across multiple cities in Java, some holding banners accusing Jokowi of destroying democracy. Authorities fired tear gas at demonstrators in Semarang, according to footage from Kompas TV.“This is the peak of my disdain,” said Afif Sidik, a 29-year-old teacher who joined the protest outside parliament.“This is a republic. It’s a democracy, but if its leadership is decided by one person, or an oligarch, we can’t accept that.”Legal experts and political analysts have described the power struggle as bordering on a constitutional crisis.Elections analyst Titi Anggraini characterised the manoeuvre as “constitutional insubordination”.The street protests follow a wave of criticism online, with blue posters featuring the words “Emergency Warning” above Indonesia’s national eagle proliferating on social media.The rupiah and Jakarta’s main stock index (.JKSE), slumped by midday Thursday, hit by concerns of protests as well as the country’s widening current account deficit.‘THIS IS A POWER STRUGGLE’The Constitutional Court on Tuesday revoked a minimum threshold requirement to nominate candidates in regional elections and kept the minimum age limit of 30 years for candidates.That ruling effectively blocks the candidacy of the president’s 29-year-old son from contesting the race for deputy governor in Central Java, and would allow Anies Baswedan, the current favourite, to run in Jakarta.But within 24 hours the parliament had tabled an emergency revision to annul the changes.All parties except one, the Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P), have agreed to the revision of the law.“Indonesian democracy is once again at a crucial crossroads,” Anies posted on social media platform X, urging legislators to remember its fate rested in their hands.The parliament is now dominated by a big-tent coalition aligned to the outgoing president, popularly known as Jokowi, and president-elect Prabowo Subianto.Prabowo, who won a landslide victory in February’s elections, will be inaugurated on Oct. 20, with Jokowi's eldest son, Gibran Rakabuming Raka, as his vice president.Jokowi is facing mounting criticism for the increasingly bold ways his government is consolidating power, and over the creation of his own political dynasty.“The ruling of the constitutional court is final and binding,” said Bivitri Susanti, from the Jentera School of Law, “It is not possible for the legislative body to violate the judiciary's ruling. This is a power struggle.”First elected in 2014, Jokowi was at the time hailed as a democratic hero, in large part because he was seen as untethered from the country’s entrenched oligarchy and military elite.The president has been praised for his solid economic record but increasingly criticised for the democratic decline of the country’s institutions during his decade in office. \nAt least 17 people were killed in an explosion on Thursday at a pharmaceuticals manufacturing plant in southern India’s Andhra Pradesh state, a district government official said.The fire broke out in the afternoon at privately held Escientia Advanced Sciences’ 40-acre manufacturing unit that was operational since 2019 in the state’s Anakapalli district, according to district collector Vijaya Krishnan.“The injured have been shifted to nearby hospitals...it appears that there could have been a blast at the chemical reactor,” Krishnan’s office told Reuters, adding that the blast occurred during lunchtime at the unit.Nearly 40 people were injured and rescue operations had been completed, the official, Industries Secretary N. Yuvaraj, told Reuters.Escientia did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The state government has ordered an inquiry into the incident.Officials said they were scanning closed-circuit television footage and questioning the injured to decide if human error was responsible for the blast.“Preliminary investigation shows ... there was some vapour leak that led to chemical reactions, which caused the explosion,” added Yuvaraj, who identified the solvent involved as methyl tert-butyl ether.In a post on X, Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered condolences to the relatives of the dead.India, known as the pharmacy of the world, is home to many plants that make pharmaceuticals.Last year, two people were killed and five others were injured in a similar fire accident that broke out in a solvent reactor at a unit of Sahithi Pharma in the Anakapalli district. \nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nWhat animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. \nNepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) \nEducation diplomacy is a powerful tool for establishing mutually beneficial relationships between nations. It involves strategically using diplomatic skills and practices to build and maintain relationships and collaborations, fostering partnerships among various stakeholders to achieve common goals in the education sector. Countries view educational opportunities for international students as a critical strategy for advancing their soft power agendas. However, Nepal has yet to realise its value, as the outcry of international students facing visa-related and other issues in Nepal has still not received sufficient attention among policymakers and educators.A nation's internationalisation policy in higher education is crucial in promoting economic growth and projecting goodwill toward other nations. For example, China has successfully utilised public diplomacy, culture and international education as soft power instruments. The country attracted 255,720 students in 2021 alone by presenting a peaceful and friendly image of its growing economy. China's success is partly attributed to its seven universities, which are ranked in the latest Times Higher Education’s global top 100 world rankings. In contrast, India's foreign student population, which was approximately 46,000 in 2021-22, remains much lower than that of leading countries like the United States (US), the United Kingdom and Australia, indicating that the government hasn’t fully capitalised on this diplomatic tool. However, India has made a notable progress, as there has been an increase of nearly 42 percent in foreign student enrollment over the past seven years. As part of its rebranding as a net aid provider, India has emphasised education diplomacy by reducing incoming aid, increasing foreign assistance and promoting internationalisation in higher education through initiatives like scholarships, the South Asia University proposal and global outreach expansion through institutions like Indira Gandhi National Open University.Cultural diversity is a vital aspect of education diplomacy. Many countries, like the US, China and India, engage in extensive cultural exchange programmes rather than just awarding degrees. The International Visitors Leadership Programme (IVLP), a premier professional exchange initiative of the US Department of State, is one of the oldest programmes. Every year, nearly 5,000 International Visitors participate in the IVLP. Through short-term visits to the US, current and emerging foreign leaders in various fields gain firsthand experience and build strong relationships with their American counterparts. Similarly, China fosters cultural exchanges through the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), while India has institutions like the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) to promote cultural interactions.Education diplomacy is becoming a significant revenue source for governments. Attracting international students by signing a memorandum of understanding with various universities contributes to the universities' reach, reputation and revenue. When a nation positions itself as a higher education centre, its global influence increases. As more international students enrol in higher education institutions (HEIs), the institution's reputation will amplify, aiding in branding and internationalisation. The influx of foreign students also provides a substantial revenue stream for the host country. India is working to internationalise its education system by promoting students, faculties, programmes and campus mobility; all these initiatives support education diplomacy. For instance, an Indian student studying in Nepal will be exposed to the Nepali lifestyle and culture, fostering cultural understanding and bonding between the two countries. Attracting international students can also create a broad base of supporters.Status of Nepali universitiesNepali universities’ efforts in international relations and collaborations are far from encouraging. With the mass exodus of students abroad, the situation is bleak. There is no evaluation or national ranking system for Nepali HEIs, making it difficult to achieve even moderate rankings globally. The main issue with Nepali HEIs is employability rather than the quality of education. While universities are experiencing low enrollment, no concerted efforts have been made to compensate for this loss by attracting international students to Nepal. Additional challenges include low investment in research and innovation and a lack of competent faculty, leading to fewer university collaborations worldwide. Procedural challenges such as unclear visa policies and difficulties opening bank accounts and payments aggravate the situation. There is also ambiguity regarding the status of dependents or family members accompanying students while coming to Nepal.Despite the inherent challenges, Kathmandu University (KU) has taken steps to promote internationalisation. For example, foreign faculty members are offered a salary 1.5 times higher than local faculties, a modest effort to attract international talent. The Vice-Chancellor Scholarship Scheme has been introduced, providing scholarships to at least one foreign student in each school based on merit. Moreover, KU is running several programmes in collaboration with international HEIs, such as the M-Tech in Energy Systems (KU-Indian Institute Of Technology (IIT) Madras, India), Bachelor in Yogic Science and Well-being (KU-Sri Visweswara Yoga Research Institute, Tirupati, India), Bachelor of Information Technology (KU-Crown Institute of Higher Education, Australia) and a Joint PhD Program (KU-IIT Hyderabad), among others.Role of stakeholdersTo unleash Nepal’s education sector's potential, continuous support from a robust policy ecosystem, institutional strengthening, and increased investment are required. Although education diplomacy has been limited so far, Nepali diplomats must proactively find solutions. In other countries, presidents or heads of state often visit HEIs to assess the situation and initiate educational activities; however, such practices are uncommon among Nepali diplomats. The government should immediately work to ensure a smooth and hassle-free entry process for students wishing to study in Nepal. Necessary steps should be taken to make it easier for foreign students to pay tuition and other fees. The process for converting tourist or visit visas to student visas should be expedited. Universities should also provide insurance for foreign students, ensuring their sense of security in a new country. Moreover, universities should mobilise the Nepali diaspora and alums community to market local courses in niche areas, increasing global awareness and interest in Nepali Universities. \nOn August 14, 2024, the House of Representatives (HoR) passed the bill to amend the “Enforced Disappearances Enquiry” and “Truth and Reconciliation Commission” Acts 2014 without substantial debate, undermining the rights of the victims. Following its adoption by the National Assembly and the approval of the President, the bill will be enacted as a third amendment.Addressing the lower house before passing the bill, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, Nepali Congress president Sher Bahadur Deuba and Maoist Centre chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal expressed their shared views on the bill, claiming it was victim-centric, met international standards and complied with Supreme Court orders. However, except for rape cases and serious sexual violence, intentional or arbitrary killing, enforced disappearances and inhumane or cruel torture, the bill doesn’t meet their claim. The primary concerns lie in categorising crimes, which remain unaddressed. While some groups have welcomed and supported the bill, mainstream victim groups, nevertheless, are advocating to make the process ‘victim-centric’ to attain tangible results. They have continuously pressed the lawmakers to improve the objectionable flaws and seize the opportunity that comes with the amendment. Serious flawsNot recognising “surviving enforced disappeared” people as victims is one of the flaws contradicting the international definition. Engaging child soldiers (verified by UNMIN) in war crimes committed by security forces or armed groups is confined to reparation in the bill. The classified non-pardonable serious human rights violations and pardonable human rights violations are severely problematic. The crimes that fall under serious human rights violations are kept in the ambit of human rights violations, which has caused a strong objection to not complying with the principles established in our so-called nationally driven process.Besides the grave human rights violations, according to the bill, any crimes committed against Nepal’s prevailing law, international human rights, or humanitarian laws are categorised as amnestiable. This means that crimes like torture, kidnapping, amputation and disability with serious torture, including war crimes and crimes against humanity, are subject to amnesty with the free consent of the victims. It also has a provision of a 75-percent reduction in sentencing, amounting to disguised amnesty, which contradicts the principle that criminal sanctions must be proportionate to the gravity of the crime and undermines the fundamental role and competency of the judiciary. Such provisions neither comply with international standards nor follow the Supreme Court orders. Widespread concernsThe bill has drawn international attention, with many diplomatic envoys and development partners taking to social media to comment and congratulate. On X, the UN Resident Coordinator Hanna Singer-Hamdy cautiously commented, “Engaging victims is imperative ... The UN stands ready to support inclusive TJ aligning with international human rights commitment and standards”. US Ambassador Dean R Thompson congratulated but also diplomatically stated, “A meaningful moment in Nepal’s journey to shaping its own peaceful, prosperous, resilient and democratic future”. EU and Swiss ambassadors called it a historic achievement and reiterated their full support for its implementation. These X posts from the development partners are perceived as goodwill gestures for completing the peace process without delay. However, they don’t ignore international obligations and criminal accountability under this pretext. The legitimacy of the whole process lies in adhering to transitional justice (TJ) principles, which are based on truth-seeking, justice, reparation and non-occurrence through institutional reforms. Nepal’s long-time commitments to international human rights and humanitarian laws come into the picture. Addressing the deeply rooted impunity and putting the country back on track with the rule of law towards a functioning and inclusive democracy and sustainable peace is essential. During UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’ official visit to Nepal in October, TJ was recognised as a complex but vital way of securing lasting peace. Addressing Parliament, he said TJ needed to be inclusive and comprehensive and keep victims at heart for it to succeed. In a press meeting, he reiterated, “The United Nations stands ready to support your victim-centric process, and its implementation that meets international standards, and your own Supreme Court’s rulings.”Nepal is committed to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1948 and is a state party to various international human rights instruments, including the Geneva Convention, the Convention on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention against Torture and the Rights of the Child, and other international human rights laws. The authorities cannot ignore these international commitments. Moreover, it has also enacted the National Penal (Code) Act 2017, meeting international obligations enforcing criminal accountability. Embracing TJ’s core valuesEnsuring accountability for serious crimes should not be seen only as victims’ rights but as a legitimate concern for the post-conflict society. This determines the kind of future we are handing over to the next generation. It is time we raised the following questions: Are we building a just society with zero tolerance for impunity and strengthening the rule of law? Does this process that ensures non-repetition and durable peace fall under TJ’s core values? Will it break the culture of deep-rooted political violence? Finally, only seeking political consensus, as in the past, is not a viable solution to this process. The precondition of TJ’s success lies in earning the ‘trust’ of people, especially victims. However, the bill taken as the foundation of the process cannot do so, as the steps taken so far are designed to protect the perpetrators’ interests. In these circumstances, the victim leaders and the civil society involved in ending the process are reluctant to trust the ruling authorities, who have often failed to fulfil their promises.Three global rights organisations, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the International Commission of Jurists, issued a joint statement on Tuesday to ensure the integrity of the process and bring the law in compliance with Nepali and international legal standards. The bill indeed includes positive provisions, but serious accountability gaps must be addressed.  \nThe Constitution of Nepal, as outlined in Article 232, mandates that “relationships between the federation, provinces and local levels be grounded in the principles of cooperation, co-existence and coordination”. Article 235 of the Constitution grants the federal parliament the authority to draft the necessary coordination law to maintain coordination among the federal units. In line with this directive, the “Federation, Province, and Local Level (Coordination and Interrelation) Act, 2020 (2077),” commonly known as the Intergovernmental Relations (IGR) Law, was enacted.The primary purpose of the IGR law is to strengthen the federal system by fostering coordination and cooperation in areas such as law and policy formulation. As Nepal transitioned from a centralised system to a federal structure, laws were critical to facilitate this transition and address people’s aspirations following the new constitution. To bridge this gap and ensure that the newly established three tiers of government function in accordance with the spirit of the constitution, the federal government introduced the IGR law. The law has become one of the most widely discussed pieces of legislation.However, Nepal embraced federalism without fully developing the necessary infrastructure and groundwork for its effective implementation. This decision has led to ongoing challenges, as political parties and their leaders have differing interpretations of federalism from the outset. These differences became apparent soon after the first government was elected in 2017, accompanying the federalism. Despite the constitutional provisions agreed upon by all political parties, implementation has been walking at a snail’s pace, with some provisions still unfulfilled.This has raised concerns, particularly as provincial governments have been demanding their rights from the federal government. Local governments, which had already established their bases and were revived nearly after two decades of dormancy with extensive rights, are now neglected.IGR lawThe implementation of the IGR law has begun, with major provisions gradually coming into effect. However, the process has been hindered by a centralised mindset, sluggish bureaucracy and political meddling.While all federal units have widely accepted the IGR law, the primary concern lies in its effective implementation and the devolution of power. The law’s main objective is to facilitate the implementation of constitutional provisions related to power sharing among the three tiers of government. A detailed analysis reveals that many of the law’s key provisions have only been partially implemented, highlighting the urgent need for a robust mechanism to ensure that all structures envisioned by the law are fully functional.Leaders holding executive positions at the federal level have been reluctant to devolve exclusive powers to the sub-federal levels. This reluctance, driven by a desire to retain power at the federal level, has significantly impeded the proper implementation of constitutional provisions and laws intended to strengthen inter-governmental relations. Additionally, the stakeholders’ lack of ownership has further obstructed the process. For the proper application of the law, all stakeholders must clearly understand its importance.Government officials have often failed to grasp the spirit of the explanatory notes, which outline the principles of coordination, cooperation and co-existence that underpin the IGR. Despite having the necessary legal framework, state organs have not ensured its proper execution. However, the provinces and local levels have shown resilience, refusing to relent, which is a positive aspect.Slow implementationSeveral factors have contributed to the slow implementation of the IGR law. Unstable governments have delayed meetings of Sectoral Thematic Committees, the National Coordination Council (NCC) and the Provincial Coordination Council (PCC), affecting their ability to resolve issues. Frequent changes in government have also disrupted the settings of IGR mechanisms. Additionally, the study of the law has been delayed due to a lack of resources, with employees in the law ministry often juggling dual responsibilities that hinder their work.Local governments are often unaware of many IGR law provisions and lack the resources, technical manpower and skills to implement them fully. The use of non-declarative phrases and sentences, such as “matters to be considered” or “if found necessary,” has weakened the law’s effectiveness.One striking example of such a lack of coordination is the delay of the Kathmandu-Terai fast-track project. It highlights the significant lack of coordination between the three government tiers despite the existence of the IGR law.Addressing coordination issuesA permanent structure at the Office of the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers (OPMCM) is needed to function as the secretariat of the National Coordination Council. This structure should have a strong presence of representatives from sub-federal levels. Currently, the Provincial Coordination Section of the OPMCM handles issues related to the provinces, while the Ministry of Federal Affairs and General Administration manages local-level issues. A single mechanism should be developed to address issues concerning both federal units.Similarly, a mechanism for coordination and consultation at provincial and local levels should be established. Section 4 of the IGR law does not specify which federal body will coordinate with provinces and local levels while formulating laws and policies on exclusive and concurrent power matters. A coordination and consultation mechanism should be developed at the federal level, as the legislature has the sole authority to make laws, and the government prepares the first draft of bills.The Intergovernmental Fiscal Council was established under the Intergovernmental Fiscal Arrangement Act of 2017 to resolve fiscal issues between federal units. Since the council is more inclusive, functional and effective, the representation model used in the Sectoral Thematic Committees should be similar to that outlined in the Fiscal Council law. Having at least one local representative from each province could help raise and resolve their issues.The Provincial Coordination Council should be made more inclusive, with increased representation from local levels. This would ensure that the new mechanism represents all local levels. Compared to the initial one, the existing provision is regressive. A series of information-sharing programmes should also be conducted among federal units to educate them on the IGR law and federalism. The Federalism Implementation Special Committee of the National Assembly has urged the government to launch a broad awareness campaign from the grassroots to the federal level. Targeted training and orientation sessions at all local levels are essential to inform stakeholders about the law’s provisions and implications.Other things include resource management, skilled human resources and logistics management. These would prove beneficial in addressing the coordination issues in our federal structure. \nIn June, when the Cabinet decided to make National Identity Card (NID) mandatory for accessing government services, including social security allowances, it was widely criticised, with even federal lawmakers voicing their disapproval. The Home Ministry had announced that the directive would be enforced in 28 districts, setting a deadline of mid-July. This decision had “terrorised people”, as they feared they would be deprived of social security services, and many registered in haste.But the government last month decided to overturn the directive with equal haste. Now, the Nepalis are left confused: To obtain it or not to obtain it? Seemingly disbelieving the government's changing position on the use of the NID, over half a million people opted for it between mid-June to mid-July. Yet, there is little information about whether the government has worked out the behind-the-scenes procedures for its proper utility. Despite the NID’s design to combine important identity cards and documents including driving licenses, academic documents, voting cards, insurance details, and ATM card numbers in a single chip, implementing agencies still lack the infrastructure for such an endeavour. This technological hurdle adds to the already challenging task of fully executing the NID card campaign six years after the government started distributing it. Moreover, the hubbub surrounding the NID’s “revolutionary” function has proven to be dubious—it is either of no use or is imposed arbitrarily on the people. This is a prime example of how our authorities care not to think about its citizens' comfort or welfare when they come up with new policies or schemes. The authorities' main argument for implementing the NID is that it will be a one-stop solution for surveilling and controlling criminal activities like financial fraud by removing duplication. Article 51 of the Constitution of Nepal 2015 pledges to develop an integrated national identity management information system and manage citizens' data. The NID and Registration Act 2020 states that personal privacy would be ensured in its usage. But experts believe the document has several loopholes as it does not discuss data protection. Sensitive data and information of the citizens are the nation's assets, and they must be safeguarded diligently. However, the government is yet to fully assure citizens about data privacy; what is working in the government’s favour is that many lack digital literacy enough to know about their privacy rights. Moreover, the government has not clearly explained how it plans to segregate information access by multiple agencies, as the NID provides an integrated database of different information. This paints a murky picture of Nepal’s cyber security ecosystem, as data security is fragile, and hackers often target government websites. Ever since the launch of the Adhaar Card in India, there have been numerous cases of duping, misuse and information leak. The government must learn from the mistakes of its next-door neighbour before launching a “grand” campaign to digitalise identification. The government would do well to return to the basics before taking any further steps and clearly address the concerns of experts, lawmakers and citizens about why and how the card is an important addition to other identifications like citizenship, driving license, and passport. Moreover, the authorities should first ideate on the utility, functionality and safety of the NID before imposing it on the citizens.  \nNepal’s biggest fears are coming true: Climate change-induced disasters are here. The recent catastrophic “rare flood” in Thame village in Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Rural Municipality is a case in point. Last week, the swollen Thame River reportedly destroyed 20 houses and an elementary school and displaced 135 residents of the village. Two of the five small glacial lakes formed above the settlement burst, causing a glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF). GLOF occurs when a glacial lake breaches its natural dam called moraine—a pile of debris left behind by a glacier. The Thame incident has again centred people’s attention on mountains and climate change. We cannot help but remember a 2020 report by the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), which warned that 47 glacial lakes in Nepal, China and India are at high risk of bursting, 21 of them from Nepal alone. As alarming is the organisation’s 2023 report, which projects a threefold rise in GLOF risks across the Hindu-Kush Himalayas by the end of this century and peak GLOF dangers expected by 2050. These warnings should be enough for us to be serious about this matter. Such a crisis has been looming over us for a long time now, but our efforts to mitigate climate risks are far from adequate. Nepal has already witnessed 24 GLOFs, yet there aren’t enough disaster preparedness programmes, prevention methods, comprehensive risk mapping and risk assessments in place. The politicians’ priorities, primarily focused on filling their coffers and racing towards premiership, have not only neglected such grave issues but also amplified them. We cannot wait for another disaster to devastate lives and properties before we take action.GLOFs, with the right interventions, are not insurmountable, according to experts. We needn’t look far to understand how human intervention can lessen the risks of glacial lakes. Take Imja Glacial Lake in the Everest Region and Tso Rolpa in Dolakha, for instance. In 2016, the Nepal Army lowered the water level of Imja Lake by building an exit channel for excessive water and, in 2000, the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology lowered the water level in Tso Rolpa by three metres. These interventions were costly but protected thousands of people living in the settlements downward. Such efforts must also be scaled up in other high-risk lakes, and monitoring teams and early warning systems should be administered in such areas. Our authorities should immediately emulate such successful practices to reduce the severity of GLOFs. We have the opportunity to discuss the crisis in the upcoming COP29 and lobby for a significant share of Loss and Damage Funds. The minimal funds the government allocates for climate change-related issues can never cover the severity we face. Developed countries and international organisations are duty bound to help Nepal with adaptation and mitigation strategies, apart from supporting risk assessments of GLOFs. As climate change has harmed us in ways that are both profound and perilous, the general public should also realise their roles in escalating the climate crisis and vow to lessen it by switching to environment-friendly practices. We have no other option but to commit to urgent and joint actions to save the future of our planet. \nChhabilal Dahal aka Pushpa Kamal aka Bishwas aka Prachanda has been a champion of change all his life—starting with his own name(s) to the political system. He loathes historical continuities and strives for ruptures—agragami chhalang, as he so enthusiastically pronounced in his initial days in parliamentary politics post the 2006 political changes. In fact, he chased change even as a young political leader of the Nepal Communist Party (Mashal), having changed several parties and factions before finally replacing his seniors and mentors to lead the party in 1989. But after three-and-a-half decades of being the party chief, he has no fascination for change—at least when it comes to leadership change in his party.As the CPN (Maoist-Centre)—as the party is now called after several name changes over the past decade-and-a-half, struggles to stay relevant in the aftermath of its ouster from the coalition with the CPN-UML, the question of leadership change has become prominent once again. In earlier times, anyone who talked of change in the party's leadership, strategies or ideological standpoints would be forced to leave the party altogether—Mohan Baidya, Baburam Bhattarai and Netra Bikram Chand are in case. Dahal continued to maintain his tight grip over the party even if that meant things falling apart in the party. Prachanda, the fierce one, needed to show he was the boss.This time around, Janardan Sharma is leading the band of those questioning Dahal's relevance as party chair or calling on him to hand over party leadership to younger leaders. As expected, Dahal's hardline supporters are worried that any discussion about changing leadership now, when the party is at its weakest since its resurgence in parliamentary politics in the mid-2000s, damages the party further. But Dahal's interlocutor himself has claimed that his calls for leadership change are aimed at ensuring that Dahal’s \"revolutionary\" contributions to Nepali politics last long. For Dahal to leave a lasting legacy as a changemaker, Sharma argues, he should step aside and make way for the new generation leaders within the party.Sharma isn't wrong in this regard. After all, how long can a party remain relevant under a single leader? Indeed, there must be a saturation point somewhere, and the Maoist Party seems to have gone past that point. From its heyday as the single-largest party, with 220 seats in the 601-strong first Constituent Assembly to a distant third with just 23 seats in the 275-strong Parliament, the Maoist Centre has been on a downward spiral for quite long now. And with coalition change for making and breaking governments seemingly being the only definition of change for the party now, there are obvious misgivings about Dahal's leadership. Moreover, with the recent breakthrough in the Transitional Justice Act, there are new hopes for a fairly acceptable, if not entirely successful, culmination of the peace process. A post-peace Nepal would certainly seek a new dispensation across political parties. Perhaps it is time for the Maoist Centre to realise that Dahal's alternative as party chair will be found only when it starts looking for one. \nCPN (Unified Socialist) leader Ram Kumari Jhakri, involved in the party's formation in 2021, now advocates for a merger with the CPN-UML, attributing the inability of Unified Socialist to perform well to domination by old leaders, lack of clear policy, and unresponsiveness to UML overtures.\nThe Maoist Centre, led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal, has recently been ousted from the government and is now discussing its strategy after reviewing national and international events, including the proposed constitutional amendments by the new ruling coalition, external influences, and the possibility of party unification.\nWater resources expert Ajaya Dixit highlights the rampant encroachment and pollution of rivers in Nepal, particularly in urban areas, due to outdated river management practices and urban development that disregards water bodies.
