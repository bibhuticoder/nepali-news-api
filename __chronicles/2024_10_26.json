Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nThe construction of 120 micro- and medium-level hydropower projects, mostly undertaken by the private sector, has been badly affected after India failed to supply explosives through the Nepal Army.Although this is not a new problem, as several private sector hydropower projects have for years been facing explosives shortages, the crisis has again become severe. The Independent Power Producers’ Association Nepal (IPPAN), an associate of private developers, has started reaching out to ministers to facilitate smooth supply.“We met Foreign Minister Arzu Rana on Wednesday and told her to address our demands immediately,” said Ganesh Karki of IPPAN. “We also met Energy Minister Dipak Khadka and others, and asked them to take our concerns seriously.”According to Karki, of the 183 hydropower projects that are under construction and mostly owned by the private sector, 65 percent of those needing explosives are experiencing delays due to the lack of timely availability.These projects, with a combined installed capacity of 4,000 megawatts, are under construction, while another group of projects of the same capacity have signed power purchase agreements (PPA) with the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) and are in the process of financial closure, said IPPAN in its demands submitted to minister Rana. It added that 80 percent of additional hydropower projects with combined capacity of 20,000 megawatts that are in various stages of development, are led by the private sector and these are also affected by explosives shortage.“Due to the unavailability of explosives on time, several of these hydropower projects are not being completed on time and their construction costs are also increasing. After failing to complete the projects on time, the private sector is forced to pay huge amounts in penalties,” IPPAN said in its memorandum to Minister Rana.“In most cases when we have taken up the matter, officials, leaders and diplomats have cited ‘geopolitical’ reasons behind India’s sluggish approach to supplying explosives,” an IPPAN official said. “Sometimes the Indians blame us for providing explosives to projects not designated for their use.”The process of importing explosives involves the private sector opening a letter of credit (LC) and, as per the LC , the Indian side supplies the explosives to the Nepal Army, which then distributes the explosives to the private sector, as there are concerts that direct supply to the private sector could lead to misuse.Even though the army has for long been producing commercial explosives at its Sunchari Emulsion Plant in Makawanpur district, it does not churn out enough to meet the demands of all the country’s infrastructure projects. The army relies on raw materials imported from India to manufacture these explosives, but it still struggles to keep up with the demand in the market.After Chinese companies and firms started making inroads into Nepal’s energy sector, we noticed Indian uneasiness, which ultimately resulted in two things—not buying Nepali electricity with any Chinese involvement and halting the supply of explosives for projects, a former foreign ministry official said. “Meanwhile, we sometimes tried to import explosives from China, and this may have irked the Indians.”After Indian reservations, Nepali hydropower producers began submitting all details of investors and promoters so that India would stop raising concerns, but this too did not yield positive results, said an IPPAN office bearer. In April last year, some private firms brought in around 90 tons of explosives from China, but that supply did not last, and there were issues with price, time constraints, and other factors.Generally the Indian Embassy in Kathmandu issues a ‘No Objection Certificate’ (NOC) for the supply of explosives for infrastructure projects. Nepal has of late been importing explosives exclusively from India. After explosives became scarce, the government changed the law. According to a new rule, explosives can be borrowed for roads, energy projects and other development projects that require blasting. Projects can borrow explosives only when they face a shortage and cannot get an immediate supply, and when the Nepal Army is also unable to provide them. “If a project doesn’t require explosives immediately and has them in excess, it can provide them to another project,” the new rule says.When a hydropower project faced a similar problem last year, the government tried to import explosives from China, but that proved unfeasible due to very high cost, time consuming import process, and other factors.The current requirement only for hydropower projects is around 5,000 metric tons, with 199 metric tons needed on a monthly basis, said Karki.Nepal Army spokesperson Brigadier General Gaurav Kumar KC admitted that there is a shortage of explosives and production, and the army’s plant in Hetauda is unable to meet the current demand. Most hydropower projects have been facing shortage of explosives since last December. “We can only meet 20-30 percent of the demand and the rest is met by the private sector,” said Brigadier General KC. He also acknowledged that the army itself has been unable to get enough raw materials to produce explosives according to demand.After hearing the concerns of IPPAN officials, Foreign Minister Rana assured them that she would try her best to facilitate the import of explosives required for hydropower projects.IPPAN has also warned that if shortages continue, Nepal’s target of producing 28,500 megawatts in ten years will not be fulfilled, and the country’s goal of exporting 10,000 megawatts of energy to India in next ten years will be affected.In order to encourage foreign investment in energy, IPPAN has urged the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to facilitate the import of explosives, create an environment of exporting 10,000 megawatts of energy to India in next ten years, and coordinate with Nepali missions abroad to attract foreign investment in the energy sector. As per the Working Procedure on Import, Transport, Storage and Use of Explosives-2017, the import, transport, and storage of explosives for industrial and construction projects should be carried out under strict vigilance of the Nepal Army.Imported explosives, mostly from India, are managed by the army, which oversees their distribution, storage and use, said Karki. And during detonations, the army sets up a dedicated camp near the project site to ensure the explosions are carried out safely. \nManorama Sadda and her husband, Umesh, from Siraha’s Betauna, spent years watching their son Pratik struggle with communication and behavioural issues. What began as subtle delays in speech and awkward social interactions eventually translated into academic difficulties.By the time their son was nine, his teachers were growing concerned. Yet, for Manorama and Umesh, the possibility that their child could have a deeper intellectual or emotional challenge never crossed their minds.“We thought he was just a bit slower than other children,” Manorama says. “Everyone around us said boys take time to mature, so we didn’t worry. We had no idea it was something serious.”Their son’s autism was recognised too late, and only after 2020 when his teacher recommended they seek professional help. “We had never heard of such problems, and we didn’t even know where to go,” Umesh says.In Nepal, children’s mental health issues are often neglected due to a lack of awareness, social stigma, and insufficient medical infrastructure.For many parents, by the time they seek help, the damage has been done, with lifelong implications for their children’s development.“Although children and adolescents comprise over 42 percent of Nepal’s population, mental health awareness in this demographic remains woefully inadequate,” says Dr Arun Raj Kunwar, a child psychiatrist at Kanti Children’s Hospital.According to Kunwar, the Child and Adolescent Mental Health (CAMH) Unit at Kanti Children’s Hospital in Kathmandu, established in 2015, remains the only full-time child and adolescent psychiatry outpatient clinic (CAP OPD) in the country.“In the absence of dedicated inpatient units for children, young patients who need hospitalisation are often placed in adult psychiatric wards—an alarming violation of international standards,” says Kunwar.The limited access to mental health services outside major urban centres is stark.Accessing this service was a struggle for parents like Manorama and Umesh. “We spent months going from one hospital to another,” Umesh says. “The facilities for children’s mental health are almost non-existent outside Kathmandu. We ended up taking our son out of school and coming to Kanti Children’s Hospital for treatment.”Specialised mental health services for children in Nepal are sparse, and the few centres that do exist are concentrated in cities like Kathmandu.Experts like Kunwar have witnessed this firsthand. “We are doing what we can, but it’s far from enough,” says Kunwar. He explained that between July and December 2015, the hospital registered around 600 cases. By 2018, this number had surged to over 2,400, and by 2019, it had climbed to 3,000. In 2023, the figure exceeded 6,000.However, Kunwar says that the rise in numbers should not be mistaken for a progress in accessibility and awareness. “At first glance, the increasing figures might suggest improvements in screening, but the reality is that we still struggle to make these services accessible to all,” he says.With 42 percent of Nepal’s population being children and studies showing that every child requires some form of psychological support during their developmental phase, Kunwar says that countless cases across the country remain undiagnosed and untreated.The National Mental Health Survey Nepal-2020 reports that 5.2 percent of adolescents suffer from mental disorders, with neurotic and stress-related conditions being the most prevalent at 2.8 percent. Additionally, 0.6 percent of children and adolescents are affected by depression.However, much like Kunwar, experts believe the actual rate of mental health issues could be higher, estimating that 10 to 15 percent of this population may be dealing with various mental health challenges. They attribute the lower figures in the survey to methodological limits.A lack of trained professionals compounds this shortfall. There are fewer than a dozen child and adolescent psychiatrists in the country.“Even in state-run facilities, only a handful of specialists are available,” adds Kunwar. “For a country with such a large population of children, this is a glaring problem.”One big reason behind the delay in seeking mental health care is the stigma associated with mental health disorders. For many parents, admitting that their child might have a psychological issue is seen as shameful, leading to avoidance or denial.As Dr Kunwar explains, “Even though awareness is spreading slowly, parents often come to us only when the situation becomes severe. This is due to both the lack of awareness and the stigma associated with mental health.”A 2019 study published in the ‘International Journal of Mental Health Systems’ highlights the prevalence of child and adolescent mental health disorders in Nepal, with anxiety disorders, behavioural problems, and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) being the most common. However, much of this research remains limited. “Nepal lacks large-scale, national-level studies that can truly assess the extent of mental health issues among children,” the study notes. With such data missing, the government’s response remains insufficient, leaving many families without the needed resources.Even the mental health of school children has been affected. A study published in the Journal of Lumbini Medical College, which is available on nepjol.info, found that among 902 secondary school students, 5 percent had mental health problems, while 14 percent were likely to develop them.Peer problems, emotional difficulties, and conduct disorders are common, yet teachers and parents remain largely unaware of how to recognise these signs or provide support. Early screening in schools, the study says, could help detect these issues before they become more severe.But, in reality, schools have not been able to do so.For Nepal to properly address the mental health situation of its population, both awareness and infrastructure need immediate attention.Experts warn that prolonged periods of neglect, especially during formative years, could lead to more severe problems later in life.Yet, support remains scarce, especially in rural areas where parents like Manorama and Umesh live. “The government needs to act quickly to expand mental health services beyond Kathmandu,” Kunwar says. “If we don’t intervene now, we risk creating a future generation burdened by untreated mental health issues.”To tackle the rising mental health issues among children and adolescents, the Ministry of Health and Population announced in August 2024 that it would start training health workers to assess mental health conditions in this age group.The plan includes training 150 medical officers, nurses, and paramedics to screen children and adolescents for mental health concerns. Experts like Kunwar hope the government will continue to expand such initiatives, particularly in rural areas, to ensure that even children in remote regions have access to essential mental health services. \nPrices of almost all vegetables have shot up in the past week, burning a hole in many households' budgets amid festivities.Most green vegetables sell above Rs100 per kg; some have even crossed the Rs200 per kg mark.Cauliflower, cowpea, green bean, bitter gourd, bottle gourd, potato, onion, chayote, pointed gourd, tomato, cabbage, eggplant, and okra now cost above Rs100 per kg.Nearly four weeks since the heavy rainfall at the end of September devastated the country, battered crops and severed supply lines, vegetable vendors still blame the price surge on the production and supply disruption.“It is becoming difficult to manage household expenses. The prices are rising and rising,” said Nabina Sunuwar, a homemaker.“How can we afford cauliflower at Rs200 per kg and eggplant at Rs110 per kg?” she asked.“We have a limited income source, and food prices rising every day is worrisome.”Binay Shrestha, information officer at the Kalimati Fruits and Vegetable Market Development Board, said that the seasonal vegetable production, particularly the post-monsoon output, has declined so the market receives only smaller quantities.“We hope the prices will cool down once the winter seasonal vegetables arrive.”He blamed a mismatch between the output and supply for the rising prices.The Kalimati market, the country’s largest vegetable wholesale platform, has been receiving 500 tonnes of vegetables daily for the past few weeks.On Thursday, the market received 507 tonnes of vegetables. Normally, the Kalimati market handles 700-800 tonnes of vegetables daily.However, the demand increases amid short supplies during the festivities, and prices go up, said Shrestha.Of the 500 tonnes of vegetables that arrive at the Kalimati market, 40 percent are potatoes and onions. Green vegetables make up the rest.Traders said that the prices might slowly cool after Tihar and Chhath festivals, with more consignments coming from farms.Consumer rights activists said that leaving the vegetable market unchecked has caused the prices to reach uncontrollably high.Vegetable prices have increased by more than 300 percent within a month, and this is not only because of the low output, said Prem Lal Maharjan, president of the National Consumer Forum. “The government is either unaware of the issue, or it is simply giving traders a free hand.”“It is the government's responsibility to monitor the supply situation and push down prices during the festivals and a crisis.”Changing weather patterns have significantly impacted vegetable production. A record high rainfall in Kathmandu and other parts of the country damaged crops, reduced yield and also affected the supply of vegetables from other districts. This has created a supply crunch, leading to the rise in prices.The inflation in vegetables has increased, central bank’s data show.According to Nepal Rastra Bank, the year-on-year consumer price inflation stood at 3.85 percent in mid-September, compared to 8.19 percent a year ago.However, vegetable inflation increased by 9.84 percent in the review period.The Kalimati Fruits and Vegetable Market Development Board's wholesale vegetable price index shows that the price of most vegetables, such as tomatoes, onions, carrots, cauliflower, and cowpeas, has crossed Rs100 per kg. The wholesale price of tomatoes has crossed Rs125 per kg, while in retail, they sell for Rs200 to Rs210 per kg.On Friday, potato wholesale price was Rs82.67 per kg at Kalimati, but in retail, it traded for Rs130 to Rs135 per kg.The wholesale price of cauliflower has reached Rs130 per kg, a 73.33 percent jump in two months. The vegetables now cost Rs200 to Rs205 per kg.The wholesale price of French beans (rajma) has skyrocketed by 40.74 percent to Rs190 per kg. In retail, it costs Rs270 per kg. \nMany books are said to have the power to heal, but can a book trouble you? I didn’t realise it until I read Kate Elizabeth Russell’s ‘My Dark Vanessa’. This novel has deeply impacted me, breaking my heart. I even allowed it to rob me of peaceful sleep. It is devastatingly beautiful and worth every bit of the sorrow it left behind.Russell weaves themes of love, trauma, denial, grooming, and the long-term effects of abuse. I struggle to express how a story filled with pain and turmoil can be portrayed with such beauty. How does grooming blur the lines between love, control, and abuse? This is one of the novelvs most Intriguing questions. ‘My Dark Vanessa’ begins in 2017, introducing 30-year-old Vanessa Wye as she prepares to work at a hotel in Portland, Maine. The narrative opens with her refreshing her Facebook page. She is anxiously awaiting updates about Jacob Strane, who is her former English teacher and is under investigation for sexual assault by a former student.The story alternates between this timeline and Vanessa’s past, starting in 2000 when she is a 15-year-old scholarship student at a prestigious boarding school, Browick. In the same year, Vanessa’s relationship with her best friend had turned cold, and no one had filled the vacuum. Vanessa isn’t particularly close to her parents either. Her mother urges her to promise that she will make a large group of new friends so she won’t spend all day alone in her room. Vanessa’s mother is determined for her to “get out there” and live a fuller life this year.To cope with her loneliness and become more involved, Vanessa joins the creative writing club, where Jacob Strane is the faculty advisor. After learning that Vanessa has no friends, Jacob asks her personal questions. As their conversation continues, Jacob's behaviour makes Vanessa uneasy. These lines from the book reveal the beginning of something unsettling: “Mr Strane sets the eraser on the chalk rail and contemplates me from across the room. He slips his hands into his pockets and looks me up and down.”“That's a nice dress. I like your style.”A middle-aged teacher commenting on a student’s outfit feels uncomfortable. One day, in the classroom, Vanessa makes a mistake on the computer. Jacob reaches down, places his hand over hers, and guides the mouse. When she makes another mistake, he repeats the action but squeezes her hand this time. What’s disturbing is that Jacob doesn’t behave this way with other students. This marks the beginning of Jacob’s physical closeness to Vanessa.Gradually, Jacob starts asking to read Vanessa’s poems and writings. He praises her work, making her feel special—intoxicating, as she feels isolated and misunderstood at school. Jacob’s behaviour is a mix of charm and manipulation, which lays the groundwork for a grooming process where he preys on her vulnerabilities, convincing her that their bond is unique and meaningful. Over time, Vanessa enjoys his attention, secretly longing to be noticed.One day, while Jacob is still focused on her poem, his knee brushes against Vanessa’s bare thigh beneath her skirt’s hemline. Vanessa freezes. As he continues reading, he tells her she’s a dark romantic like him, someone drawn to dark things. Then, he pats her knee. She remains paralysed, unable to move, while he continues marking her poem, his other hand slowly stroking her knee. At that moment, Vanessa feels disconnected, as though she has changed and become something less than human.Vanessa feels detachment and disorientation as Jacob touches her. She is no longer grounded in her body, drifting away from her sense of self. The unsettling actions make her feel alienated and disconnected from her usual identity as a teenage student. She feels she has transformed into something unfamiliar and distant, leaving her unable to respond or react.Then, as days pass, Vanessa feels desperate for something more to happen between them. Little touches turn into kisses. Russell describes how Vanessa feels a sense of power to make a 42-year-old teacher fall at her feet. With a man 27 years older than her, Vanessa thinks that she has encountered love for the first time. Russell articulates Vanessa as fearless and bold for wanting something that can ruin her being. When Jacob invited her to his house, she readily agreed. Russell describes Vanessa in Jacob’s house, how she feels being there, what they do together, and what Jacob does to Vanessa. Although Vanessa perceives these encounters as consensual or romantic due to Jacob's grooming tactics, they are exploitative. Jacob positions himself as a lover while simultaneously reinforcing his dominance through emotional manipulation—he convinces her that she instigated their relationship and that their bond is special.Later, when Vanessa becomes more mature, a part of her believes that she was mistreated by Jacob, and another part wants those things more. When you are traumatised, when you are exposed to a negative feeling a lot, you start to get accustomed to it. You associate meaning with it. That is what Vanessa did: she associated abuse with love. The adult Vanessa struggles with her past, unable to form genuine connections with others. Now in her thirties, she finds disinterest in relationships with men her age. Instead, she focuses on Jacob, who occupies a central place in her thoughts.Despite the revelations of Strane's predatory behaviour towards other students, Vanessa clings to the belief that their relationship is special and consensual. This attachment is rooted in a complex mix of nostalgia and denial; she perceives Jacob as her first love, complicating her ability to move on. Vanessa often romanticises her past with Jacob, seeing it as a love story rather than confronting the manipulation and abuse she endured. This mindset drives her to fiercely defend him, even as she struggles with the truth of his actions. Her inner turmoil is captured in this powerful monologue:“I just really need it to be a love story. You know? I really, really need it to be that.” “Because if it isn’t a love story, then what is it?” “It’s my life. This has been my whole life.”These lines are loaded with emotional weight, and reading them brought me to tears. Russell captures Vanessa’s internal conflict perfectly—how she mistakes abuse for love and refuses to see herself as a victim.Jacob, unable to face the consequences after being exposed by his former students, is later found dead in a river, with suicide suspected. As Vanessa processes his death, she tries to piece together her life and heal.By the novel’s end, Vanessa adopts a dog and takes it for a walk. With the sun on her face and the dog beside her, Russell writes that Vanessa feels an immense capacity for good. She is finally stepping into a new chapter of her life, free from Jacob’s presence in her mind.I couldn’t have wished for a more fitting conclusion to this haunting yet powerful novel.My Dark Vanessa Author: Kate Elizabeth RussellPublisher: William MorrowYear: 2020Pages: 384 \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli presented his government’s 100-day report on Wednesday. While presenting his accomplishments, Oli committed to take action against cooperatives frauds and to refund the money of depositors.As the prime minister claimed that the government was making progress in terms of creating the environment for returning the savings of cooperatives depositors, the National Campaign for Protection of Cooperative Depositors has announced the fourth phase of protest, accusing the authorities of not implementing the agreements reached with them in the past.Alleging the government’s non-commitment to implementing its earlier promises made with the National Campaign for Protection of Cooperative Depositors, leaders of the campaign on Thursday organised a press meet in Kathmandu on Thursday where they announced to start the fourth phase of protests from November 20.They said they would still wait for the government to implement the agreements until the deadline. The representatives of the victims claimed that the fourth phase of the protest would be a decisive one.“Despite reaching an eight-point agreement one-and-a-half months ago, the government has not cared to address the problem since. Therefore, we planned to resume our protest,” Kusluv KC, chair of the campaign, told the Post.“Minister for land management, cooperatives, and poverty alleviation [Balaram Adhikari]’s claim at a press conference on Wednesday that they addressed our concerns made us furious.”The government had reached an eight-point agreement with the cooperatives victims on September 9. It was the third agreement signed between the government and the depositors who lost their savings within a year.“Not only are cooperatives frauds being prosecuted, but initiatives are also being taken to formulate a cooperatives authority act, and establish a cooperatives credit information centre and debt recovery tribunal that are necessary to refund depositors’ money,\" Prime Minister Oli said, while presenting the government's progress in its 100 days in office on Wednesday.Cooperatives victims resumed their third phase of protests on June 24, accusing the government of failing to implement agreements signed with two ministers in the past.The victims staged the first phase of their agitation in June last year. They reached a seven-point agreement with Ranjita Shrestha, then-minister for land management, cooperatives, and poverty alleviation.As the agreement was not implemented, they launched the second phase of agitation. On March 22 this year, they signed an eight-point agreement with Minister Adhikari.The victims suspended their 108-day protest following the eight-point agreement of September 9 as the government reiterated its promise to return their savings. The eight points were agreed upon after a negotiation between the representatives of the National Campaign for Protection of Cooperative Depositors and government officials in the presence of Arjun Prasad Pokharel, the secretary at the ministry.As per the agreement, a committee was formed with the sub-registrar of the Cooperatives Department as coordinator. Its mandate was to continuously assist in collecting and analysing data to address issues, including the return of depositors’ savings. The committee comprises representatives from the ministry and the national campaign. The campaign chair, Kushluv KC, said Singh KC, a Kuleshwar-based Gautam Shree Cooperative victim, agreed to represent them on the committee. “The committee agreed to monitor the inspection of crisis-ridden cooperatives, collect all the details, and categorise cooperatives,” Kushluv KC told the Post. “The committee was supposed to present its findings and recommendations to the department after analysing the collected data.”But one and a half months after the third-phase agreement, government agencies did not seem positive about holding the meeting as agreed to solve the problem, KC blamed.The committee agreed to conduct financial analysis of the inspected cooperatives, categorise them as well-functioning, crisis-oriented, and crisis-ridden, and recommend necessary actions. It was also agreed that a review meeting would be held at the Ministry of Land Management on the last Sunday of every month to assess the committee’s progress. However, the cooperatives victims say no point of the agreement was implemented.Similarly, the agreement reaffirmed the government's commitment to implementing the previous agreements made with cooperatives victims.“The victims might have thought that the execution of the agreement means immediate receipt of money, which has not happened,” Tola Raj Upadhyaya, deputy registrar and information officer at the Department of Cooperatives, said. “But the government is seriously working to implement the agreement.”In a separate announcement, the government had announced to return the money of small depositors in troubled cooperatives during the budget presentation. It has, however, defaulted on this pledge as well.During the budget presentation for the fiscal year 2024-25 on May 28, the government announced a plan to refund the savings of these small depositors.“To solve the problem in the savings and credit cooperatives, arrangements will be made to return depositers’ money up to Rs500,000 by using the property of cooperatives operators or of their immediate kin as collateral,” then-finance minister Barsha Man Pun said in his budget speech in Parliament.The Post talked to the Ministry of Land Management, Cooperatives and Poverty Alleviation officials shortly after the budget presentation for clarification on how the refund plan would go ahead.At the time, ministry officials had said the government policy, already endorsed by Parliament, would take effect from the start of the new fiscal year. However, five months into the new fiscal year, the government is still busy drafting guidelines to carry out the refund.“Apart from drafting guidelines, we also are waiting for the real data on the cooperatives victims; we are yet to receive the data from the provincial and local governments,” Upadhyaya told the Post. “Once the data is obtained, the money of the victims will be returned by selling the property of the people who misappropriated cooperatives funds.” \nThe gloomy days are upon us again. No sooner had the devastating monsoon rains left Nepali skies than the dry weather started. Those who had gone to their homes to celebrate the biggest festival, Dashain, have returned to cities, as have vehicles, contributing to the rising carbon monoxide levels. Farmers who have finished their seasonal harvest have piled up stubble on their farms to be burned openly. In a matter of days, thick haze and smoke coming from vehicles and farms will blanket the country, including the capital, Kathmandu, which has seen a worsening air quality in recent years. But the problem is by no means limited to Kathmandu.Stubble burning presents a bigger problem than imagined. In Nepal’s Tarai belt, burning harvest residues has become common and has only increased in recent years. A report from 2020, “A model-ready emission inventory for crop residue open burning in the context of Nepal,” shows how farmers’ increasing use of modern agricultural machines like combine harvesters contributes to increasing emissions. These machines save farmers’ time but leave plenty of residue behind. The general public and farmers are yet to internalise how their negligence is contributing to air pollution in the country, endangering lives, including their own. This has affected the vulnerable elderly and children the most; people of other ages are also facing health issues like pneumonia, bronchitis, conjunctivitis, skin allergy, stroke, and heart problems. Every year, particulate matter pollution takes the lives of 40,000 people in Nepal. Yet the public and government continue to pay scant attention to the issue. Smog also drifts to our part of the sky from India, the southern neighbour. Stubble burning is rampant in the country’s breadbasket states of Punjab and Haryana. This year alone, 22 stubble-burning complaints have been made to the police in Haryana, as per Reuters. No matter how hard these states have tried to put a lid on the problem by arresting farmers responsible for poor air, Delhi’s air is already becoming dangerous. Kathmandu’s air quality index will likely deteriorate if instances of stubble burning increase both at home and in India. Already on Wednesday, Chitwan, a city around 170 km southwest of Kathmandu, fared even worse than the national capital, with an AQI of 150.To address this crisis, farmers should be encouraged and sensitised to use climate-smart technologies, including modified combine harvesters and reaper harvesters, and taught about alternative uses of residues, like feeding them to animals, livestock rearing, and making biodegradable waste. Lighting them up should be the last resort. If these methods don’t work, the government can also punish repeat offenders through strict legal action. Cross-border climate diplomacy also needs to be ramped up—this has really become indispensable as climate change respects no borders. With the impending danger of air pollution, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City, in collaboration with other federal stakeholders, has geared up to mitigate the problem this year through smoke metres, which detect vehicle emissions. But this is not enough. Again, the country should be able to control open burning and punish those involved in it. For this, the federal government must come up with a long-term plan. Other local units, particularly those with rampant stubble burning, must also step up to the plate. The problem is air pollution is too serious and too urgent to put off for another day.  \nIn the last week of September, Nepal’s upper Koshi catchment area received the heaviest rainfall ever recorded in the region’s history. The unprecedented rainfall triggered landslides and flooding, resulting in 246 fatalities, over 16,000 families being affected and extensive damages to physical infrastructures, including roads, electricity and water supply systems. While over 50 districts were afflicted, Kavrepalanchowk was hit the hardest.Despite the immediate response from different directions, a detailed factual analysis has not emerged yet. However, previous studies have highlighted the region's increasing environmental challenges and potential for disaster. These underline the significant loss of water sources and rapid land use changes in the Roshi catchment area, where agriculture and pastoral lands have been increasingly converted for stone mining. The debris accumulation from the mining activities along the Roshi River banks posed a serious risk. Eventually, such continuous environmental exploitation resulted in heavy rains that caused severe flooding in the river.Impact on water supplyThe flooding of the Roshi has impacted two big water supply systems supplying water to Dhulikhel, Panauti and Banepa. These projects, which draw water from the upstream tributaries of the Roshi to supply the cities downstream, were completely disrupted after the flood washed away the main pipelines and other physical infrastructures. Although floodwaters have receded and the downstream users in Dhulikhel are attempting to restore the water supply system, they face resistance from upstream communities. The people living upstream, whose water supply system was severely damaged, demand that their local supply system be rebuilt before restoring the downstream supply. This has led to a confrontation between upstream and downstream users over their continuous water sharing. This is not the only example of a disaster which has exposed the vulnerability of Nepal’s water infrastructure. A destructive flood in Melamchi in June 2021 was caused by the sudden landslides that blocked the river after incessant rainfall damaged the Melamchi Water Supply Project. The project supplies water to Kathmandu Valley. It took over a year to restore water from this project, which is closed during the monsoon season. Similarly, the landslide from the 2015 Gorkha earthquake swept away pipelines of the Bidur Water Supply Project, causing the people to rely on a hodgepodge of alternatives until the renovation of the system. Nepal's bigger water supply systems that transport water from distant sources in the mid-hills are highly vulnerable to disaster events. The recurring damage and destruction to the bigger water supply systems from the disasters in the mid-hills of Nepal have raised some critical issues. The region’s hydrological regime has been disrupted repeatedly due to the changing climate, destructive development practices and rapid land use changes. Consequently, several springs that could serve as alternatives to bigger water supply systems are gradually drying up. When an important water supply system is damaged, a considerable investment is wasted, and substantial time and resources are required for reconstruction. Moreover, consumers face higher costs during slow rebuilding, as in our case.In most cities, once the water supply is distributed through a large-scale project, there is a tendency to neglect previously relied upon smaller water sources, such as small springs, traditional wells and stone spouts. Without proper conservation, these local sources dry up over time, further disrupting the hydrological system. These sources could become important alternatives when the bigger water supply systems are disrupted. This is prevalent in the cases from Kathmandu, Bidur and Dhulikhel, as when the major systems in the regions failed, people were forced to travel long distances to fetch water, pay higher costs to tankers and bottling companies and compromise on the basic household needs in the absence of local alternatives. As the cities in the mid-hill region source water from upstream villages, they must continually negotiate with upstream users to secure access to water. The bigger water supply projects can only be built after this contentious issue is settled through negotiations and agreements for cooperation. However, Dhulikhel’s case has shown that when the water supply system is damaged, either by disaster or other causes, these carefully negotiated agreements can be disrupted, reigniting old tensions.Bigger water supply systems offer new potentials but also disrupt old relations and customs around water. These often lead to conflicts and disparities in water access within and beyond the towns. Most emerging Nepali towns invest in bigger water supply projects with loans from international donor organisations. Users are charged higher installation costs and water tariffs to repay the loans. Once regarded as a communal service and human right, it has become a commodity traded on the market. This shift has become detrimental to the urban poor and communal tap users, raising significant concerns about people’s fundamental right to access basic water services. These sort of emerging challenges related to large-scale water supply systems in growing cities have prompted the need to reconsider approaches and explore alternative solutions for making cities more water-resilient.Diversification of water sources is a crucial strategy for cities to achieve water resilience. Several studies have highlighted the importance of small-scale and locally managed schemes. We should not underestimate these initiatives, as they can serve as lifelines during crises, ensuring water access for individuals with limited financial resources. Water managementRegarding water management, cities must prioritise self-organised community-based schemes, often more sustainable than market-oriented bigger water supply systems. The notion of community and mutual sharing in smaller schemes is more effective during the construction of new projects and in rebuilding post-disaster. Hence, different from market-based ‘payment for ecosystem services’ schemes, organically maintained upstream-downstream cooperation for water sharing, often called the reciprocal water shared agreement, could facilitate hydrosolidarity between the users. There is a pressing need for strong regulations to conserve water sources and ensure the sustainability of water infrastructures. Current practices, such as stone mining, road construction and other infrastructure building near water sources and along the pipelines, require serious reassessment. Local governments and community-based water user committees must become vigilant of these issues to promote better practices. The water supply system is a fundamental aspect of urban planning. Sustainable water management should be central to the agenda of upcoming city planning and urban development initiatives. A city-specific collaborative platform with a regular dialogue among experts, municipal leaders, and upstream and downstream water users could aid in exploring solutions for making cities water resilient.  \nTaliban regained control in Afghanistan, leading to the chaotic evacuation of Afghans (including US allies) to the US, where they face legal uncertainty and await Congressional action to determine their permanent status.\nPrime Minister Oli exhibits autocratic tendencies by seeking clarification from critics within his party, despite preaching democracy to the public.\nMcDonald's E. coli outbreak, linked to Quarter Pounder hamburgers and contaminated onions from Taylor Farms, has affected 75 individuals, hospitalizing 22, with one fatality reported.\nWeather forecast predicts partly cloudy to fair conditions in most of Nepal, with isolated rain in hilly regions, and temperatures ranging from 4.3°C to 33°C.\nAmidst street protests by opposition parties, ruling parties firmly reject any attempts to seek political alternatives outside the parliamentary process or new mandate, emphasizing the importance of democratic methods and opposing acts that promote chaos or hinder judicial investigations.\nTraffic police have reintroduced the no-horn campaign in Kathmandu Valley to combat unnecessary honking.Officers carrying placards with “no-horn” messages are stationed at various intersections, urging drivers to refrain from honking.Deputy Superintendent of Police Rabin Karki, spokesperson for the Kathmandu Valley Traffic Police Office, said the campaign aims to curb noise pollution through stricter enforcement and public awareness.Despite Kathmandu being declared a horn-free zone in April 2017, rampant horn use continues. Karki said the Vehicle and Transport Management Act prohibits honking in restricted areas, classifying it as a traffic violation.Last fiscal year, 10,123 vehicles were fined for unnecessary honking. This year, 13,003 vehicles have already faced penalties. The awareness drive was relaunched on October 17.Karki explained that while normal hearing can tolerate up to 60 decibels, 70 decibels is harmful. Noise pollution causes hearing loss, high blood pressure, heart disease, strokes, respiratory issues, and memory loss. Loud motorcycles and vehicles with modified silencers or pressure horns are major contributors. The police are focusing on violators, with particular attention to the impact on pedestrians, especially children, the elderly, pregnant women, and those with health issues, Karki said. \nAmid widespread deaths and devastation caused by monsoon across various districts, Nepal is at a heightened risk for water-borne, vector-borne, and air-borne disease outbreaks.With most water sources contaminated by rain and floodwater, and thousands of displaced people living in makeshift shelters, experts have warned of a potential surge in infections in the coming days.“People are already getting infected with water-borne, vector-borne and air-borne diseases,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “These problems could worsen in the coming days.” At least 209 people have been confirmed dead, while 29 others are still missing due to the floods and landslides triggered by record-breaking torrential rainfall that started Thursday evening. Additionally, 142 people have sustained various degrees of injury, and more than 4,222 others have been taken to safe places, the Home Ministry said on Monday evening. Doctors warn that the risk of water-borne, vector-borne and air-borne disease outbreaks increases in the aftermath of disasters. Nepal’s past experiences suggest the same.“People are already contracting cholera and other water-borne diseases,” said Dr Pun. “As displaced people mostly live in temporary shelters, the chances of spread of air-borne and vector-borne diseases remain high.”At least 95 people from various districts, including from Kathmandu and Lalitpur, have tested positive for cholera since the start of the monsoon in June. The Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool samples of the infected patients. Thousands of others were also infected with diarrheal infections after the start of the monsoon season. Diarrhoeal disease is a common and seasonal public health issue, usually triggered by unsafe food and water or hygiene issues. Likewise, six people died, and 12,644 others were hospitalised this year due to dengue, which has spread to 76 out of 77 districts across the country. Hundreds of people are contracting seasonal flu, but health authorities have no records of these cases.Officials at the Ministry of Health and Population said that they are bracing for tough days ahead, as the floodwaters not only contaminate drinking water sources but also create breeding grounds for various disease-spreading vectors.“We expect a surge in water-borne, vector-borne and air-borne diseases in the coming days, as it takes a few days for these illnesses to incubate,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “We have alerted all agencies concerned to step up vigilance and prepare to deal with any adverse situations.”Public health experts have warned that healthcare facilities in the disaster-hit districts could witness an uptick in cases of viral fever cases and waterborne diseases—diarrhoea, dysentery, food poisoning—and snakebites.Health Ministry officials say that they are aware of the risks and have directed agencies concerned to prepare accordingly.“We have stockpiled essential medicines in districts, provinces and at the central level,” said Dr Roshan Pokhrel, the secretary at the ministry. “Responding to the looming outbreaks is not only the responsibility of the Health Ministry, but also of other ministries and agencies, and we have been coordinating with them as well.”In addition to stepping up surveillance measures, stockpiling medicines, and deploying medics at the health facilities in disaster-hit areas, public health experts emphasise the importance of health awareness in reducing infections.They say a combination of careful surveys, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining hygiene and sanitation, social mobilisation and treatment are required to contain the possible outbreaks of various ailments.The monsoon in Nepal is itself a season of epidemics with thousands of people across the country getting infected with water-borne and vector-borne diseases.The country is one of the world’s most vulnerable to the climate crisis and has witnessed extreme weather events over the past decade and a half.Evidence suggests that the maximum temperature in Nepal is rising at a greater rate (0.056 degrees Celsius per year) than the global average of 0.03 degrees Celsius per year.Experts say extreme weather events—excess rainfall in a short period, continuous rains for several days after the monsoon, dry spells, droughts, below-average precipitation, and above-normal winter temperatures—have become more frequent in Nepal.In recent years, scientists have gathered credible evidence linking the climate crisis to adverse health effects that impact the quality of life and kill people. \nAs the festive season approaches, prices of daily essentials like rice, edible oil, legumes, and lentils have increased.Retailers say food prices are expected to stay high throughout Dashain and Tihar, Nepal’s biggest festivals.In Nepal, food prices are heavily influenced by the Indian market. Even though prices have not increased in India, some opportunist traders have been taking advantage of the poor market monitoring to increase prices under different pretexts. For example, on September 14, India raised the basic import tax on crude and refined edible oils by 20 percent. Nepali importers seized this opportunity to hike their prices even though Nepal had not raised the import tax.Dhurba Prasad Adhikari, joint treasurer of the Nepal Retailers Association, said Nepali wholesalers and retailers have already raised the prices. “It has been a week since edible oil price was increased by Rs20 per litre and the price is expected to increase further as the festive demand kicks in,” he said. But he admits that market rumours and weak inspections make prices more unstable, especially during the festive season when demand is at its peak.According to the association, sunflower oil prices have increased from Rs190 to Rs210 per litre. Likewise, the per litre price of mustard oil has gone up from Rs350 to Rs370.Adhikari, who operates Adhikari Khadya Store, said the price of edible oil is expected to increase in Tihar due to high demand.Retailers said strict inspections in large trading houses could help stabilise prices during the festive season. Consumer rights activists say the current government inspections of the market are just for show and will not address issues related to price, quality, and quantity.“The government’s market inspection body is looking only at retail markets. They, too, know this will not change prices unless they also inspect the warehouses of large importers and traders,” Adhikari said. He said that the government inspecting body needs to check on the stock of goods held by traders.According to retailers, even with the new rice harvesting beginning soon, prices of the staple have increased by Rs100 kg for a 25 kg bag.Even the price of sona mansuli, which normally remains at Rs60 per kg, has now inched up to Rs70 to Rs75 per kg.Rice prices, however, are expected to decline after the arrival of the new harvest.Sugar is now being sold at Rs120 per kg and expected to rise further, retailers said.As private sector traders say they are out of sugar stock and both state supply utilities—the Salt Trading Corporation and the Food Management and Trading Company—have delayed opening the tender to import the sweetener, according to market insiders, the price is expected to cross Rs160 per kg by Tihar.However, retailers said the jeera (cumin seed) price has declined. But the price could still go up in the next two weeks.Last year during Dashain, the price of jeera, an indispensable spice, spiked from Rs1,400 to Rs1,500 per kg. The price has declined, and it is being transacted around Rs950 per kg this year, Adhikari said. Prices of lentils and legumes tend to fluctuate based on international production, but have remained high in recent months.According to the association, pulses have reached Rs180 per kg from Rs175 per kg.Adhikari said food prices have been increasing every year. “The rice prices are so high that people are buying only what they need in smaller quantities,” said Adhikari.“The government needs to intervene in the market, particularly inspect the large traders engaged in unscrupulous market activities,” said Prem Lal Maharjan, president of the National Consumer Forum. “Proper inspection will help bring the prices down. It will also help the government bring in more revenues,” he said.As the government has started operating fair-price shops across the country, there might be some relief for consumers, Maharjan said. “But such subsidised shops should be operated year-round to control market prices.”    \nDean Richard Thompson recently completed his two years as the American ambassador to Nepal. Arriving here just before the 2022 elections, he has since closely observed Nepali politics and society. Umesh Chauhan and Biswas Baral recently sat down with Thompson to reflect on his time in Nepal, major US projects in the country including those under the MCC, geopolitical competition with China, trade, and a range of other issues.How have you seen Nepali politics evolve in the two years you have been in the country? What events stood out? I’ve seen a lot of Nepali politics. Obviously, there’s been a lot of changes. I got here right before the national elections in November 2022. It was really great to see the democratic process play out here, to see Nepalis turn out in such great numbers and make their choices known.Democracy is such a vibrant and colourful exercise anywhere in the world. Nepal did not disappoint on that front. It's been fascinating to watch it evolve, to watch the governments come in different formations.What’s been great is the commitment we’ve seen from successive groups in government to moving forward and carrying forward the [bilateral] partnership and building on projects. I’ve also been amazed at some of the innovative things happening in various sectors of the economy.There has been some very exciting work in the IT sector, for example, that runs the gamut from more traditional back-office type operations to cutting-edge AI research, to developing educational apps for school students, to things like what we have been sponsoring at our Content Creator’s Mela these past two years. It is great to see Nepalis show lots of creativity in expressing themselves and talking about their culture and their society in so many different ways. Across the board, I’d say the experience has been unique.How have the Nepal-US relations evolved over the past 77 years of diplomatic ties? What are the salient features of the relationship? What I would say is we’ve always tried to listen, to engage with the Nepali society. Based on that, I think one of the things that we’ve done is refine the range of products.The Peace Corps, the USAID, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, the Development Finance Corporation, or other elements of our assistance and development commitments—these are different tools that can be employed. And Nepal has continually expanded its capacity to take advantage of them. The US has been able to increase the number of tools and assets, if you will, that Nepal can use to build its economy.I’m very proud of the fact that we have done this primarily through grant-based assistance, so that there is little in terms of downsides. At the same time, we have focused on different segments of the economy or society, for example, through the Development Finance Corporation, we’re now able to target and work with the financial sector to create more opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises, particularly women-run enterprises. Through the USAID, we can use more of the traditional mechanisms of assistance.The Millennium Challenge Corporation kind of speaks for itself. It targets large-scale, massive infrastructure type projects that aim to be transformative in terms of Nepal’s economy. It has helped grow the road and infrastructure network and show new technology that can help expand that network and make roads safer, more reliable, and easier to maintain. It has helped build an electricity infrastructure that allows Nepal, first and foremost, to internally use the green hydropower that's at its disposal, but there will be excess capacity even to export it to the region to earn additional income. So I’m pretty excited about what I’ve seen happen over the past 77 years, and where we are today. I’m also extremely positive about building on where we are now. Can you give us a status of the implementation of projects under the Millennium Challenge Account Nepal? In the MCC, energy, obviously, is a high-priority area and so is transportation. Where we are with the projects themselves is we have let out the contracts for the sub-stations, for the 18-kilometre cross-border transmission line, and we have reissued the tender for the 297-kilometre broader transmission line package that had to be revised due to some cost changes over the time it took to implement that piece of the package.But we’re pretty positive about getting that back on track by the end of the year and putting the project firmly on the right footing for a five-year completion timeline. But there have also been hurdles, right? Do you still expect the transmission lines and road projects to be completed in five years?I expect there to be more hurdles. The biggest challenge was when the bids came back for the 297-kilometre transmission line. We had a number of delays there from Covid to worldwide inflation, to supply chain shifts that I don’t think people had foreseen completely. I’m not surprised. But the MCC has had a lot of experience around the world with these projects.It builds into this assumption that there will be challenges, there will be situations that need to be rethought and overcome. The real trick is making sure we move forward in a way that’s smart and focused on keeping things on time and on track. We're fortunate in the case of Nepal because we have a partner that has so heavily invested its own resources into the project.We have our $500 million grant and Nepal is putting in almost $200 million. It’s been made a national pride project. Look, other things will inevitably come up. But we believe that we have a good team that’s ready to tackle those types of challenges and press forward.At the end of the day, this can serve as a really positive model for how development assistance and how large-scale infrastructure projects can be implemented in a partnership that is largely the result of an internal domestic process. Don’t forget, Nepal requested the MCC project. The government of Nepal, through a consultative process, developed the idea, designed the project, and is now its lead implementer.We’re a financier and a partner but it is very much a Nepal-owned effort. Talking about challenges, there are many local governments and we have to deal with them every 10 to 15 kilometres in the project areas. Different communities have different concerns and priorities. This can add to some difficulty.What do you think will happen to the project if it cannot meet the five-year deadline?The fate of the project is to be completed in its entirety in five years. I can't speak to whether there’s going to be a particular challenge to delay it by six months or seven months or something like that. Right now, in our planning and projection, we hope that we can move it forward within the timeline.If it needs to go beyond that, we’ll work closely with our partner and figure it out. I’m confident that the $500 million that the US government is providing will be spent within the five years and it will lay a firm foundation for the completion of the project.But coming back to your scenario, indeed, you have different communities. A lot of people are affected by this. Now, on the one hand, that's why we encourage and insist on a consultative process, on everything being as transparent as possible so people know exactly what’s going to happen, that they know what the money is being spent on, what the effects will be in terms of how many trees will have to be cut down or what roads will be built where. That’s very important to us: no surprises for the communities that are out there.I think that we will rely on a lot of that effort to help us propel the project forward if things do get challenging on other fronts as well.Like you said, the project does need to be completed by a deadline of five years. Just in case it doesn’t, what happens?Look, it is an ambitious undertaking. There’s no question about it, right? And the Millennium Challenge Corporation is committed to making it happen within that five-year period. The MCA Nepal is committed to making it happen within that five-year period. But they’re also working closely together to make sure that it’s being done in a proper way, in a transparent way, and I’m confident that we will be able to complete what we need to complete. I’m also sure there’s a firm commitment from the government that if there’s a little piece left over here or there, to make sure it goes forward.I don’t worry about the ultimate completion of the project. I’m more focused on how we get it going as quickly as possible, because just the implementation of the project itself should employ close to 10,000 Nepalis, right? I really want communities to start to see the benefit of the project as soon as possible, because that’s where the transformative nature of it comes into play. Part of it is building it. Part of it is implementing it. Part of it is learning from that process. But then having this infrastructure in place, that’s what really changes the dynamic in Nepal and in the economic well-being of the country.Some fear that a failure to complete the project on time could even create rifts in our bilateral ties.I don’t think they should be fearful. We are partners in this, and if there’s any issue, if we're going to work through it together. What we should be doing is focusing entirely on implementing the project to its fullest potential as quickly as possible.Let’s move to geopolitics. What we see in the region is seemingly an exclusivist India-China geopolitical competition. Indians appear reluctant to work with the regimes that work closely with China. It's almost like they are saying, it's either the Chinese or us. How do you see this geopolitical dynamics playing out in Nepal? And where do the Americans fit in this picture?Yeah, it’s a good question in terms of the dynamic that’s in play today and where things are headed. We have of course been watching the India-China relationship and its development over the past few years with some degree of concern. Obviously, there was conflict there some years ago, and I think they’ve been trying to manage that since.And there’s no question that other countries in the region feel that very powerfully. From our standpoint, what we would like to see is the countries of the region—and particularly Nepal because that’s where I’m accredited and that’s where I have some level of knowledge—exercise their sovereignty and to have the space that they need to make decisions about they own future on behalf of their people in a positive way.We don’t believe countries should be asked to choose. We fully expect that Nepal is going to have good relations with India and China. They’re two neighbours. They’re large countries. They’re important countries in the region. It’s critically important for Nepal that it works with and benefits from both India and China.At the same time, we see no reason that should have any effect on our relationship with Nepal, and no reason Nepal should not be fully able to take full advantage of what the US has to offer. We will continue to watch and continue to work closely with Nepal as a partner and to encourage it to exercise its sovereignty and its decision-making in a way that benefits the Nepali people. The US-China relations are also very dicey at the moment. Surely this has some effect on how the US perceives the Chinese role around the world, including in Nepal.We had a recent high-level visit by our National Security Advisor [to China]. We’ve had recent visits by the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Treasury. I think there’s a real effort to try to manage what we all acknowledge is as a competition that’s underway, in a way that’s positive and can maybe move us more towards some type of cooperative element.That channel should continue to be pursued by the US and China, but it’s not reflective of our relationship with Nepal, or our relationship with India. This is about what we can do together [with Nepal]. I’m not going to comment on what other countries may be saying about us, how they may be trying to influence us.I would commit to us remaining as transparent as possible so Nepalis can make their own decisions about what's happening by our relationship.Recently, the Americans were blamed for ousting Sheikh Hasina from Bangladesh. The US is also often accused of meddling in the domestic affairs of other South Asian states, and in other parts of the world for that matter. How do you respond to this accusation?First off, I think you’ve got to take with a grain of salt anything that’s being said by someone who’s been forced to flee their country. The United States simply does not meddle in the internal politics of other countries. We work very hard to be as transparent as we possibly can about our relationships, about what we’re doing, about what we intend.That’s not to say that if we disagree vehemently with a country about a certain policy or a certain issue, we won’t raise it. But this idea that the US would find some benefit in enacting a change in government like that, it simply isn’t part of our repertoire of diplomacy. What we rather look to do is build the strongest relationships that we can.We love to do that primarily through people-to-people relationships and sponsoring as much development opportunity as we possibly can with our partner countries. So, I put no stock in these types of rumours and statements.There is also this sentiment that the Americans and the Indians are increasingly working together on strategic issues, and the same is seen even in South Asia.Certainly, there’s been a huge growth in the strategic partnership between the US and India. I think we want to see that continue to move forward in a positive way. At the same time, there have been disagreements between the US and India on various fronts, just as we have disagreements with many of our partners. And we try to deal with those in a proactive, professional and productive way.But, again, we see our relationship with each individual country through a bilateral lens. So if there are ways that the US and India working together can be beneficial, and another country agrees to such a cooperation, fine. But when it comes to Nepal, we’re going to base our relationship and our efforts first and foremost on our bilateral discussions and our bilateral relationship.Even as we speak, the US and Nepali armies are undertaking joint training in Nepal. How would you characterise the relations between the two armies?Yeah, the PAC ANGEL exercise is going on, focused on disaster relief, humanitarian assistance. The relationship between the two militaries has been strong, it remains strong, and I think it will continue to be strong primarily because we focus it on the areas Nepal wants to focus on—which is building a Nepal army that is capable of responding to disasters, providing humanitarian assistance, and then serving as part of the global peacekeeping network through the United Nations as the largest contributor force of peacekeepers. It’s in our interest to see Nepal continue to professionalise and develop its capacity on those fronts. That’s where our focus is, and that’s where we will continue to make efforts.There has also been a lot of debate in Nepal on the Indo-Pacific Strategy (IPS) and its applicability to South Asia. What is the current state of its application?The Indo-Pacific Strategy is a broad, big strategy by the United States government about how it looks at the entire region. And so it’s about how we create an open, independent, sovereign Indo-Pacific region for the benefit of all the people in the region.What we will continue to do is employ it to build relationships we have with each of the countries in the region. How can we continue to support democratic development? How can we continue to support economic development? Let’s not forget a huge portion, maybe 60 percent of the world’s commerce transits the Indo-Pacific corridor in some way, shape, or form every year.It’s in everyone’s interest for that to remain open and free. And for the countries of the region to be able to act in a sovereign way in their own interests.There is also a sizable section of Nepalis who believe that the IPS was brought with the intent of countering China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), and that Nepal is struggling to find a balance between the two. What is your reading?The USAID, the MCC, the Development Finance Corporation, all of our development programmes have a singular purpose, which is to work with our bilateral partners to grow their economies, to make them more able to meet the needs of their people. That’s the goal. That's how they were designed. And that’s how we will continue to treat them.The BRI is China's initiative. It’s pushing that forward. It’s up to each country to decide how it wants to engage with others. We believe the model of, say, a USAID or an MCC is proving itself to be beneficial to countries, as they are grant-based and economic growth oriented. We’ll continue to push them because we think the data and historical experience we’ve had support them.I think it’s incumbent on us to try to help all of our partners relate to us as equals in any realm that we’re working together. That’s critically important and something we have to acknowledge and something we have to make sure that they’re able to acknowledge.It's about building trust, about showing that our intent is correct, that we have the best interest of our partners in mind, and that we’re applying the same and transparent standards universally.For example, on the MCC, we’ve published everything on the internet. If anybody in Nepal has a question about any aspect of the project, they can go to the website, they can read about the project, they can see the blueprints, they can know exactly what it’s going to involve. That's how I think we build relationships.I think if I came to Nepal and said, hey, I want to do X project because I want to counter this country, I don’t think I would get very good reception. We just don’t look at the world that way. It’s not a healthy approach in the long run.But a bilateral focus that seeks to empower the people of a country—that’s where I think we have the best chance of moving forward. Nepal’s Parliament has finally passed an amendment to the transitional justice law. How does the US see this development? How do you see the transitional justice process progressing?I think this is a really important step in the process. I would say that we remain positive about the way it's going and we are looking to see how we can help. You noted, I’m sure, that we joined a number of other partner countries in issuing a statement of support after the Parliament passed it.We all know bringing a conflict of this scale to conclusion is always going to be a challenge. The TJ legislation has passed, which was a tough hurdle, but implementation will also be difficult.We’re looking forward to figuring out how we can be supportive, and how other partners can be supportive. Some of that may be through bilateral means. Some of it may be through multilateral means.But what I remain encouraged about, in particular, is, we’ve always said this needs to be a Nepali-run process. It has been. That it needs to be victim-centric. I believe that it is. And so we need to make sure the consultative piece of this remains alive as you move to implementation, so that the victims groups, so that the child soldier groups, so that other entities that have been involved continue to have a voice and continue to work together to figure out how to resolve this, to make reparations work, to bring justice in those cases. And so, we are positive.Thousands of Nepali youths are leaving the country every single day in search of better jobs. In this light, do you see the prospect of greater American FDI helping Nepal build a more robust economy that can create enough good jobs?I do. At the beginning of the interview, I talked about some sectors of the economy that are quite exciting right now. I think you’re seeing a lot of interest from the US in the IT sector, the tourism sector, in the health sector, and in the energy sector as it continues to develop.We’re very keen to look for ways to bring more US investment here, whether it’s through equity sort of vehicles, or direct bilateral investments. I think that can also be positive. I think Nepal did a good job in setting up that April Investment Summit. That sent a really positive signal. You’ll recall that we had a representative from the US Chamber of Commerce, Atul Keshap, come out for that. We’ve had a great run of senior US visitors out here over the last year and a half.I think the key right now is for Nepal, through its private sector, through its government, to figure out how to make the environment for investment in Nepal as attractive as it can possibly be. In this interview, we’ve talked about the idea of competition between countries. One place where I will absolutely acknowledge there’s competition is in trying to attract investment.And so Nepal needs to figure out how to make itself as attractive as possible, and how to make it as easy as possible to do business. That helps not only investments that come from other countries, but makes it easier for Nepalis to start businesses, right? It makes it easier for Nepalis to operate and do what they want. And so, in addition to welcoming, say, US companies or British companies or Canadian companies, we would also love to see Nepalis who have gone abroad come back and start to help in building the economy here.We’ve seen how capable and how dynamic they are in building other people’s economies. Let’s do the same here at home.I mentioned that the trade and investment framework talks that we have with Nepal are in their seventh round. I look forward to, in the rest of my tenure here, to continue to build the momentum that will allow investment to take shape and the economy here to thrive. \nHere’s what Prime Minister KP Oli told the parliament on Monday, saying he was giving the address for a “special” reason: “Nepal wants to maintain neighbourly relations as a good neighbour, not a petty, scheming neighbour…Nepal wants a similar behaviour on the part of its neighbours.”He pursued this line of argument, implying that India is wishing ill on Nepal, imposing on Nepal’s sovereignty and interfering in its independent status and policy. He then told the parliament that he would present the issue at the United Nations General Assembly.It basically amounts to saying he will complain to the UN about India’s behaviour. What a petty idea.Given his inherent character trait, PM Oli will find it difficult to develop trusted relations with India in the short term. His only option is to be diplomatic, predictable and consistent. So far, he’s not been able to do that. It does not bode well for Nepal’s foreign policy, which is the most important means of pursuing Nepal’s current priorities, including jobs, growth and climate change.Calculated relations Oli’s statement in the parliament indicates at least three things. First, his expectations from India have not been fulfilled. Second, his communications with the country have broken down. And third, he thinks India may be working to undermine his political authority.Let’s look at his expectations from the southern neighbour. Oli wants to hold high-level talks with PM Modi of India and build trusted relations.In the past two weeks, media reports and opinion pieces have discussed whether Oli would be invited to India or not. It has almost become customary in Nepal for a new prime minister to visit India first before embarking on other high-level visits. Such a custom indicates the value politicians accord to India, especially if they want their government to be stable.The second indication is that Oli is finding it difficult to communicate with people who matter in India. When you begin to communicate your feelings about India through the media, it indicates that your direct communications have either broken down or are ineffective.Behind Oli’s statement is an obvious intention to play the blame game or rally the public. India may be at fault for many things, but blaming India does not absolve him of inconsistencies on his part or the sheer inability to conduct diplomacy in a dignified manner.The third indication is even more significant. Oli has consistently promoted anti-Indian nationalism, and India finds it difficult to trust him. But would that alone be enough to undermine his government?Throughout history, India has had a significant influence on Nepal’s political process and decision-making. Through its influence on individuals who’ve received gifts, benefits, and resources, some at the highest levels, India holds significant leverage over political decision-making and, by extension, over policies and processes.An old playbookIndia’s calculated relations with the Nepali state came to the fore in August this year when Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba visited India. New Delhi turned her visit into a high-profile affair even though she was unprepared to represent Nepal’s interests. Her visit, rather than building political trust, ended up creating more mistrust between Oli and New Delhi as well as between the Foreign Ministry and the Prime Minister’s Office.Although it is a matter of speculation, there are strong grounds to argue that such a courtesy would not have been extended to someone from the CPN (UML). It generates the question, at least in the public’s mind, whether India accorded special treatment to FM Rana as a “special” individual who happened to be the foreign minister and not as a representative of Nepal.Whether real or not, the perception that India is unhappy with Oli has fuelled the notion that the current government coalition is unstable.Throughout Nepal’s modern history, whenever top leaders are forced out, they tend to seek India’s support to regain power. I have heard firsthand from top political leaders that India used to put a pre-condition: First, demonstrate that you have people's support, then we will use our leverage to help you. Thus, the political leaders would launch a political campaign and hold mass meetings throughout the country. If the broader political environment favoured a political change, then India made the additional push.Now, as Pushpa Kamal Dahal tours the country, blaming a corrupt network of power brokers, we are reminded of this old playbook. During mass meetings, an embittered Dahal frequently alleges that “middlemen, brokers, and big cronies have gotten together, and with the strength of so-called numbers, have tried to strangle truth, justice…and good governance.” He also tells the public that his government was ousted because the investigations on corruption were leading to Budhanilkantha (Deuba’s residence) and Balkot (Oli’s residence).Oli’s inherent anti-Indian streakFor Oli, an inherent anti-Indian streak in his psychological make-up and an affinity with the Communist Party of China makes rapprochement with India difficult.In the last 10 years, Oli has made countless petty statements intended to rile and irritate India. He has also accorded China greater space in Nepal.In his book, former deputy PM Kamal Thapa expresses distaste at the way Oli made an unscheduled visit to China Gezhouba Group Corporation and disappeared for one and a half hours for a private meeting with Chinese Communist Party officials during his visit to China in 2016.Another issue is the Eminent Persons’ Group report, which Oli raised during the launch of Thapa’s book. “It would be good to receive the report,” he said during the programme. He made more anti-Indian remarks at another similar event.At present, any talk of the EPG report is viewed as an irritant by India, because it has consistently sent a clear diplomatic message that the report is dead. The unwillingness of a section of the Nepali populace to accept the message, including the CPN-UML, has not gone well in India.In a recent discussion programme, a former ambassador of India to Nepal indicated that the EPG report had become a new irritant in Nepal-India relations. He said that instead of insisting on the acceptance of the report, Nepal could pursue the individual issues identified. Trends in the last two decades indicate that instead of really trying to address the outstanding issues in Nepal-India relations, Nepali leaders are just interested in politicising them and gaining personal mileage.Nepal’s relationship with India has become more and more of a paradox. Nepal’s dominant ethno-nationalism is anti-Indian. Indeed, Nepal has many unresolved issues with India, but it’s economic development hinges on closer connectivity with India, which in turn hinges on trusted political relationships and ability to untangle complex issues.Snubbed by India, Oli is now headed to the US, where he could still get to meet a lukewarm Modi. He hopes to gain stature and make an impression at several forums including the UNGA, where he is scheduled to deliver speeches. We can only wish our PM well. \nFive years ago, on September 30, 2019, when KP Sharma Oli was prime minister for the second time, the government declared the entire country open-defecation free amid much fanfare. However, years later, thousands of people from across the country are getting infected with diarrheal diseases, including scores from cholera.Rautahat is among the nine districts reporting cholera outbreaks this year. Ward 4 of Rajpur Municipality has reported over 100 cases of diarrheal infection and hospitalisation. However, the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division said only 12 people from the municipality had so far contracted cholera.“Over 100 diarrheal patients from the municipality’s ward 4 have been hospitalised,” Khusid Ahmad, a health worker at the municipality, told the Post over the phone from Rautahat. “Contaminated drinking water could be the culprit for the cholera outbreak there. Samples of drinking water collected from affected areas have been sent for lab tests.”Apart from Rautahat, eight other districts—Lalitpur, Kathmandu, Kailali, Pyuthan, Makawanpur, Rolpa, Sindhupalchok, and Achham—have also reported cholera outbreaks this year. So far, the number of diarrheal patients who have contracted cholera is 95. Interestingly, most of the districts that have witnessed outbreaks of deadly cholera this year had years ago been declared open defecation-free.The Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool samples of the infected patients. Doctors say that detected cases of cholera infection could be just the tip of the iceberg, as most positive cases are being reported from the districts with active surveillance.Public health experts say outbreaks of cholera in multiple districts, even five years after the country was declared open defecation-free, show a huge gap between official declarations and progress on the ground.They say outbreaks of diarrheal diseases, including cholera, are directly linked to drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene conditions, and the country was declared open defecation-free without improving water and sanitation conditions.“Without ensuring the quality of drinking water and sanitation, among other things, authorities rushed to declare the entire country free from open defecation,” said Dr Mingmar Gyelgen Sherpa, former director general at the Department of Health Services. “Instead of improving basic water and sanitation infrastructure, we’ve focussed too much on outbreak management, and this is the wrong approach.”Even though toilets have been built in most households, open defecation is still widespread in many places. Drinking water samples collected from various parts of the country, including from the districts of the Kathmandu Valley, have been found contaminated with faecal coliform, which means the water the public uses for drinking is unsafe. The presence of faecal coliform, a microscopic organism that thrives in the intestines of warm-blooded animals or their faeces, indicates sewage contamination in the drinking water, according to doctors.A previous study had shown that 81 percent of water samples collected in the Kathmandu Valley were contaminated with deadly microbes.“We only focussed on expanding coverage of drinking water but did not pay attention to ensuring its safety,” said Dr Meghnath Dhimal, chief researcher at the Nepal Health Research Council. “Authorities concerned must also focus on improving the quality.”Experts say improving public hygiene is essential to ensuring water quality and avoiding diarrheal ailments. Awareness drives and health education play a crucial role in changing behaviours, which requires years of investment and continuous efforts.Along with investment in health education, attention should go to building climate-resilient infrastructures for drinking water and sanitation, as water resources have been contaminated by floodwaters in many districts. The effects of climate change have increased adverse events, including floods, which in turn have contaminated the source of drinking water, making people vulnerable to infection with diarrheal ailments.“Multiple agencies of the three tiers of government and non-governmental sectors have to make more effort to prevent diarrhoea outbreaks,” said Sherpa. “But there seems to be a lack of coordination among government agencies.” The World Health Organisation also stresses on a multifaceted approach as a key to controlling cholera and reducing deaths. \n\n\nRae was the envoy to Kathmandu during the promulgation of the 2015 constitution and the subsequent blockade. In this conversation, Rae talks about the evolution of Nepal-India ties since the blockade, regional geopolitics, what the two countries get wrong about each other, how New Delhi views Nepali communist parties and the governments they lead, and the change (if any) in India’s neighbourhood policy since the start of Narendra Modi’s third term in office. \nKunwar has been the MD for just under three years. Before coming back to her homeland to join Daraz Nepal, she worked at different American companies, including Amazon, the world’s biggest e-commerce platform. In this conversation, Kunwar talks about the opportunities and challenges of running an e-commerce enterprise in Nepal, as well as the country’s overall business environment.  \nPolice have arrested Ram Bahadur Khanal, a partner of Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai, in connection with the Pokhara-based Suryadarshan Savings and Credit Cooperatives fraud case.Rai is the main accused in various cooperative fraud cases in which millions of rupees from different cooperatives were channelled to the now-defunct Gorkha Media Network. He is currently on the run.Khanal, 48, of Tanahun, who is also a shareholder in Gorkha Group of Companies Limited, was arrested by a police team from the Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) on Friday in Panipokhari, Kathmandu. He owns Nature Herbs International.According to Superintendent of Police Hobindra Bogati, spokesperson for CBI, Khanal was arrested in the same case in which former deputy prime minister and home minister Rabi Lamichhane is being investigated. Khanal has been sent to the District Police Office, Kaski, for further action. \nThe Kaski District Police Office, which is investigating Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) Chairman Rabi Lamichhane, former deputy inspector general (DIG) of Nepal Police Chhabilal Joshi, and Lila Pachhai for cooperative fraud, has now secured court’s permission to investigate them on money laundering charges as well.The Kaski District Court on Thursday granted permission to keep Lamichhane, who is also a former deputy prime minister and home minister, as well as Joshi in custody for seven more days to investigate charges of cooperative fraud, organised crime and money laundering charges. The law allows a custody of up to 90 days for investigation into money laundering charges.Earlier, on October 18, the Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) of Nepal Police apprehended Lamichhane from Kathmandu after the Kaski District Court issued an arrest warrant against him.Judge Chandrakanta Paudel’s bench on Thursday authorised extension of their detention, including that of Pachhai, who was arrested in connection with the same case. The District Police Office and Office of the District’s Attorney submitted separate reports to the court on Thursday seeking a 25-day custody remand for the investigation into cooperative fraud, organised crime and money laundering charges.Deputy Superintendent of Police Basanta Kumar Sharma, who is also the spokesperson of the District Police Office in Kaski, said that police would investigate Lamichhane, Joshi and Pachhai on money laundering charges. “Investigation on three different charges will be carried out against them,” said Sharma.On Thursday, district attorney Kamala Kafle, along with assistant district attorneys Shantidevi Sharma and Bipinraj Tiwari, argued that an additional 25-day custody period was necessary to complete the investigation. Lawyers Yubaraj Parajuli and Bed Bahadur Bista supported this request, stating that crucial documents from various government offices, institutions, and banks were yet to be obtained, and further interrogation remains pending.Senior advocates Narayan Ghimire and Hari Prasad Subedi, representing Lamichhane, advocated against the extension of the detention, as did lawmaker and advocate Sobita Gautam, and other advocates Narayan Kandel, Padmaraj Sharma, and Madhukumar Chaulagain. Advocate Jagannath Dhakal defended Joshi during the hearing.During the court session, Lamichhane, initially agitated, claimed that he had repeatedly been subjected to examinations and that the charges against him were politically motivated. The judge urged him to be calm and express his views. Lamichhane later regained his composure and expressed faith in the judicial process.Police arrested him on the recommendations of the parliamentary special probe committee formed in May to investigate crisis-ridden cooperatives. The probe committee had concluded that Lamichhane was involved in misusing millions of rupees funnelled into Gorkha Media Network from various cooperatives when he was the managing director of the now defunct media company that ran Galaxy 4K Television. This happened before he joined politics in June 2022.After receiving the report, Speaker Devraj Ghimire of the House of Representatives a month ago directed the government to implement the report’s recommendations and a Cabinet meeting instructed the state agencies concerned to take necessary action as per the probe committee’s recommendations.Meanwhile, RSP leaders and activists intensified their protest after the court extended Lamichhane’s custody remand for seven more days. The protesters defied prohibitory orders imposed by the Kaski administration.The protesters and security personnel clashed after the former entered the prohibited area. The RSP supporters who staged demonstrations at Wai Chowk entered the prohibitory area and marched towards Sahid Chowk through Rastrabank Chowk.The demonstrators chanted slogans against the KP Sharma Oli-led government accusing it of taking political revenge against the RSP Chairman Lamichhane. They claimed that the government misused state powers to frame Lamichhane on false charges.Rupandehi Court also permits detaining Lamichhane, Joshi on organised crime chargesRupandehi District Court on Thursday granted permission to detain Lamichhane, GB Rai and Joshi for investigation on cooperative fraud and organised crime charges. The court also granted permission to police to arrest nine others who were allegedly involved in embezzling funds of Butwal-based Supreme Saving and Credit Cooperative.The single bench of judge Shyam Prasad Shrestha issued the permission to arrest them. Lamichhane and Joshi are in police custody in Kaski while Rai is on the run. Joshi was brought to Rupandehi a few days ago, where they spent 13 hours recording his statement before he was sent back to Kaski.According to a police source, preparations are on to bring Lamichhane to Rupandehi on Friday for testimony.A total of Rs780 million deposited in Supreme Saving and Credit Cooperative by 10,391 depositors was embezzled, according to reports. An investigation revealed that Rs142.9 million from Supreme’ funds was transferred to the Gorkha Media Network's bank account. Police earlier filed a case against 28 people including Rai, Joshi and Om Prakash Gurung. The Rupandehi District Court sent Gurung, the chairman of the Butwal-based Supreme Saving and Credit Co-operative, to jail for judicial custody on charges of misusing cooperative funds.Gurung, who has been accused of embezzling Rs1.078 billion of savings deposited by over 10,000 members at the Rai-led cooperative, was sent to jail by judge Shriprakash Upreti. However, the court released six others, including Dipesh Pun, the son of former Vice President Nanda Bahadur Pun, who were also accused of embezzling cooperatives cash. \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli has warned his opponents against ‘daydreaming’ of toppling the government.Presenting the achievements of the government’s 100 days in office, the prime minister on Wednesday said that any attempts to break up the coalition of the two largest parties—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—from power would be futile.Opposition parties, however, claim that the Oli government has been a total failure and is only focussed on protecting the corrupt.“Some are spreading rumours that the government could collapse anytime—today or tonight or by next morning,” said Oli. “These rumours are aimed at undermining the government’s functioning.”The prime minister also claimed that the government has good rapport with the bureaucracy. He also asserted that the economy is showing signs of improvement and that the government is not going to compromise on issues like national interest, good governance and development. “The economy was in chaos when we joined the government. Today there are signs of improvement. Confidence in the private sector has increased, and as per their demand, the government has formed the Economic Reform Commission,” he said.Earlier this month, the government announced a five-member high-level commission led by former finance secretary Rameshore Khanal to recommend reforms to revitalise the economy.Meanwhile, leaders from opposition parties have drawn the attention of President Ramchandra Paudel towards the ‘wrongdoings’ of the government.A group of leaders including CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who is also the leader of the main opposition in the House of Representatives, on Wednesday met the President. Their meeting came two days after they submitted a 13-point memorandum to Prime Minister Oli warning him against, among other things, revising the Political Party Act, allegedly to facilitate party splits, through an ordinance.The leaders urged the President to play a role of guardian and the custodian of the constitution while stating that the government was scheming against the constitution and pluralism, said Kiran Pokharal, press adviser to the President.The President assured them that he was committed to fulfilling his constitutional duties and would work for national unity, Pokharel said. However, an opposition leader who participated in the meeting told the Post that the President explained to them about the limitations of a constitutional head of state. “You know well about the limitations of my office. If the government forwards any such ordinance, I will consult you all on the matter,” the leader quoted the President as saying.Leaders from the Rastriya Swatantra Party, Rastriya Prajatantra Party, CPN (Unified Socialist) and Aam Janata Party accompanied Dahal during the visit.The opposition parties have accused Prime Minister Oli of preparing to ease the split of other political parties by amending the Political Party Act-2017 through an ordinance. Oli, however, has denied the claims.Opposition leaders, meanwhile, took aim at the government, accusing it of spending its first 100 days protecting corrupt individuals.“The government has completed 100 days, and it has proven exactly what we feared when it was formed,” said Maoist Centre Chairman Dahal while receiving a memorandum from the Nepal Intellectual Organisation, which is affiliated to the Maoist Centre, on Wednesday.“Ruling party members, civil society groups and even some people within the government have voiced dissatisfaction with the government’s performance,” Dahal said.Other opposition party leaders have also expressed similar frustrations at ‘the poor performance of the government’.In his address to the nation on Wednesday, the prime minister said that the government was committed to reining in corruption from any time.“The government has begun action against cooperatives fraud. Over 600 people have already been prosecuted and as many as 575 are in jail,” he said.But Oli avoided mentioning the arrest of Rabi Lamichhane, the president of the Rastriya Swatantra Party who is currently in police custody on charges of misusing funds from credit cooperatives in Kaski, Rupandehi, and Chitwan districts.“Besides taking legal action, we are also trying to set up a cooperative authority in order to ensure that depositors get their money back, as well as a cooperative credit information centre, and credit tribunal to provide justice to the victims of cooperatives fraud,” said the prime minister.He went on to claim that 70 percent of the government’s planned tasks have already been completed within the first 100 days. He took office on July 15. Just three weeks ago, over 391 people were killed in floods and landslides across the country. Two days of continuous rainfall across the country caused extensive damage to both private and public property, including roads, highways, and several infrastructure projects.The 391 bereaved families have received Rs200,000 each in compensation, and an additional Rs40.5 million has been distributed to another 2,555 families affected by the disaster, the prime minister said. The government has allocated Rs430 million to flood-affected 71 local units around the country, he said.He also claimed that the government was working “on a war footing” to rebuild the damaged infrastructure, including bridges and highways, and disbursed millions of rupees in various districts to carry out the reconstruction work, repairing the bridges and highways, among others. The prime minister also stated that the government has left no stone unturned to compensate the victims of last November’s earthquake in Jajarkot, West Rukum, Bajhang, Bajura and Doti districts.Speaking about other sectors, the prime minister said that over three million farmers in 35 districts had not received payments for their milk supplies, but his government has provided half of the farmers their outstanding payments in the 100 days. He also said the government has released the dues to 75,000 sugarcane farmers.Highlighting the achievements of his government, the prime minister claimed that his government has secured chemical fertilisers for the upcoming winter, released Rs800 million for agriculture insurance, and paid Rs6.75 billion dues to contractors. It also provided startup funds to 165 youths for innovative ventures. Likewise, the government has received Rs34 billion in commitment for setting up various industrial units, the share market has rebounded, and Nepal’s sovereign credit ratings evaluation is in its final stage, the prime minister added. Earlier in the morning, the ruling parties held a meeting to evaluate the performance of the government and discuss contemporary issues. At the meeting, the ruling coalition emphasised the need for an impartial investigation into the cooperatives scam.The prime minister’s secretariat said the coalition parties have agreed to issue separate statements calling for fair judicial proceedings and adherence to democratic norms. RSP chair and former home minister Rabi Lamichhane was arrested by a Central Investigation Bureau team from his party office in Kathmandu on Friday and subsequently taken to Pokhara for trial for cooperatives fraud and organised crime.A complaint has been registered at the Kaski District Police Office accusing Lamichhane of misusing millions of rupees from a Pokhara-based cooperative. RSP leaders, activists, and supporters have staged demonstrations in Pokhara and other places for the past few days, demanding the release of its chairman, Lamichhane. Lamichhane and several others are accused of misappropriating funds from the Pokhara-based Suryadarshan Savings and Credit Cooperative. His arrest followed a parliamentary probe that linked him and others to the embezzlement of millions of rupees from the cooperative. The probe panel submitted its report a month ago and the government had immediately decided to implement its findings.  \nIn the past few days, there has been a lot of speculation about an ordinance on the Political Parties Act-2017.Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, who is also the chair of the CPN-UML, has been trying to convince leaders from his own party as well as the chief of the major coalition partner Nepali Congress, Sher Bahadur Deuba, of the need to bring the ordinance. But other leaders, mainly from opposition parties, have strongly objected to the government’s alleged plans to introduce it. They have publicly criticised the government for what they called plans to ease the criteria for splitting parties in order to help dissident groups in various political parties. These groups have been waiting for an opportune time to form new outfits or defect to bigger ones.As Oli seems determined to bring the ordinance, Congress leaders are either divided or indecisive, according to multiple leaders the Post spoke with.The issue was extensively discussed during the opposition parties’ meeting convened by CPN (Maoist Centre) on Friday. Almost all the leaders in attendance proposed to strongly oppose the government plan. However, Oli looks determined to press ahead with a revision of the Act. He also briefed his party’s top leaders on the issue during a meeting of the party’s central secretariat on Sunday. After Prime Minister Oli also talked about the plan to soon introduce the ordinance, CPN (Unified Socialist) chair Madhav Kumar Nepal warned of consequences on Monday. Addressing a Lumbini Province-level meeting of the Unified Socialist in Kapilvastu on Monday, party chair Nepal warned Prime Minister Oli against bringing such an ordinance. Nepal said Oli will face backlash if he tried to split other parties. “The government will have to face the consequences. Be careful; those who think they can finish others will ultimately finish themselves. World history shows this. Hitler, who dreamed of conquering the world, was alone when he died. Therefore, abandon the Hitler style,” Nepal said while addressing the meeting.“During the brief meeting of the party secretariat, Oli had discussed the ordinances related to political parties,” a UML leader confided to the Post. However, the party's vice chair, Yubraj Gyawali, denied this. The secretariat meeting was focused on the party's internal matters, Gyawali said.“If there were any discussions about the ordinance with the leader of the main coalition partner, we are unaware of it,” Gyawali told the Post. “But during the party’s secretariat meeting, there was no discussion on it.” Soon after the party’s secretariat meeting, Oli met Sher Bahadur Deuba, the president of the Nepali Congress, the senior coalition partner, on Sunday evening. The two leaders also reportedly discussed the ordinance. Congress spokesperson Prakash Saran Mahat also said that the ordinance issue might have come up during the meeting between the two leaders. “However, the Congress is not ready for it,” he said. “If the ordinance related to the political parties is to be brought, it should be done with consensus among the major parties,” Mahat told the Post. “The chances of bringing an ordinance without a broad consensus are low.”Some provisions of the Political Parties Act-2017 that were nullified through an ordinance three years ago have not been revived or replaced, thereby creating a legal void over registering a new outfit by splitting a party.The Act has a provision that defines criteria under which dissidents of a political party can split the organisation and form a new outfit if they can prove the support of a certain number of central committee members and lawmakers of the mother party.Before the introduction of the ordinance in 2021, the Act had a provision that made it mandatory for a dissident group to show support of 40 percent of central committee members and 40 percent of lawmakers from the mother party to split to form a new one.But the Congress-Maoist Centre government led by Deuba issued an ordinance easing the process to split a party. The ordinance said a dissident group having support of 20 percent of central committee members or 20 percent of the party’s lawmakers could quit the mother party and register a new one.The then UML leader Madhav Kumar Nepal split the mother party and formed the CPN (Unified Socialist) based on the same provision of the ordinance. Also, a group led by Mahantha Thakur of Janata Samajbadi Party followed suit.Three years after the party’s formation, a group of leaders from the Unified Socialist are said to be waiting for an opportune time to return to the mother party, the UML. The party’s former secretary Ram Kumari Jhakri, lawmakers Krishna Kumar Shrestha, among others, are reportedly in favour of rejoining the UML, the second-largest party in the House of Representatives. The Nepal-led party has 10 seats in the lower house.Some leaders from the party accused Oli of trying to split their party by helping dissident groups to split the organisation through ordinance. The Unified Socialist has witnessed a serious factional feud following the election of office bearers and politburo members in August. Although the party concluded its general convention on July 5, the election of office bearers and politburo members was conducted later, only to create new rifts. “To cash in on our internal problems, some forces want to split our party.\" Unified Socialist spokesperson Jagannath Khatiwada told the Post. “For that, the government may bring an ordinance related to the political parties.” There are also rumours in the political circles that the UML leadership might also be working to merge into the UML the group of seven lawmakers of the Janata Samajbadi Party, led by Ashok Rai, which was formed in May after splitting with the Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal. This will make the UML the largest party in the House of Representatives. The Election Commission gave the Rai-led splinter group recognition as a new party, but the decision has been challenged in the court and the case is sub judice. And the party has been unable to expand its organisation due to the legal question about its recognition. Currently, the Congress is the largest party in the House with 88 seats, while the UML has 78 lawmakers (excluding the Speaker). If the dissidents from the Unified Socialist and Rai-led group join the UML, it may become the largest party surpassing the Congress. “How can Congress allow the government to bring the ordinance to make UML the biggest party in Parliament?” Mahat, the Congress spokesperson, questioned. “There are indeed discussions on the ordinance, but it is not necessarily that these discussions yield concrete results.” The Political Party (Second Amendment) Bill was sent to the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee in February. After discussion in the committee, the bill was forwarded to the House for the endorsement. However, the then deputy prime minister and home minister Rabi Lamichhane withdrew the bill from the House, said the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee chair, Ram Hari Khatiwada.Khatiwada, a Congress lawmaker, also thinks the ordinance is unlikely to be introduced. Khatiwada said Prime Minister Oli might have discussed ordinance-related issues with Congress President Deuba, and the UML might have also held internal discussions at its secretariat meeting on Sunday. “But it is unimaginable to think a coalition formed for political stability will create chaos by introducing the ordinance and splitting political parties,” Khatiwada told the Post. “Further, if the ordinance is brought, it should be tabled by the Minister of Law, and I don’t think the minister wants to do so.” Minister for Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs, Ajay Chaurasiya, also denied the possibility of bringing such an ordinance. “If the ordinance is to be introduced, the ministry I am leading should take the agenda to the Cabinet,” Chaurasiya told the Post. “No one till date has suggested that such an ordinance be brought.” The regular Cabinet meeting on Monday was expected to discuss the ordinance related to the political parties. However, the meeting was cancelled at the last minute.Meanwhile, leaders of five opposition parties, while submitting a memorandum to the prime minister on Monday evening, have warned Oli “not to issue any ordinance with a plan to split other parties” with the goal of “imposing a totalitarian two-party system”.Maoist Centre chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, Unified Socialist chair Nepal, Rastriya Prajatantra Party chair Rajendra Lingden, vice-chair Dol Prasad Aryal of Rastriya Swatantra Party, and Aam Janata Party chief Prabhu Sah submitted the 13-point memorandum. The prime minister had tried to allay their concerns by assuring them that he had no plans to introduce such an ordinance, according to Lingden. \nAs the Kathmandu Valley’s air quality is set to deteriorate in the coming days, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City is gearing up to start vehicle emission testing.For this, the city office has purchased a smoke meter (a portable device for testing vehicle emissions), which will be used in coordination with other stakeholders—the Metropolitan Traffic Police Division, the Department of Transport Management, and the Department of Environment.“Vehicle emission testing is mainly the responsibility of the agencies under the federal government, but the constitution has also given local governments the authority to take measures to reduce pollution,” said Sarita Rai, chief of the Environment Department. “We also have developed pollution control guidelines as per the KMC Environment and Natural Resources Protection Act-2021.”Officials say vehicle emission testing will start once the pollution control guidelines are published in the metropolis gazette. In the first phase, emissions of petrol and diesel vehicles operating in the metropolis will be randomly tested, and the city office has also planned to carry out emission testing for motorcycles.Emission testing will be carried out on vehicles that have passed emission testing from the Department of Transport Management and received green stickers. Officials say that vehicles with green stickers could still emit black smoke for various reasons, including lack of timely servicing and maintenance.“We have seen many vehicles with green stickers emitting black smoke,” an official at the Environment Department of the KMC said, asking not to be named as the official is not authorised to talk to the media. “Many automobile owners only service their vehicles ahead of the annual pollution testing.” Officials say that the amount of the fine will be determined based on the suggestions of stakeholders.Vehicle emission testing is among the measures the city office has been taking to reduce pollution levels in the metropolis.The KMC has also started independently monitoring the city's air quality, with support from the Partnership for Healthy Cities, which has provided 19 portable devices to the city office.The Partnership for Healthy Cities is a global network of 74 cities, including the Kathmandu metropolis, committed to saving lives by preventing noncommunicable diseases and injuries. The programme is supported by Bloomberg Philanthropies in partnership with the World Health Organisation and Vital Strategies.Nepal’s air quality reaches hazardous levels several times a year during winter and summer, and the capital city often ranks as the world’s most polluted metropolis. Major hospitals also report a spike in respiratory problems due to the impact of toxic air and dust. Doctors warn that people get sick from respiratory illnesses caused by polluted air throughout the year, due to polluted air.Doctors say air pollution is known to cause various respiratory illnesses. Poor air quality can cause short- and long-term effects on public health. In the short term, it can lead to pneumonia, bronchitis, conjunctivitis, skin allergy, stroke, and heart problems, and in the long run it can lead to severe conditions like ulcers, and cancer of the lungs and intestine, kidney disease, and heart complications.People in low- and middle-income countries get disproportionately affected by the polluted air, which accounts for more than 90 percent of deaths, according to the World Health Organisation.Several studies carried out in the past in Nepal show that toxic air takes a huge toll on public health. Along with respiratory illness, the toxic air has led to severe conditions like ulcers, cancer of the lungs and intestine, kidney disease, heart complications, high blood pressure and stroke, according to experts.The report, titled “Global burden and strength of evidence for 88 risk factors in 204 countries and 811 subnational locations, 1990–2021: A systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2021,” finds that air pollution was the leading contributor to the global disease burden in 2021, making for eight percent of total disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), followed by high blood pressure (7.8 percent). The report was published in The Lancet, a leading international medical journal.Studies carried out in the past show that polluted air has been shortening people’s lives. Nepali lives are being cut short by around five years, according to a report by the Air Quality Life Index (AQLI), which converts air pollution concentration into an impact on life expectancy. AQLI is a metric produced by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago.Toxic air is deadlier than tobacco use and high blood pressure, which reduce life by 2.8 years and 1.7 years, respectively, according to the report.Environment experts in Nepal often point out that worsening air quality has not only affected people’s health but also hit the economy and hindered overall development of the country. \nTicket bookings for public transport during the Dashain festival will open this Saturday. Following discussions with stakeholders, the Department of Transport Management announced that tickets will be available online and at counters to manage the expected surge of nearly two million travellers leaving the Kathmandu Valley for the festivities.According to the department’s Director General, Rajiv Pokharel, transport operators will facilitate online bookings. “We have instructed operators to arrange online bookings wherever possible,” he said. “For counter bookings, passengers must obtain tickets only from official staff wearing uniforms and identification badges.”Around two million people are estimated to leave the Kathmandu Valley during Dashain. The department has introduced 20-point directives to ensure safe and hassle-free travel. Key measures include mandatory checks for alcohol consumption by drivers at major entry and exit points and the requirement for two drivers on long-distance routes. Additionally, those under 18 cannot work as assistant drivers.To assist travellers during Dashain, Tihar, and Chhath festivals, citizen help desks will be established at major locations such as Nagdhunga, Kalanki, Swayambhu, Halchowk, Machhapokhari, Gongabu Bus Park, Chabahil, Tilganga, Koteshwar, Jagati, Satdobato, Balkhu, Dakshinkali, Sundhara, and Sangha in Kavre. An inspection team comprising officials from various agencies will monitor travel arrangements with support from provincial transport ministries.Public transport operating on long and medium-distance routes must follow a designated queue system. Transport expert Ashish Gajurel noted that although bookings are open each year, passengers face difficulties. \"Bus operators don’t increase the number of buses during Dashain, despite rising demand. Authorities must increase the number of buses to ease travel,\" he said.Saroj Sitaula, senior vice-president of the Federation of Nepalese National Transport Entrepreneurs, however, argued that ‘unnecessary’ vehicle checks should be avoided to prevent inconvenience for passengers and drivers. He also highlighted the need to repair potholes on roads to ensure smooth travel.Earlier, Minister for Physical Infrastructure and Transport Devendra Dahal instructed the Department of Roads to complete road repairs nationwide before Ghatasthapana, the first day of the 15-day Dashain festival. The department reported that repairs are underway but have been delayed by the monsoon.The Narayanghat-Butwal road section, part of the East-West Highway, remains a major concern, with only 52.7 percent of its upgrade completed after six years of construction and multiple deadline extensions. The Meteorological Forecasting Division of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology has predicted chances of rainfall in various places of the country for a couple of days more, raising concerns about travel difficulties during Dashain. Other problematic sections include Nagdhunga-Mugling and Mugling-Pokhara, with landslides and potholes reported along various highways, including the Mid-Hill, Madan Bhandari, Hulaki, and BP highways. \nPanic gripped locals in ward 12 of Chandragiri Municipality, Kathmandu, on Thursday morning after a suspicious object was found in the locality.The suspicious object was spotted in front of Balambu Secondary School, sparking fears of a bomb threat.Locals informed the police, and a bomb disposal team from the Nepal Army arrived at the scene. According to the NA Directorate of Public Relations and Information, the team disposed of the suspicious object, which turned out to be a pressure cooker.   \nKathmandu Metropolitan City has extended the area to prohibit building any structure on either side of the rivers in its territory.In a notice on Wednesday, the city office stated that construction of any structure has been barred on the additional 20 meters from the existing prohibited area.According to the metropolis notice, if the city has, under the existing rule, prohibited any construction on 20 meters from the area marked as river, the prohibited area will now be altogether 40 meters on either side of the waterway.The metropolis said the decision was taken based on a recent Supreme Court verdict that directed the authorities concerned to prohibit construction within an additional 20 metres from riverbanks in the Kathmandu Valley.Currently, construction is permitted only 20 metres beyond major riverbanks in the Kathmandu metropolis.The notice issued by the metropolis states, “No construction will be permitted on an additional 20 metres of land on either side of the river, and ongoing construction will be halted.”It has also asked one and all not to release contaminated water, including sewage, into Bagmati River and its tributaries. “Private and government buildings, as well as commercial properties, must install soak pits for groundwater recharge,” it said. “Waste must not be disposed of in the rivers. Non-compliance will lead to legal action under existing laws.” \n\nNIMB officially launched Nepal’s first Visa Wearable Sticker, branded as NIMB Paywear, at an event held in Kathmandu on Thursday.The groundbreaking payment solution, which allows customers to make secure contactless transactions by tapping a wearable device at any POS terminal, was unveiled in Nepal, marking a new era for digital payments.In the presentation, the bank highlighted how NIMB Paywear is designed to speed up, simplify, and secure daily transactions, offering customers an alternative to carrying physical cards or mobile wallets.“NIMB Paywear is a game-changer for the Nepali market,” said Mahesh Sharma Dhakal, senior deputy CEO of NIMB. “This product will transform how our customers make payments, offering them unparalleled convenience and speed while ensuring the highest levels of security. We are excited to be the first Bank in Nepal to introduce this technology, once again positioning NIMB as a leader in digital innovation.”NIMB Paywear allows users to attach the wearable sticker to any personal item, such as watches, keychains, or phone cases, making it highly versatile and convenient. Users can pay by tapping the device at any contactless POS terminal, perfect for quick and secure everyday transactions.In compliance with Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) regulations, contactless payments above Rs5,000 will require a PIN, adding an extra layer of security for high-value transactions. To celebrate the launch, NIMB announced an exciting promotional offer. Customers who apply for and activate their NIMB Paywear stickers within the first three months will have their wearable fee of Rs1,000 refunded upon completing 12 POS transactions within that period.  \nCan paddy yield be predicted two months before harvest?A new research finds this possible.A groundbreaking study combining advanced remote sensing technology with machine learning shows promising results for predicting paddy yield two months before harvest.The study uses solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), which directly measures plants' photosynthetic activity, offering real-time insights into their health and stress levels. This differs from traditional methods, which rely on canopy characteristics like greenness and often miss important physiological changes in plants. “SIF gives us a clearer picture of crop potential, especially under stressful environmental conditions,” said Manoj Lamichhane, a PhD student at South Dakota State University in the US, one of the study's authors.The study presents a robust data-driven approach to predicting rice yield in Nepal by integrating SIF with traditional remote sensing and environmental data. A key strength of the research is utilising a multi-source dataset, which includes SIF, and biophysical, climatic and soil variables. The study provides valuable insights into paddy yield prediction by exploring various time windows in machine learning models for growing periods of these variables.Analysis revealed that soil variables, mainly sand and P2O5, are the most critical factors in predicting paddy yield. Climatic properties, vegetation indices, and SIF variables such as precipitation and water deficit follow them. According to the research, integrating SIF with traditional remote sensing and environmental variables reduces the prediction error by 21 percent. “When tested on unseen data, our model accurately predicted rice yield across all districts in Nepal, aligning closely with observed data. This fitted model can predict paddy yield using features from July to September,” according to the study. “Given that the rice harvest in Nepal occurs in November, yield predictions can be made as early as two months before harvest, providing valuable lead time for decision-making.”The study said that future research could explore applying this approach in other major paddy-producing countries across Southeast Asia to evaluate its effectiveness and adaptability to different regional conditions.Experts say new research conducted in the Tarai offers hope for improving agricultural productivity and food security in Nepal, where rice plays a vital role in the diet, rural income, and economic growth. The plains account for 71 percent of Nepal’s total paddy acreage, the hills for 25 percent, and the mountain region for 4 percent.Paddy is Nepal’s biggest earning farm commodity, with tens of thousands of farmers relying on its income. According to economists, the high output may cool down inflation and pump up the economy.Paddy production in Nepal, particularly in the Tarai belt, faces increasing challenges due to climate change and unpredictable weather patterns, which can severely impact yields. Using machine learning models, researchers say they can predict rice yields based on various environmental factors, such as rainfall, temperature, and soil conditions. The study's findings underscore the importance of adequate rainfall during August and September. “Our research shows that rainfall during these critical months directly influences yields. This means that efficient water management during this period is crucial,” said Dr Sushant Mehan, assistant professor at South Dakota State University.Soil health also emerged as a key factor in the study. The research highlights the importance of maintaining phosphorus levels, a nutrient essential for rice growth. “Farmers should regularly test their soil and apply the necessary fertilisers, particularly phosphorus-based ones,” added Mehan, emphasising the need for sustainable soil management practices.This research has significant implications not only for farmers but also for policymakers. By providing early yield predictions, the study enables better planning for food security and supply chains, helping to avert potential shortages. Rajendra Uprety, a rice expert, told the Post that early yield predictions could primarily benefit a country like Nepal. For instance, according to Uprety, farmers will be encouraged to insure their paddy based on early yield predictions. “Besides, if farmers know that they are getting a good yield two months before the harvest, they can increase investment in paddy. The investment will enable farmers to adopt commercial farming from the subsistence farming method.”Since paddy output is directly linked to the country’s economic growth, the government and policymakers can accurately forecast the country's economic growth, including inflation. “Low output means it will put pressure on the price, and accordingly, the government can plan for imports,” said Uprety. “Thus, prices will remain stable.”He said that neighbouring India has recently lifted the ban on the export of rice following a projection that it will have a bumper rice harvest this year. On September 28, the Indian government lifted the non-basmati white rice export ban. This change follows a prohibition to enhance domestic supply since July 20, 2023.“Early prediction will enable Nepal, just like India, to know what Nepal’s requirement is in case of low production,” said Uprety. “These early predictions allow farmers and the government to prepare in advance, ensuring that enough rice is available even during years of low production,” said Sagar Kafle, assistant professor at Tribhuvan University, one of the study's authors.“As climate change continues to impact agriculture in Nepal, this study offers a roadmap for increasing resilience in rice production. The findings could play a crucial role in helping Nepal maintain stable paddy yields, securing both livelihoods and food supplies for the country’s population.”Despite the El Niño phenomenon, Nepali farmers harvested a record 5.72 million tonnes of paddy in the last fiscal year, ended mid-July.Paddy production grew 4.33 percent year-on-year. The country has 1.43 million hectares of land suitable for growing paddy. The grain is generally planted twice a year—in June and March. However, spring paddy is planted only on 104,712 hectares. According to the agriculture ministry, paddy's contribution to the country’s gross domestic product amounts to 4 percent. \nTravellers on international airlines will soon benefit from higher compensation limits. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) announced that the Montreal Convention liability limits for death, injury, delays, baggage, and cargo issues will increase on December 28, 2024. Nepal implemented the Montreal Convention for the first time on December 15, 2018. Millions of air passengers worldwide are entitled to compensation for yearly flight delays, cancellations, and overbooking. Because passengers are unaware of their rights and airlines make it so hard to get their money, less than 2 percent receive their flight compensation, according to a study. Here is what you need to know about the Montreal Convention and your air passenger rights. Claim what you owe.What is the Montreal Convention 1999 or MC99?The Montreal Convention is a multilateral treaty adopted by a diplomatic meeting of International Civil Aviation Organisation member states in 1999. Ratified in 1999 and enacted in 2003, the Montreal Convention was a successor to the Warsaw Convention 1929.Formally known as the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air, the Montreal Convention 1999 (or MC99) has established a comprehensive and unified framework for the international carriage of passengers, baggage, and cargo by air. It introduced several elements to balance the interests of travellers, cargo shippers, and the aviation industry. The Convention sets liability limits for airlines, ensuring fair compensation for consumers in cases of injury, death, delay, baggage and cargo issues. ICAO has informed the 140 State Parties that the limits will increase in line with the Convention’s built-in review mechanism, which adjusts for inflation every five years. This ensures that passenger and cargo compensation remains appropriate over time. This is the fourth review since the treaty came into force in 2003. \"ICAO continues to advocate for the universal ratification of MC99,\" said Juan Carlos Salazar, the ICAO secretary general, in a statement. \"This Convention is fundamental in protecting consumer interests in international air travel. By promoting harmonisation and codification of rules governing international carriage by air, MC99 benefits passengers and cargo shippers while enabling the unified and equitable development of air services.\"What are the liability provisions?The liability limits are indicated in Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), a unit of account defined by the International Monetary Fund. For indicative purposes, 1 SDR has been valued at US$ 1.33318 on October 18, 2024. What are the revisions? The limits will be revised as follows: 1. The death or bodily injury limit will increase from 128,821 SDRs to 151,880 SDRs (about US$202,500). It originally was 100,000 SDRs in 2003. 2. The limit for passenger transport delays will rise from 5,346 SDRs to 6,303 SDRs (about US$8,400). 3. The limit for baggage destruction, loss, damage, or delay will increase from 1,288 SDRs to 1,519 SDRs (about US$2,000). 4. The limit for cargo destruction, loss, damage, or delay will rise from 22 SDRs to 26 SDRs per kilogram (about US$35). ICAO has invited the States Parties to MC99 to make provisions as necessary in accordance with their domestic legal requirements, to give full effect to the revised limits as of December 28, 2024.What’s the case of Nepal?The Montreal Convention allows air passengers on international flights to claim compensation for damages caused by travel disruptions and luggage problems. Since travellers in Nepal are not aware that they can file a compensation claim, many passengers protest at the airport against the delays, cancellations, baggage damages and other issues caused by the airlines' negligence. For example, if the passengers' baggage is damaged, under the rule, passengers can claim up to $2,000 with the particular airline.However, the Montreal Convention waives the airline’s liability in cases where extraordinary circumstances caused the flight disruption. Such cases include adverse weather, Air Traffic congestion and restrictions, lightning strikes, bird strikes, strikes at the airport, medical emergencies, security threats, and political unrest, etc. You can also claim when … ?On November 30 last year, Flight RA229 of the state-owned Nepal Airlines flew two hours before its scheduled departure, leaving 31 passengers stranded at midnight at Kathmandu’s Tribhuvan International Airport. The reason for the rushed departure was the flight’s VVIP status. Then-prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal was on the same flight. The flight was planned for Dahal, who left for Dubai leading the Nepali delegation to the 28th Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 28). According to experts, the case is severe negligence by the airline company, and passengers can still file compensation cases as per the Convention.The MC99 extends a time frame within which a passenger can claim compensation for damages – up to two years following the occurrence of the flight disruption. If the claim pertains to damaged, lost, or delayed luggage, it's imperative to report the issue expeditiously. Claims for damaged baggage should be filed within seven days, while claims for delayed baggage must be initiated within 21 days. If your bags remain unclaimed for more than 21 days and are considered lost, you still can file a claim within two years.Where to file the claims?According to Vijay Shrestha, vice-president of administration at Himalaya Airlines, passengers can file a compensation claim by filling out a “property irregularity form” at the airline office or the airline’s ground handling agent in any destination airport.Luggage will be categorised as lost if the airline cannot trace it for 21 days from filing the property irregularity report. All claims shall be substantiated with an itemised list of contents, description, age, and proof of purchase or ownership of all items. At Kathmandu airport, passengers can file compensation claims for loss, delay, or damage at the lost and found unit of Nepal Airlines. “The compensation provision used to be printed on tickets, but since airlines issue e-tickets nowadays, passengers can go to the ‘contract of carriage by air’ on the airline's website to know the information regarding the loss, delay, or damage,” said Shrestha. Is MC99 applicable to domestic airlines? The MC99 makes only international airlines liable in case of passenger death or injury.A year after Nepal adopted the MC99, preparations for adopting a similar law started but could not proceed, although the draft had been prepared.Tourism ministry officials say the process was stalled multiple times as governments changed. Since 2019, there have been six fatal plane and helicopter crashes that killed 130 people, and all the families of the victims have been barred from a justifiable compensation that would be $100,000 as per the proposed provisions.The air carriers’ liability and insurance draft bill for domestic airlines has been sent to the finance ministries for their comments before being tabled by the Cabinet. After the Cabinet nod, the bill will be tabled in Parliament.What’s the provision in the proposed domestic law? As per the planned law, domestic airlines have to pay a minimum compensation of $100,000 for the injury or death of a passenger. Currently, the minimum compensation for passenger death on a domestic flight is $20,000.According to the proposed law, a compensation claim should be filed with the airline or its agents within 60 days of the incident or accident. The carrier’s liability limitation for cargo lost and damaged shall be $20 per kg if the damage was caused or contributed to by the negligence of the airlines, it says. The cargo damage is limited up to $5,000.The compensation for the hand baggage, if lost or damaged, shall be $400.Under the Montreal Convention 1999, effective as of December 28, 2019, a carrier’s liability limitation for cargo lost, damaged or delayed shall be 22 SDRs per kg ($29.21 per kg) in the case of destruction, loss, damage or delay concerning cargo carriage.Carriers must pay 1,288 SDRs ($1,709.90) for each passenger in case of baggage destruction, loss, damage, or delay.Likewise, 5,346 SDRs ($7,097.16) should be compensated for each passenger in relation to damage caused by delay in the carriage of persons. \nIn a bid to ensure basic health care services to metropolis residents, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City has started setting up laboratories and physiotherapy equipment in all of its 32 urban health promotion centres.Health officials at the city office believe this move will help improve the existing basic health care service and address the rising demand for physiotherapy services.“Due to the lack of laboratory services in most of our urban health clinics, patients have been forced to seek services at state-run hospitals and private centres, which are often overcrowded and expensive,” said Deepak Kumar KC, chief of the health department of the metropolis. “At our health facilities, we will provide all services free of cost to needy patients.”The city office runs 32 urban health promotion centres, one in each ward of the metropolis. KC said the metropolis opened vacancies to hire 108 staffers, including 32 physiotherapists, 29 lab technicians, four medical officers, five staff nurses, 10 radiographers, 10 pharmacy assistants, and 26 peons for the urban health clinics.The city office provides 98 types of essential medicines—for communicable and non-communicable diseases, including high blood pressure, diabetes, mental health, heart disease, asthma, cholesterol, and respiratory problems—free of cost.Patients with government health insurance can get over 300 types of medicines from urban health clinics, according to health officials.KC said that physiotherapy and laboratory services would be available within six weeks. The metropolis has already been running laboratories in six urban health clinics.Providing free physiotherapy and laboratory testing is among the health services the city office plans to offer to the residents of the metropolis.Earlier, KMC provided mental health screening training to doctors and paramedics serving at urban health promotion centres. Officials hoped that the move would help hundreds of mental health patients in the city get timely treatment. Officials say that they are also planning to provide free medication to patients with mental health problems.Although neither the federal government agency nor the city office has data on the number of people suffering from mental health problems in the metropolis, doctors estimated that many residents could be suffering from various forms of mental health problems including anxiety and depression, among others. Health workers say that many city residents, despite having mental health problems, do not seek treatment and instead turn to drugs and substances to cope. Due to entrenched social stigma, fear of discrimination, and other factors, many patients in Nepal do not openly discuss their mental health issues.The metropolis has upgraded its urban health clinics to urban health promotion centres and started providing services through medical doctors. The idea behind starting health promotion centres is to provide comprehensive healthcare services to the city dwellers, especially those who cannot afford to go to expensive health facilities and buy costly medicines, according to officials. \nA 60-year-old man from ward 7 of Bidur Municipality in Nuwakot district, succumbed to dengue on Wednesday night.The man was first rushed to Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital (TUTH) on Monday night as his condition deteriorated, and later to a private hospital for intensive care due to a lack of vacant intensive care unit beds at the TUTH.Doctors attending the victim suffered from severe dengue, which led to shock, internal bleeding and multiorgan failure.Officials at the Ministry of Health and Population, however, claimed that dengue was not the direct cause of death, as the victim also had high blood pressure. They claimed that while infection rates have increased of late, the number of severe cases and deaths has not increased proportionately. But experts say the situation is far worse than what the authorities admit.The rise in infection rate has not only overwhelmed general hospitals of the Kathmandu Valley, but also caused an acute blood crisis, increased premature birth, low birth weight, and a shortage of paracetamol in pharmacies. “Many patients suffering from dengue shock syndrome, hemorrhagic fever, pneumonia, diarrhoea, and multi-organ failure due to severe dengue have been admitted to our hospital,” said Dr Niraj Bam, an associate professor at the Institute of Medicine, TUTH. “Agencies responsible must take measures immediately to break the chain of the infection and prevent an exponential rise in new cases.”Public health experts blame the apathy of health agencies and government for the exponential rise in cases. They say neither the concerned health agencies nor the government are taking the situation seriously.“Previously, we used to carry out search and destroy drives frequently to destroy mosquito breeding sites, launch awareness drives, and request security agencies for blood donations to manage the dengue epidemic,” said Dr Baburam Marasini, former director at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “But now, no measures are being taken to control the spread of the virus. None of the agencies has considered dengue as a public health emergency.”Experts said more concerning is the fact that the authorities have been attempting to conceal the infection and death rates to avoid criticism, and this is worsening the impact on the general public. “Hundreds of people wait for hours every day for blood at blood banks for their seriously ailing relatives admitted at various hospitals in Kathmandu Valley,” said Sandesh Thapa, a public relations officer at the Central Blood Transfusion Service (blood bank). “But the collection is too low. Even organisations in districts outside the Valley are unable to organise blood donation camps.”Officials at the blood bank said daily demand is around 400 pints, mostly from dengue patients, while donations are only around 30 to 40 pints.“Since the morning, I have received around 40 calls from organisations that previously organised blood donation camps, asking for blood for their former donors,” said Thapa. “But blood can’t be manufactured or bought, and the rise in dengue cases along with the festive season has reduced donations.”Blood bank officials have been asking the relatives of patients to find donors on their own and to post donation requests on social media.Public health experts warn of dire consequences if the seriousness of the dengue outbreak continues to be undermined. They say that the rise in premature births, low birth weights of newborns, and complications in pregnancy will lead to maternal and child mortality rates and jeopardise the achievements made from years of investments and endeavours. “A lot of people have been hospitalised, and hundreds more have been infected. Their experiences are harrowing,” said Dr Ghanshyam Gurung, executive director at the TUTH. “Authorities should not wait for the temperature to drop and the infection rate to decline naturally.”Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika viruses, according to the World Health Organisation.So far, only 11 people have died, and over 22,000 have been infected since the start of 2024 if the government data is to be believed. Experts say reported dengue cases may only represent a small fraction of the true scale of the outbreak, as around 90 percent of the infected people do not show any symptoms and health authorities often concealed the actual number of deaths and infections.As there is no specific treatment for dengue, health workers provide symptomatic care and diagnose patients based on symptoms, including platelet-rich plasma transfusion.According to doctors, mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes are some symptoms of dengue.The World Health Organisation (WHO) says there is no specific treatment for severe dengue, but early detection and access to proper medical care can save lives.Meanwhile, in view of the rising dengue cases, a meeting of the Council of Ministers on Thursday has decided to conduct a 10-minute cleanup campaign in all government offices at 10 am on Friday to remove mosquito breeding sites. The decision was made on the recommendation of the Ministry of Health. Officials said staffers will look for stagnant water in puddles, discarded tyres and bottles, among other things, during the campaign.  \nNepal will receive HPV vaccine doses from GAVI in December for a nationwide vaccination campaign starting in February to immunize 1.68 million girls aged 10-14, significantly reducing cervical cancer risk as HPV is the major cause.\nGovernment-funded medical care for impoverished burn victims in selected state-run hospitals and reembolsoarsment in others, with concerns over lack of specialized care and need for investments in advanced facilities.\nPregnant women in Nepal experience an alarming rise in dengue infections, endangering maternal and newborn health amid a nationwide outbreak that has caused numerous deaths and infections.\nDusit Princess Kathmandu hosts a 5-day trout festival featuring 12 unique dishes, showcasing the versatility and health benefits of locally sourced Nepali trout.\nA young Nepalese girl learns to navigate the challenges of home baking, discovering the scientific principles and techniques that transform simple ingredients into delicious treats.\nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nNamibia captain Merwe Gerhard Erasmus has signed for Kathmandu Gurkhas for the Nepal Premier League (NPL) T20 cricket tournament, the team said on Friday.The first edition of the NPL is set to begin on November 30 in Kathmandu. Erasmus, who was named ICC’s Player of the Year in 2022, has played 52 One Day Internationals and 65 Twenty20 Internationals for Namibia, scoring nearly 2,000 runs and taking 38 wickets in ODIs, and amassing 1,557 runs and 53 wickets in T20Is.Erasmus led Namibia to the Super 12 stage of the 2021 T20 World Cup, securing an 8-wicket victory against Ireland with an unbeaten 53-run knock. In February this year, Erasmus helped Namibia win three out of four games during the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup League 2 Nepal Tri-Series, involving Nepal, Namibia and the Netherlands.\"Merwe Gerhard Erasmus is one of the finest players in Associate cricket, and he's a true leader for his team. His arrival will significantly strengthen Kathmandu Gurkhas in both batting and bowling, and his leadership skills will also be a big boost. We are eagerly looking forward to his arrival,\" said Sandesh Katwal, chief executive officer of Kathmandu Gurkhas.Erasmus, who also plays in the International League T20 (ILT20) in Dubai, said he is very excited to join Kathmandu Gurkhas for the NPL. \"I am extremely proud to become a member of the Gurkhas family. Representing an iconic team in a country known for its courage and strength, Nepal, is a greathonour for me,\" said Erasmus. \"We are ready to bring that fearless spirit to the cricket field and make it memorable.\"Erasmus is the second foreign player to join Kathmandu Gurkhas after the team also signed Netherlands opener Michael Levitt, who holds the record for the fastest T20 International century for his country. In March, Levitt scored a blistering 135 off 62 balls against Namibia in Kathmandu, reaching his century in just 49 balls. During that tour, Levitt also made two half centuries in three T20Is against Nepal.Kathmandu Gurkhas, owned by Kathmandu Sports Development Venture, has Karan KC as their marquee player. The Gurkhas have also bought Shahab Alam, Bhim Sharki, Rashid Khan, Shankar Rana, Krishna Karki, Dipesh Kandel, Sumit Maharjan, Raju Rijal, Vivek KC and Pratik Shrestha through auction. \nNepal will face off against India in the semi-finals of the SAFF Women’s Championship in a repeat of last edition’s clash after they demolished Sri Lanka 6-0 in a completely one-sided affair at the Dasharath Stadium in Kathmandu on Thursday to progress as group winners.Rekha Paudel scored a brace, while Sabitra Bhandari, Sabita Rana Magar, Amisha Karki and Rashmi Kumari Ghising were also on target for Nepal.Nepali women have now reached the semi-finals of the SAFF champions in all seven editions of the tournament since its inception in 2010.The outcome gave coach Rajendra Tamang’s team seven points from three matches and helped them top Group A on goal difference.Earlier, Bhutan mauled the Maldives 13-0—this edition’s biggest victory so far—to progress into the last four.Deki Lhazom scored five goals, while Pema Choden and Tshering Yanden were at the double for Bhutan. Sonam Choden, Namgyel Dema, Deki Yangdon and Tshering Lhaden also netted for Bhutan.The result left Nepal needing a victory of at least a six-goal margin to top Bhutan, who had scored a total of 17 goals and conceded one, on goal difference and avoid a clash against defending champions Bangladesh, who on Wednesday outclassed five-time champions India 3-1 to show their intent to win a second straight title after breaking India’s iron grip of the throne last edition.Nepal have yet to win the SAFF Womens’ title despite reaching the final in five of the previous six editions. Nepal are also looking to win their first ever silverware in the international competition.Coach Tamang said before the game that Nepal would aim for a victory against Sri Lanka rather than winning big and aiming to topple Bhutan on the top of the group table.However, as the game progressed, it was a test of determination for Nepal to score the sixth, which they passed in the fourth minute of stoppage time through Ghising, who was scoreless in previous two matches.Nepal were also boosted by the return of Sabitra Bhandari, who plays for French women’s first division club Ev Avant Guingamp, to the starting Xi after missing the star striker in the first two games.Bhandari’s presence was immediately felt as she showed her pace and accuracy to cut inside from the right and set up Rana Magar, who confidently placed the ball into the back of the net to give Nepal the lead in the 8th minute.Bhandari then doubled Nepal’s advantage in the 12th, wonderfully curling a strike from outside the box for a world-class finish.Rekha Paudel, who shone in the absence of Bhandari in the clash against the Maldives finding the net five times, scored Nepal’s third a minute later with a marvelous volley.Paudel then scored her individual seventh goal and team’s fourth in the 36th, back-flicking a shot from Bhandari. Her flick added a touch of magic to Bhandari’s effort as the ball changed its course and tricked Sri Lanka goalkeeper Weerasingha before entering the net.When Nepal went into the half-time with a comfortable 4-0 lead—like they did against the Maldives in their 11-0 victory—hopes were lit that they could complete another goal fest against Sri Lanka as well.But the Sri Lankan defenders did not give up easily and remained dead set on preventing Nepal from scoring their sixth goal.Karki took Nepal closer to the target of a six-goal margin victory, adding Nepal’s fifth two minutes into the restart, heading a cross from Rana Magar.Soon, the game turned into a contest and struggle for finding the net at least once more and a frantic defending to prevent that from happening, with the Sri Lankan bench rejoicing in each save and defence.Rekha should have completed the job at the stroke of hour mark when Saru Limbu set her up with a golden chance to score from close range but she missed it.Bhandari came close to scoring twice but was denied both times, first by Navan Jana Perera with a goal-line clearance and then the goalkeeper.Rekha thought she finally broke the Sri Lanka resistance in the 83rd but her goal was disallowed for an offside.Tensions surrounded the packed stadium as the game entered into the seven minutes of stoppage time.Ghising finally got the sixth goal all were looking for heading in a corner from second-half substitute Anita Basnet, sending the crowd into frenzy. “I am very happy for the support we got from the supporters because it added a lot of energy into our team,” said player of the match Rana Magar. “Our team played well today. Thanks to my teammates for an amazing performance.”Nepal will now aim to defeat India in the last four again and for a second time in the competition's history. They had defeated India 1-0 in the semi-finals two years ago for their first ever win over the side in the regional competition. \nNepal were thrashed 9-2 by Japan in their opening match of the AFC U-17 Asian Cup Qualifiers in Qatar on Wednesday.Nepal initially took the lead with Sabin Kumar Magar scoring in the 12th minute, but Japan quickly retaliated with a barrage of goals. Daichi Tani was the standout performer, netting four times in the 17th, 38th, 41st, and 61st minutes. Hiroto Asada added three goals in the 19th minute, injury time of the first half, and the 64th minute. Mibuki Kasai and Kaiji Chonan completed Japan’s scoring with goals in the 73rd and 77th minutes, respectively. Bigyan Khadka managed a late consolation for Nepal in the 88th minute. In an earlier match, Qatar defeated Mongolia 2-0. Nepal will next face Qatar on Friday, while Mongolia are set to play Japan. \nDefending champions Bangladesh showed their intent to win the SAFF Women’s Championship trophy for a second straight time as they defeated India 3-1 in their last Group A match at the Dasharath Stadium in Kathmandu on Wednesday.Tohura Khatun scored a brace after Afeida Khandaker opened the scoring for Bangladesh. Bala Devi Ngangom pulled one back for India.It was Bangladesh’s second consecutive victory over India in the group stage of the SAFF women’s competition, having also beaten them 3-0 in 2022.Two years ago, the Bengal Tigresses broke five-time champions India’s sole domination on the throne since the inception of the competition 14 years ago by winning the title for the first time and the outcome serves as a clear statement Bangladesh are in Kathmandu again to repeat the feat.The victory also helped Bangladesh progress into the semi-finals as group winners with four points. They will face the runners-up of Group B in the last four.Nepal currently occupy the top spot in Group B due to goal difference despite being square with Bhutan on four points. Nepal face Sri Lanka and Bhutan meet the Maldives in the final group games on Thursday.India advanced as the second-placed team in the group with three points and will lock horns against the Group B winners for a place in the final after missing out on the title match for the first time in 2022.There were questions whether Bangladesh would be able to keep their title defence on track under their new coach Peter James Butler when they had to rely on a stoppage time goal from Shamsunnahar Junior to rescue a draw against less fancied Pakistan.But the Tigresses were a different side against India and kept their opponents under pressure from early on, with Shamsunnahar Junior reaching closer to goal in the 5th minute.Bangladesh had to survive a scare in the 11th when a blunder from their goalkeeper Rupna Chakma almost allowed Manisha Kalyan to score.But Bangladesh quickly regrouped and took the lead in the 19th minute when Khandaker surprised unfortunate India goalkeeper Panthoi Chanu and defenders with a chip shot after the goalie’s poor attempt to grab a corner fell into her path.Bangladesh continued to knock at India’s door with attacks after attacks, with Ritu Porna Chakma rattling the crossbar in the 26th.The pressure paid off again as Tohura doubled Bangladesh’s lead three minutes later. Indian goalie Chanu was at fault again as her another poor goalkeeping effort to keep away a cross from Ritu allowed Tohura to tap in from close range.Bala Devi Ngangom should have reduced the deficit in the 35th when Ranjana Chanu Sorokhaibam set her up for an open chance with a perfect cross just outside the six yard box but the striker shot straight at the goalkeeper.India’s Kalyan went close to scoring minutes later but her freekick hit the crossbar.Bangladesh then punished India for missed opportunities furthering their lead in the 42nd. Shamsunnahar Senior and Shamsunnahar Junior combined to set up Tohura whose missile from the edge of the area gave India netkeeper Chanu no chance.India were finally able to find some breathing space a minutes later when Bangladesh goalkeeper Rupna’s feeble effort to stop a cross from Dalima Chhibber let Bala Devi to head comfortably over her.But Rupna became the hero of Bangladesh after the break as she made two brilliant saves to keep out superb efforts from Sanju—in the 56th—and second half substitute Jyoti Chauhan—in the 62nd.India continued their search for goals with no fruit and it was Bangladesh who nearly got their fourth in the 80th with Sapna Rani forcing India’s Chanu into a finger tip save with a long-ranged shot. \nRekha Paudel scored five goals and Preeti Rai netted a hat-trick as Nepal demolished the Maldives 11-0 in a total domination in their second Group B match of the SAFF Women’s Championship at the Dasharath Stadium in Kathmandu on Monday.Sabita Rana Magar, Anita KC and Amisha Karki were also on target for Nepal.The victory margin is Nepal’s third biggest win in the SAFF Women’s competition, and fourth overall. They had beaten Afghanistan 13-0 and Pakistan 12-0 during the group stage of the inaugural SAFF Women’s Championship in 2010 in Bangladesh. India hold the record for the biggest win of the competition, having defeated Bhutan with a scoreline of 18-0, also in the 2010 edition.The win against the Maldives is also a clear message that coach Rajendra Tamang’s team, who were held to a 0-0 draw by Bhutan in their opening match, are still favoured to win their maiden trophy after reaching final in five of the six previous editions.Coach Tamang made five changes in the squad that played a goalless stalemate against Bhutan, resting captain and goalkeeper Anjila Tumbapo Subba and star forward Sabitra Bhandari, who arrived in Kathmandu from France on Monday morning. Second choice goalkeeper Anjana Rana Magar, Rekha Paudel, Bimala BK, Bimala Chaudhary and Nisha Thokar started against the Maldives.Hira Bhujel and Dipa Shahi, who were stretchered off during the Bhutan clash due to injuries, are set to miss the rest of the SAFF championship.Nepal women were under a huge pressure after going winless against Bhutan for the first time in their SAFF history.The presence of Bhandari was also badly missed and there were doubts whether Nepal could deliver against the Maldives.But Paudel did not let the absence of Bhandari gloom the crowd again.Nepal were totally dominant from the start, pushing the Maldives to a frantic defending from early on.The pressure immediately paid off as Rai started the goal rush when her low shot from the left astonishingly beat two defenders before squeezing past Maldives goalkeeper Aminath Leeza in the 5th minute.The early setback woke up Leeza and the goalkeeper put all her effort to deny Paudel twice and Rashmi Ghising once to keep Nepal from scoring further.But Sabita Rana Magar undid Leeza in the 29th minute with a well-measured left-footed long ranger, which suddenly opened the floodgates. Paudel smelled blood and scored twice before the break—first flicking a cross from Ghising in the 32nd minute and then tapping in a pass from Sabita in the 42nd minute. The goal fest continued after the break as well. Paudel then completed her hat-trick three minutes into the restart smashing the roof of the net from close range after Aminath Zaahiya failed to clear her first attempt from a tight angle.Paudel got her fourth in the 63rd minute after Saru Limbu, who also engineered Nepal’s fifth goal earlier, put her through with a clever pass.Rai scored a screamer in the 65th for her individual second, arrowing from the edge of the box after Paudel cut back for her.Anita KC got Nepal’s eighth in the 69th seconds after coming off the bench after running into substitute Anita Basnet’s pass that collected a bit of luck off a deflection from Hawwa Haneefa. Paudel got her fifth goal of the game in the 78th after KC set her up.Rai scored her hat-trick in the 87th through a penalty after MSB Ahmed Ali handled the ball inside the area, and substitute Karki wrapped up a big victory a minute later converting a pass from Sabita.Nepal had a total of 35 shots at attempt—22 of them were on target—to the Maldives’ none.“Our first match was unexpected. The coach told us to play an attacking game and try to score more. Our objective was clear and I am happy that I was able to score,” player of the match Paudel said during the presentation. “It was a team effort. Thanks to my teammates,” she added.Nepal climbed to the top in the Group B standing on goal difference despite being level on four points with Bhutan, who thumped Sri Lanka 4-1 earlier on the day.Nepal take on Sri Lanka in their final group game on Thursday. Sri Lanka have three points and lie in the third position.The Maldives crashed out after two straight losses and will play for pride against Bhutan on Thursday.Tournament’s most successful side and five-time champions India and defending champions Bangladesh, who beat Nepal in the 2022 final to break India’s iron grip on SAFF throne last edition, are in Group B. India, who beat Pakistan 5-2 in their opening match, have already progressed into the last four. Bangladesh have one point after a damaging draw against Pakistan and face off against India in their last group game on Wednesday. \n A “severe cyclonic storm” pounded India’s eastern coast on Friday, uprooting trees, snapping power lines and inundating some areas, authorities said, adding that no deaths or injuries were reported.Cyclone Dana made landfall in Odisha state around midnight with wind speeds of 100-110 kmph (62-68 mph), gusting up to 120 kph (75 mph), but weakened into a cyclonic storm by forenoon, the weather department said.It is expected to weaken further into a deep depression in the afternoon.Odisha had closed schools, suspended flights to and from its capital city of Bhubaneswar until Friday morning, and evacuated more than half a million people in anticipation of the storm.“We don’t have any reports of damage to life or property, only damage to trees. Power in the affected area will be restored by late afternoon,” said Dilip Routrai, administrative chief of the region where the cyclone made landfall.Ports and industries in the state did not sustain any damage, he said.Paradip port, where work was suspended since Wednesday, had resumed normal operations, a senior port official told Reuters.By late Friday morning, people in several areas began returning to their homes from shelters.“We had tied our goats at home before we left for the shelter and returned to find that both they and our house were safe,” one resident told a local television channel.Heavy rainfall also lashed parts of the neighbouring state of West Bengal and, accompanied by a surge in the sea water, left low lying areas inundated, damaging the standing paddy crop that was almost ready for harvest in some fields.“Winter vegetables also perished in large agricultural tracts because of heavy rains and storm surge of the sea water that entered many areas in the Sunderbans belt,” said Bankim Hazra, minister for Sunderban Affairs.Flight operations resumed on Friday morning at the airports in Bhubaneswar and the West Bengal capital Kolkata, where too they were suspended since Thursday evening.Some of the 200 train services that were suspended also resumed operations.Severe storms pummel the coasts of India and neighbouring Bangladesh during the cyclone season from April to December each year, damaging both life and property.Odisha saw its worst cyclone in recent years in 1999, which raged for 30 hours and killed 10,000 people. \nIndonesia has emerged as a prime destination for artificial intelligence investment in Southeast Asia, driven by low electricity costs and supportive regulations, tech industry insiders say.The country is seen to harbor potential for hosting data centers and fostering AI applications, even though foundational AI infrastructure is expected to remain concentrated in more established tech hubs such as the United States and China.“I believe that, in terms of creating an infrastructure of AI, Southeast Asia is definitely not playing the game. The reason Malaysia and Indonesia are such hotspots for investment is because, among Asia, they have some of the lowest electricity costs,” said Esther Wong, founder and CEO of venture capital firm 3Cap, in a panel discussion at the Tech in Asia conference held in Jakarta on Wednesday.In addition to affordable energy, Wong highlighted that Indonesia was also appealing for its “very welcoming stance” on foreign direct investment.With its vast coastline, the country also had the ability to provide sustainable energy from sources such as tidal power, Wong pointed out, which could help reduce the energy burden of AI data centers.Tech giants have committed more than US$55 billion in investments to the region since 2023, according to Tech in Asia data as of July plus a more recent investment by Oracle in Malaysia.However, only $1.9 billion of that went to AI-related businesses in Indonesia, namely $1.7 billion from Microsoft and $200 million from Nvidia.The ability to provide low-cost energy for IT infrastructure such as data centers is critical for the development of AI and for running AI-based applications.Data centres consume significant amounts of energy for data processing and storage as well as for cooling systems, with AI applications being particularly demanding in terms of computing resources and therefore energy.However, the data centre industry previously said Indonesia’s electricity prices, ranging from 11 to 12 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh), were not competitive compared to Malaysia’s lower rate of 8 cents per kWh.Despite the region’s potential to attract investment in AI infrastructure, experts believe Southeast Asia will likely focus on developing practical AI software solutions rather than foundational AI models like those built in the US and China.Wesley Tay, principal at investment firm East Ventures, expressed confidence in the region’s ability to drive advancements in AI, particularly at the application level.Start-ups in the region are increasingly adopting open-source models and large language models (LLMs) to build solutions tailored to local needs, particularly in the software-as-a-service (SaaS) sector.“This application will then depend on the ability to gather the necessary data to train contextual data on top of open-source or closed-source models,” said Tay, underlining the role of data in differentiating AI solutions in Southeast Asia.Zia Zaman, general manager at Microsoft Ventures, the tech giant’s venture capital arm, echoed this view, suggesting the region’s AI development was likely to be more pragmatic and focused on profitability rather than research.He stressed the importance of looking beyond consumer-facing applications to how AI could empower businesses to operate more efficiently.“It will be practical; it will rise to profitability quicker, and it will likely ease [business-to-business operations],” Zaman said. “Don’t just think [business-to-consumer], guys. There’s so much more value in thinking about that community at home.”-In association with the Asia News Network \nThe United States does not want a protracted Israeli campaign in Lebanon, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Thursday, as efforts got underway to hold fresh talks over a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza.A month into Israel’s military onslaught against the Iranian-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah, Blinken said he hoped Iran was getting a clear message that any further attacks on Israel risked its own interests. Israel has vowed retaliation for an Iranian missile barrage on October 1.Israel’s military chief said an end to the conflict with Hezbollah looked possible but gave few details. Several Israeli strikes hit Beirut’s southern suburbs on Thursday evening, Reuters witnesses said.US and Israeli negotiators will gather in Doha to prepare for renewed talks on a Gaza ceasefire deal which would also entail release of hostages in the Palestinian enclave, Qatar and Washington said.Israel said its Mossad intelligence agency head David Barnea will travel to Doha on Sunday to try to restart talks, and meet with CIA director William Burns and Qatar’s prime minister.“The parties will discuss the various options for starting negotiations for the release of the hostages from Hamas captivity, against the backdrop of the latest developments,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said.An Egyptian security delegation met with a delegation of Hamas leaders in Cairo, part of efforts to resume the Gaza ceasefire negotiations, Egypt’s state-affiliated Al Qahera News TV said.Hamas senior official Osama Hamdan told Lebanese pro-Iranian TV channel Al Mayadeen there was no change in the group’s position. “The hostages held by the resistance will only return by stopping the aggression and completely withdrawing,” Hamdan said.Previous attempts to reach a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal have failed.Blinken, who held talks with Qatar’s prime minister, has been on his first trip to the region since Israel killed Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, a mastermind of the group’s October 7, 2023 attack on Israel that triggered conflict across the Middle East. Washington, Israel’s close ally, has expressed hope his death can provide an impetus for an end to the fighting.Israel unleashed its Lebanon offensive with the declared aim of securing the return of tens of thousands of people evacuated from homes in northern Israel during a year of cross-border hostilities with Hezbollah.Israel has used airstrikes to pound southern Lebanon, Beirut’s southern suburbs and the Bekaa Valley, and sent ground forces into areas near the border. Lebanese authorities say the campaign has killed more than 2,500 people and displaced more than 1 million people, spawning a humanitarian crisis.“As Israel conducts operations to remove the threat to Israel and its people along the border with Lebanon, we have been very clear that this cannot lead, should not lead, to a protracted campaign,” Blinken said in Doha.Blinken said the US was working on a diplomatic deal which would allow civilians on both sides on the border to return to their homes.Later, the head of Israel’s military said an end to the conflict with Hezbollah now looked possible.“In the north (of Israel), there’s a possibility of reaching a sharp conclusion. We thoroughly dismantled Hezbollah’s senior chain of command,” Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi said in a video statement.Blinken said Israel should take steps to avoid civilian casualties and not endanger UN peacekeepers or Lebanese army troops.Earlier on Thursday, an Israeli strike killed three Lebanese soldiers as they tried to evacuate wounded people from the border village of Yater, the Lebanese army said. There was no comment from the Israeli military.The Lebanese army’s deployment into the south, where Hezbollah holds sway, is seen as vital to any diplomatic resolution to the war.‘STORM’ OF DESTRUCTIONIn Paris, a conference convened by France raised $200 million for the Lebanese military and $800 million in humanitarian aid.“There needs to be a ceasefire in Lebanon. More damage, more victims, more strikes will not enable the end of terrorism or ensure security for everyone,” French President Emmanuel Macron said. He said the conference would support the recruitment of 6,000 Lebanese troops and provide the army with supplies.Lebanon’s caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati said a ceasefire was in Israel’s hands. “The storm we are currently witnessing...carries the seeds of total destruction, not only for our country, but for all human values,” he said.Israeli attacks on Thursday included a strike on a vehicle on a highway from Beirut to the Bekaa Valley - one of Lebanon’s busiest roads. A security source said one person was killed.The Israeli military said around 120 projectiles fired by Hezbollah had crossed into Israel.In northern Israel, air raid sirens sounded in Nahariya. Explosions could be heard as air defences fired to intercept rockets.At least 25 Israeli soldiers have been killed in southern Lebanon since the ground operation began three weeks ago. The Israeli military said on Thursday five more soldiers were killed and seven wounded there during combat.Hezbollah opened fire on Oct. 8, 2023, in solidarity with its Palestinian allies in Gaza. Israel’s Gaza offensive has killed nearly 43,000 people, according to Gaza authorities, and laid waste to the territory. The Hamas-led attack which sparked it killed 1,200 people and resulted in another 250 being abducted, according to Israeli tallies.At least 16 Palestinians were killed, including children, and 32 wounded in an Israeli strike on a school in Gaza’s Nuseirat camp, its Al-Awda hospital said.The Israeli military said it hit a Hamas command and control centre housed in a compound formerly used as a school in the Nuseirat area.Israel's military said on Thursday it had killed a Hamas commander, Mohammad Abu Itiwi, who took part in the October 7, 2023 assault on southern Israel and who also worked for UN aid agency UNRWA in the Gaza Strip. Israel has accused the agency of having many employees who double as members of Hamas and other armed groups. UNRWA had no immediate comment regarding the latest Israeli allegation. \nTropical Storm Trami has killed at least 26 people and forced more than 150,000 to flee their homes in the Philippines, officials said on Thursday, as it made landfall on the northeastern coast.Trami, locally known as severe tropical storm Kristine, dumped heavy to torrential rain on the main island of Luzon triggering widespread flooding and landslides.With maximum sustained winds of 95 kph, the storm was moving westward across the mountainous northern region of Cordillera towards the South China Sea, the state weather agency said in its 11 a.m. ( weather bulletin.It warned of heavy to intense rainfall, flooding, landslides and storm surges for some northern provinces.Most of the deaths from the storm over the past few days were due to drowning and landslides in the central Bicol region, including Naga City where 14 were reported dead on Thursday, officials said.Trami made landfall in the northeastern town of Divilacan in Isabela province. The town's disaster chief, Ezikiel Chavez, said no fatalities had been reported.The government ordered businesses and schools in the path of the storm to close in anticipation of heavy rain and floods.Over 163,000 people were sheltering in evacuation centres, the civil defence office said, most of whom were in Bicol as residents fled their homes after floodwaters reached as high as the roofs of bungalow houses.The civil aviation regulator said on Thursday at least a dozen flights across the country had been cancelled due to the storm.The central bank cancelled foreign exchange trading and monetary operations for a second straight day.The Philippines typically records an average of 20 tropical storms annually, often resulting in heavy rains, strong winds, and deadly landslides. \nChaaaiiittt…The spontaneous eruption of the sound of victory thundered through the neighbourhood of Nhyokha in the Kathmandu core. The line of a kite cut another. Looking out the window of her house, Sajani Shrestha saw children running full speed, shouting and fighting as they vied to catch the falling kite and thread. And craning her neck up to the sky, she could not count but only be mesmerised by the innumerable kites strewn across the skies of Nhyokha, Bangemudha, Indrachowk. “There would be so many kites that they entirely covered the blue of the sky, making beautiful patterns of different colours,” says the 51-year-old. “And you cannot imagine the number of times the call of chait rang in the air.”Clear blue sky and gentle westerlies, the season of kites has arrived in the Kathmandu Valley. While kites soared Kathmandu's sky mainly during Dashain, the kite season officially started in Nag Panchami (August) and ended on the Haribodhini Ekadashi (November). And from royalities to commoners, young and old all flew kites from rooftops and open grounds. Even those who did not, like Sajani, revelled in the live spectacle in the sky as kites soared and fought. With Bhimsen Thapa’s help, King Girvanyuddha flies kites The earliest written account of kite flying is believed to date to 200 BC in China. In Kathmandu, this tradition has religious and socio-cultural and environmental significance, says Tina Manandhar, lecturer of Nepalese History, Culture and Archaeology at Tribhuvan University. According to her, it is believed that kites in Kathmandu skies carry a message to the god of rain Indra that the valley's farmers have had enough rain for their crops. That is why Kathmandu farmers scolded anyone flying kites before plantation season.In an article ‘Changako Utpati Ra Bikas’ published in Gorkhapatra in 1995, historian Rajesh Gautam points to the lack of written documents indicating the exact time when kite culture was introduced in Nepal. Exploring different opinions on kite's introduction to Nepal, he writes that “some have opined the possibility that the skill and tradition of kite flying might have entered Nepal through India.” Yet some others, he writes, state that kites “came to Nepal from Japan during the time of [Rana PM] Dev Shumsher.”He concludes that most likely this tradition was introduced by Malla-era Newar traders: “But since Nepal’s relationship with Tibet and China is very old and direct, kites might have entered Nepal through the Newar traders who were engaged in the trade. One can estimate that the kite was introduced to Nepal during the (mediaeval) Malla regime.”In Social History of Nepal, TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi write that there exists documented evidence of the kite flying from the early 19th century. The authors state that Sundarananda, a contemporary poet, has mentioned that the young king Girvanyuddha Bikram Shah (r.1799-1816), with the help of Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa, flew kites from the towering temple of Taleju Bhawani, Hanumandhoka. And when the king's kite cut the kites of the youngsters, they were located and rewarded with money.In Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Sardar Bhim Bahadur Pandey states that “During the month of Kartik [October-November] young and old all flew kites,” suggesting that kite culture was ubiquitous in Kathmandu by the early twentieth century.Anticipations and preparationsKite flying in Nepal requires a kite, a lattai (a wooden spool), thread and majha (homemade adhesive prepared by boiling snail slime, rice or sago, and powdered glass from burnt electric bulbs and coated on the line to sharpen it for kite fighting).77-year-old Nirmal Man Tuladhar, an avid kite flyer and retired professor of Linguistics at the Tribhuvan University, explains how Nepali tradition of kite flying was both expensive and needing advance preparation.“In our times, it wasn’t easy to fly kites,” he says. “We had to prepare majha …And as Nepali kites are fighter kites, we mainly fought with other kites [which meant we spent a lot of threads].”This preparation needed first and foremost of passing a hurdle: securing finances and materials to fly kites. While lattai was a one-time investment that could be saved for years, kites and threads had to be replenished every time a kite was cut.“Those were the times when parents wanted us to be more focused in our studies. They only gave money [to buy kites] after immense pestering,” says 80-year-old Dwarika Nath Dhungel, former Secretary of Nepal government, speaking of the 1950s and 1960s.Biodiversity specialist and botanist Tirtha Bahadur Shrestha, 86, was born in Mahabouddha and began flying kites from 1951-52. He saved what little money he got for afternoon snacks to buy Hattimar reel, a brand of line wound in a small lattai, which was strong and sharp and where majha stuck well.Raghuji Pant, a member of parliament, also recalls the difficulty in securing money to sustain his kite flying in and around Kathmandu core in the 1960s and early 1970s. “Four to five of my kites were cut in a day,” writes the 67-year-old in his 2019 article “Changa Jastai Udi Hidne Man” published in Himalkhabar. “[This caused] the line in the spool to shorten. From Bhadra [August-September] to one to one and a half months after Dashain I spent flying kites. So, it was difficult for me to have enough kites even after getting money from grandfather, grandmother, mother and everyone.”Kites and thread secured, now began the crucial work of preparing and applying majha whose strength determined how well it cut other kites. Govinda Tandon, 70, a historian and heritage expert, who grew up in Battisputali, was also an ardent kite flyer.“Materials for making majha were prepared right from the morning on a holiday,\" he writes in his article “Dashainko Butte Changa” published in Gorkhapatra. “Because this work couldn’t be accomplished without a collaboration of 3-4 friends, a holiday was set aside for this. Moreover, a sunny day was considered appropriate. If the majha didn’t dry, the thread could turn moist, and so if it felt like the day wouldn’t be sunny, the entire plan…was aborted.”Kite makers, kite sellers and variety of kites One of the oldest shops in Kathmandu's memory, Shree Chitrakar Kite Center in Tyauda, Asan is bustling with customers during Dashain. “When my grandmother got married and came to this house at age 12 [in early 1940s], this shop was already here,” says its fourth generation owner 47-year-old Dinoj Chitrakar. “So the shop must be around a hundred years old.”Another shop that stands out in Kathmandu's memory is Manandhar Kite Center in Kalimati, established in 1949, and currently run by brothers Mohan Man and Sundar Man Manandhar.In his book Antar Taranga, artist and writer Manuj Babu Mishra recalls “a kite shop near the old halwai shop of Chabahil” in the 1940s. Dhungel and his 1960 batchmates of Juddhodaya Public School recall the kite shops from the 1950s and 1960s – Bekhacha’s Shop at Netapacho, Bhaicha’s Shop at Nhyokha, Lata Manandhar’s Shop at Maru, Kanchha Buddha Bajracharya Shop at Tyauda.Besides the shops, there were makers and sellers of kites cloistered in different localities of Kathmandu Valley.In Kwalkhu, Patan was a Joshi who made Nepali paper kites.“One day I accompanied my uncle to buy kites,\" writes Dibya Giri, 69, in his 2023 article “Changa” in Sahitya Post. “I was amazed to see the huge stacks of kites there. We used to call it the house of the kite maker.”In Nhyokha, Purna Bahadur Shrestha began making kites as a teenager and started his own kite business in the 1950s, according to his daughter Sajani.These kites, made out of Nepali paper, often had different paintings. Mishra recalls painting kites for the kite shop in Chabahil.“I went to that kite shop and with the freely available colours and Nepali papers, I spent my day painting faces, birds, animals, masks, mountains, hills, whatever came to my mind,” he writes in the book. “Such kites apparently sold well!”Most septuagenarians and older generations like Tuladhar and Tirtha Bahadur recall flying kites made of Nepali paper when young. Tirtha Bahadur says that kites from Lucknow began coming to Kathmandu only after the late 1950s. But at least a section of Kathmandu was flying kites from Lucknow from the early twentieth century. Vaidya, Manandhar and Joshi write that the Ranas and Shahs imported kites from Lucknow and that from them, their favourite employees also got to fly some. These kites were large and, in Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Pande writes that they were referred to as Lucknowia kites.Known for their characteristic hissing sound they made while flying, light body, swift movement and ability to take sharp turns, Lucknow kites were preferred by kite fighters.“Lucknow kites were lighter and could be manoeuvred well,” says Tuladhar. “Kites of Nepali paper were stable but difficult to manoeuvre. They were also expensive. So only some fighters flew Nepali paper kites.”The kites had different names depending upon their designs and colours – Ambe (a heart in the centre), Dibdibe (chequered), Pakhete (a different coloured paper on one edge), Sete (white-coloured), Nilchi (blue-coloured), Rate (red-coloured) and so on.The kite fighters preferred the strong and sharp Hattimar reel that came on a small lattai. The Belchamar reel was cheaper but weaker and prone to be cut by other threads. Kite fliers and kite watchers on rooftops and open groundsBibek Shrestha, 57, and his two brothers took stacks of kites and climbed their rooftops. The rooftops around theirs in the neighbourhood of Nhyokha – in fact in all core settlements of the Valley – were filled with kite fliers and spectators. Many risked precariously balancing on the sloped roofs.While Bibek and his brothers’ kites alighted to meet the sea of kites in the sky, their sister Sajani and other family members gathered around to revel in the live spectacle.Dhungel remembers the rooftops of Jhochhen and surroundings of the 1950s and 1960s swelled with kite fliers. Dhungel did try to fly kites. But he did not become a successful kite flyer. What he did become was, like Sajani and many Kathmandu residents, an admirer of kites soaring in the sky.“But more than engaging in my unsuccessful kite flying attempts, I enjoyed looking at the kites flying. There would be a big crowd of spectators. Females and other family members watched the kites fly as they ate meat and chiura. Some even drank and rejoiced as they flew kites.”When the age of cassette player and speakers dawned in the 1980s, songs blared from the speakers alongside kite flying. Chitrakar and Bibek invited their friends, put their favourite songs on speakers and spent entire afternoons flying kites, dancing, singing and eating.Away from the core cities, in the villages in the Valley, people flew kites in open fields. Like Dibya, who set his kite for flight from the banks of Godavari River in Tikathali. Chhauni was also a popular space for flying kites.Kathmandu’s joy in kite fightingBibek pulled his kite down and then manoeuvred it back up so his line touched his opponent's line from below and quickly reeled out his line. The resulting sharpness from the speed cut the opponent's line.Chaaaiiitttt………“The greatest fun comes from cutting another kite's string,” writes Tuladhar in his 1996 article “Cutting is the greatest fun” published in magazine Kite Lines. “With its coating of adhesive paste and ground glass, the string is as sharp and abrasive as sandpaper on your opponent's line.”Nepali kite, Tuladhar says, is made to fight other kites, and describes how a kite line cuts the other.“The technique is to touch your rival's string and immediately reel out line at high speed,” he writes. “The Nepalese style of kite flying is aggressive, and though the kites look simple, they are strategically designed for bringing down other kites.”At any given time, like Bibek’s kite above Nhyokha sky, skies above the Valley were filled with raging kites, swinging, coming down and going up as the fighters reeled in and out their lattais in ferocious attempts to bring down other kites.Meanwhile spectators cheered. “Even passersby stopped to look at the kites,” recalls Tina.The moment of a kite cutting was accompanied by the sound of chait, and children ran in the direction of the falling kite to grab it and the thread in what was termed as, Dibya says, changa lutne/dhago lutne.Dhungel always joined in to shout the chait resounding through the locality of Jhochhen and almost automatically his feet sped towards the severed kites' direction.“‘Oii leave that thread,’ the kite owner would scold me. ‘Why do you pull my thread, leave it right now.’ But I’d continue pulling the threads as the owner continued shouting. Other times I caught the kites that had failed to fly and dropped on the ground.”The fallen kites got stuck in the buildings, trees or poles, or glided down in the open grounds or paddy fields. Falling kites from the Kathmandu core settled down in Tundikhel covering it. Oftentimes kites fell on the fields to rest upon the lush paddy nearing its harvest.“Children ran straight into the fields to catch the kite,” says Dibya. \"They destroyed the crops by stepping on them. Some farmers chased them, scolding along as they did so and if they caught anyone, they slapped them.”Love and restrictions on kiteAmidst the raging kite fights high up in the sky, there were apparently also some quieter kites lingering much lower among the buildings or tree lines, for their goals lay in not ruthlessly cutting the threads of other kites but piercing softly through the hearts of their owners' love interests. During the Rana regime, there were designated public spaces to fly kites, writes Gautam in his article. Referring to oral accounts, he writes that the Ranas were particularly careful to avoid kite flyers around their durbars. This is because love-stricken men tied letters to kites and flew them into the durbars to their love interests among the nanis.He writes that the kites could be flown mainly on the grounds of Chhauni. Anyone flying kites in any other place and around Rana durbars were arrested.Pant also recalls love-stricken boys from his time. “Just as kites came in different colours and patterns, so did kite flyers,” he writes in the article. “Some wrote love letters using a few words in “symbolic language” on a plain kite and attempted to land it on the rooftop of the girl they liked. Some simply landed their kites on any rooftop if a girl appeared there and waited for reaction.”King Tribhuvan among kite fliersPande writes in his book: “Once or twice during kite season every year, King Tribhuvan went to Chhauni to fly kites. Legend has it that if the line of the king’s kite was cut, it flew to Lhasa. But since anyone who caught that kite received five rupees, everyone attempted to catch that kite.”In 2021 news report ‘Bhawanle Chhekidiyo Changa Udaune Aakash’ by Shivahari Ghimire published in Nayapatrika, cultural expert the late Satyamohan Joshi also recounts that “During Dashain, Tribhuvan came to the ground below Swayambhu to fly kites. […] He did not use the same thread to fly kites twice.”In the same article, Joshi says that the King also went to Budhanilakantha to fly kites and participate in kite flying competitions.End of season, end of cultureMohan Krishna Shrestha, 86, was born in Budhanilakantha. Every year, on the day of Haribodhini Ekadashi, he saw the annual fair at the Budhanilakantha Temple. He also witnessed kite fliers gathered in the open fields around the Temple.“Oh, it’d be a lot of people,” says Shrestha. “They came from all around Bhaktapur, Kathmandu and Lalitpur.”They flew kites on Ekadashi, Dwadashi and some even until Purnima.“They took all the remaining threads and kites that had survived Dashain and flew the last kites of the season,” says Tuladhar. “I remember my uncles, relatives and neighbours going to Budhanilakantha with their kites.”Joshi recalls in the 2021 article that King Tribhuvan also went to Budhanilakantha with his sons Mahendra, Himalaya and Basundhara. He greatly supported and also participated in the competitions there organised by the commoners. If he liked he gave prize money to the winners.This annual event lost its glory days after the decline in the open fields as buildings began to rise with the establishment of Budhanilkantha School in 1972, Mohan says.“The event survived in some form until the 1990s,” he says.But what happened after that?The end-of-the-season event in the 1990s was also an indication of the end of the age-old kite tradition.“If I go to my ancestral place in Asan to fly kites, it’s not possible for me to do that today because there are buildings everywhere,” says Tuladhar. “Cityscapes and urbanisation have created the obstacle for flying kites.”Dibya does feel like flying kites sometimes.“No space to fly kites today,” he says. “In the old times, there were river banks and open fields. Even if you fly kites, it gets stuck in somebody's rooftop or water tank or somewhere.”Yesteryear’s kite enthusiasts believe that increasing means of entertainment was another reason for the decline of kite culture.“When television came, kite flying started to slowly decrease,” says Bibek. “And then mobile phones robbed kite flying even more.”And so, when his sister Sajani cranes her neck up in the sky today, she rarely sees a kite.“Those days we heard one chait after another,” she says. “These days you won’t hear a single chait.” \nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nWhat animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. \nNepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) \nThe 23rd meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Council Heads of Government was held in Islamabad (Pakistan) on October 15-16, 2024. This meeting is important as countries constantly align and realign their interests, trying all opportunities to cooperate while avoiding strategic entanglement in great power rivalry. The SCO, which emerged and entered into force in 2003 in the post-Soviet space, has expanded over time. Originally mooted by China and Russia to counter Western strategic influence in the Central Asia and Eurasian region, it was designed as a geo-strategic organisation to succeed the Shanghai Five formed in 1996. Its focus was on countering the ‘three evils’—terrorism, extremism and separatism. The organisation later expanded, including India and Pakistan as its members in 2017. It is now a regionally anchored multifaceted cooperation with a 10-member organisation responsible for playing a key role as regional multilateralism becomes the norm in international politics. There are three observer countries and 14 dialogue partners, including Nepal and Sri Lanka. India has strongly advocated ‘reformed multilateralism’ and has longstandingly advocated UN Security Council reform. It also emphasises that member states must demonstrate commitment to the SCO Charter rather than cherry-picking issues.Enhancing economic cooperationInitially, the organisation focused on economic cooperation and established transport linkages to bolster trade and economic ties. Except for India, all other member states are part of China’s ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). India continues to emphasise that any transport corridor requires respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty. China’s economic push to the Central Asian Region, at times, has made the Russians uncomfortable. However, given the dynamics of the West, mainly the United States’ approach to both Russia and China, which is believed to be a containment strategy, has brought the two countries closer in the strategic realm. In this context, the SCO is seen as a vehicle for expanding economic relations with an underlying strategic content. India, which has a deeper economic interest, is also concerned about terrorism and extremism that branches out of this geo-political space. It can potentially destabilise India’s efforts to advance the ‘Connect Central Asia policy’ of 2012 and the proposed International North South Transport Corridor (INSCTC) to connect to the larger Eurasian region. India’s access to Central Asia has been through Iran, where it has invested in the Chahbahar Port, a strategic gateway to enhance its economic engagement with the Eurasian region.According to media reports, the SCO countries possess “25 percent of the world's oil reserves, over 50 percent of the world's gas reserves, 35 percent of the world's coal reserves, and roughly 50 percent of the world's known uranium reserves”. India has emphasised collaborative connectivity, which includes industrial cooperation to enhance competitiveness and expand labour markets, micro, small and medium enterprises collaboration and access to affordable pharmaceutical capabilities. Though Pakistan emphasised the ‘SCO connectivity framework’ in the recent summit, it has remained a major stumbling block in allowing India overland connectivity to Central Asia and Afghanistan through Pakistan due to geopolitics and regional rivalry.Evolving strategic spaceThe emergence of the Central Asian Republic for the first time provided the US with a window of opportunity to expand its geo-strategic influence over this region. However, Russia was extremely careful in nurturing its geo-strategic space. It did not want the Central Asian Republics to emerge as a challenge to Russia’s hegemonic presence and influence in the region. The Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) emerged as a forum to have a coordinated effort to deal with security challenges confronting the region. Nonetheless, Russia’s war with Ukraine has limited its ability to come to the rescue of other countries in the region, especially Armenia, in its border conflict with Azerbaijan. This has provided Beijing with an opportunity to step up security cooperation. In May 2023, it convened the first China-Central Asia summit in Xi'an to cooperate on security matters.The United States’ exit from Afghanistan allowed the SCO to emerge as an effective regional player. It has a Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure (RATS), SCO-led military exercises, a SCO Contact Group for Afghanistan and Cooperation on combatting drug trafficking. Afghanistan remains a major security concern for the SCO members, and RATS has been at the forefront of combating such security challenges. Several terrorist and extremist groups operating out of Afghanistan pose a threat to the internal stability of the member countries, given the international terror network that has spawned to carry out attacks. International terrorist groups like Islamic State Khorasan (ISIS-K), Daish and al-Qaeda are entrenching their base in Afghanistan, which is believed to be under the patronage of the Taliban. Yet, the SCO has a cautious approach to Afghanistan. Some countries have preferred to engage the Taliban to deal with terror threats. The recent attacks in Moscow and Pakistan illustrate why engaging Afghanistan is important for some member states. Anti-terrorism Interaction-2024 joint exercise of the SCO member states held in Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region also demonstrates the growing threat of terrorism.Relevance of the SCOAnalysts have often differed on the relevance of the SCO from the member-country’s perspectives. In the post-Cold War period, such regional multilateral organisations mushroomed and were seen as forums to advance collective interest. The SCO needs to be taken into account in the larger geopolitical context. The competitive interests of member countries certainly hinder the potential of any multilateral organisations, as there is a balancing game when granting membership to certain countries. However, it is important to recognise the relevance of such organisations, especially in combatting transnational crime. The SCO’s relevance as a Eurasian organisation is poised to further its economic interest through its connectivity projects and collaboration among private corporate players by providing a conducive environment to invest while dealing with larger security issues arising from terrorism threats. The organisation would remain relevant as a geopolitical and geo-economic vehicle to allow member states to pursue their common interests in an era of strategic flux. \nNepal experiences nearly 80 percent of its total annual precipitation during the monsoon season, which normally spans from June to September. The monsoon is a double-edged sword for the country, bringing blessings and hardships. On the positive side, the rains sustain agriculture, replenish vital water resources and support the livelihoods of millions in rural areas. However, the same torrential rains also unleash destructive floods and landslides, causing significant damage to life, property and infrastructure. The situation is often exacerbated by human-induced factors, such as unplanned urbanisation, deforestation and poorly managed infrastructure development, which obstruct the natural water flow and worsen the impact of monsoon-related disasters.In 2024, Nepal experienced record-breaking rainfall in September, surpassing a 50-year precedent. The heavy rains triggered severe floods and landslides across the country, with 26 of Nepal's 77 districts being severely affected. In response to the scale of the devastation, the government declared these districts disaster crisis zones, allowing for a faster mobilisation of resources and relief efforts. The floods damaged roads, destroyed bridges, disrupted drinking water supplies and crippled telecommunications networks, leaving thousands of people stranded and vulnerable. Moreover, 16 hydropower plants, responsible for generating 667.9 MW of electricity, were severely damaged, along with key transmission lines, further crippling Nepal's already fragile energy sector.The human toll of the disaster was profound. A total of 244 lives were lost, 19 people were reported missing, and 179 others were injured. Over 17,774 individuals were rescued by government and security forces, including the Nepal Army, Armed Police Force and local volunteers. Despite their efforts, relief distribution was slow, leaving many families waiting for essential assistance. The government pledged Rs200,000 in compensation to families who had lost loved ones, and financial support was directed to local units for disaster management. However, the sheer scale of the disaster overwhelmed the government's capacity to respond effectively.The economic consequences of the disaster were equally devastating. The estimated financial losses exceeded Rs17 billion, with damage of Rs6 billion in the agriculture sector alone. As agriculture is the backbone of Nepal’s rural economy, the disruption is expected to increase food imports, further widening the country's trade deficit. The energy sector, already under strain, suffered Rs4 billion worth of damages, which will likely force Nepal to import electricity from India to compensate for the loss in hydropower production. Additionally, tourism, another vital sector of the economy, was negatively impacted, and the increased budgetary pressure on the government will worsen an already delicate fiscal situation.As a result of the disaster, Nepal’s GDP is projected to contract by 1 percent, representing a loss of Rs57 billion. This will also reduce the country’s economic growth rate, which was previously estimated at 4.9 percent by the Asian Development Bank. With the increased debt obligations and a growing trade deficit, Nepal's economic outlook remains precarious.The international community responded swiftly to Nepal’s crisis. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed solidarity with Nepal, assuring that India would stand by Nepal in its time of need and offer all possible cooperation to help overcome the disaster. India, Nepal’s immediate neighbour, quickly dispatched essential supplies, including medicines, food, hygiene products and emergency equipment. India's significant role in Nepal’s disaster management has been recognised globally, particularly for its assistance during the 2015 and 2023 earthquakes in Jajarkot. China also expressed condolences for the human casualties and property losses caused by the disaster. Additionally, China provided emergency supplies, including blankets, rice, and other essential goods for those affected. Other countries, such as the United Kingdom and Russia, also expressed their grief. Beyond bilateral support, international organisations also played a critical role in disaster relief efforts. The World Bank approved $150 million in emergency funding to support victims affected by the floods and landslides. Numerous other donor agencies and countries offered financial aid, highlighting the global concern for Nepal’s plight.However, the disaster emphasised significant weaknesses in Nepal’s disaster preparedness. The damage was intensified by inadequate infrastructure and unregulated construction in vulnerable areas. The government’s short-term rescue and relief efforts weren’t that effective, and long-term planning to address disaster risk reduction remains largely underdeveloped.Monsoon-induced disasters are not a new challenge for Nepal; however, climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of such events. The 2024 floods underscore the urgent need for comprehensive disaster management policies that prioritise disaster preparedness, sustainable urban development, and environmental conservation.Moving forward, the Nepali government must focus on several critical areas. First, enhancing early warning systems is essential to ensure communities receive timely information about potential floods and landslides. Second, investing in flood management infrastructure—such as embankments, retention basins and better drainage systems—helps mitigate the effects of heavy rainfall. Third, construction activities should be regulated in flood-prone areas to prevent the uncontrolled development that often leads to increased disaster vulnerability.Additionally, Nepal must also focus on sustainable land-use practices. Reforestation initiatives and the promotion of sustainable agriculture can help restore ecosystems and reduce the risk of landslides while also improving the resilience of rural communities to future monsoon-induced disasters. Furthermore, long-term collaboration with international donors and organisations will be critical in rebuilding stronger and more resilient communities.Nepal can draw valuable lessons from past mistakes to inform proactive measures for the future. Prioritising disaster risk reduction and investing in sustainable development, Nepal can better prepare for the monsoon season and ensure that rainfall’s benefits are maximised while minimising the devastating consequences of floods and landslides. \nTorrential rains in the last week of September caused devastation in many parts of the country. The death toll of the calamity crossed 200, thousands have been homeless, and the damage it has inflicted upon the national economy is still to be fully assessed. When disasters strike Nepal, the presence of the government in rescue and relief operations is usually symbolic: An earthmoving equipment here, an army unit there, or a team of bewildered police personnel at some places trying to cope with emergencies that they are neither trained nor equipped to handle. In a coping mechanism that is charitably called “the resilience of Nepali people”, the affected population is often back on its feet through individual efforts. Even though somewhat muted, the Hindu novena of Dashain was celebrated, and the preparations for the five-day-long Tihar festivities have already begun. Several squatters managed to reassemble their damaged shanties themselves in the floodplains soon after the rains subsided. Houses submerged due to overflowing drains in low-lying localities have been cleaned up through individual and community efforts. But in a testament to the apathy of all three tiers of the republican order in the country, debris deposited by floods continue to decompose in the riverbed, and plastic waste lifted by torrents still flutter like flags from branches of trees and lamp posts all along the Bagmati Corridor. Had the federal government considered it an emergency, an army team would have been deployed to clear the garbage from roads along the riverbed in the Kathmandu Valley within few days. The provincial government of Bagmati needed no new laws to show its presence during a calamity—even a symbolic act of the chief minister working with a shovel would have conveyed an uplifting message. Shamed into action, the Lalitpur metropolitan government has called upon its citizens to volunteer for the clean-up drive. It’s still not too late for the celebrity Mayor Balendra Shah to follow the lead of his senior colleague.Cultural rootsDespite loud claims to the contrary, almost all religions with their “packaged superstitions”—including political religions such as communism and free-market fundamentalism—are regressive, and Hinduism is no exception. With an established tradition of karma, vacuous pride in traditions and institutionalised inequality of caste hierarchy, it is harder for a republican order to take root in societies where the Sanatan Dharma is the dogma. If Hindu monarchs of the past were avatars of Vishnu, elected leaders seem to get away with characterisations such as “Durga astride a tiger” or a human being “not born biologically”. One doesn’t question a divine being even when the person must acquire political legitimacy through the popular mandate of lesser mortals. The transactional relationships of patronage and support between politicians and their followers aren’t uncommon, but the unquestioned loyalty of the herd to its shepherd perhaps owes its origin to the tribal instinct and religious beliefs extant in many societies.It seems the citizenry in Nepal get so little from their government and yet don’t complain because they have been conditioned to demand nothing from the representatives other than some personal favours in lieu of allegiance—an appointment, a contract or some assistance in favourably resolving a dispute—once in a while. Let alone integrity, even civility and decency are seldom expected from politicos who exercise control over the resources and instruments of the state. When the citizenry is apathetic, Premier Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli can easily get away with a questionable largesse from an oligarch under investigation to build the headquarters of the ruling party. Despite his past entanglements—OMNI scandal, links with Yeti Group, Giri Bandhu land swap case, profligate actions and outrageous outbursts—Sharma Oli remains the unquestioned supremo of the CPN-UML and an idolised chieftain of the Khas-Arya ethnonationalists across party lines.Former Deputy Prime Minister and Chair of Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), Rabi Lamichhane, has been arrested and remanded into custody for further investigations of serious charges on judicial orders. The Supreme Court had once removed him from the office of the deputy prime minister and ousted him from the membership of the parliament for violating citizenship laws. In any other country, it would have meant the end of a political career, but in the land of “Never ending peace and love” that is Nepal, Lamichhane continues to command the fierce loyalty of White Shirts and “People Like Us” (PLUs) of the urban middle class.In a society where piety is more prevalent than virtue and rituals are more valued than rationality, it’s extremely difficult to institutionalise republican principles of liberty, equality, fraternity and secularity. No wonder followers blindly line up in support of their petty, populist and ‘elected monarchs’ such as Sharma Oli, Lamichhane, Shah, or even the Mayor of Dharan sub-metropolitan city Harka Sampang. In a deeply rooted culture of piety and fealty, a political manipulator can get away with anything as long as he—leadership is a male bastion—manages to dupe the flock with his bluster and bombast.Economic compulsionsHardcore adherents of republicanism may disagree, but just as authoritarianism is intrinsic to monarchism, financial improprieties are integral to almost all electoral systems that reward their winners with enormous authority to disburse concessions and distribute freebies to oligarchs who have funded their rise to power. Legal theorist Camila Vergara recognises the “systemic corruption” and argues that grassroot assemblies independent of political parties and representative government can help establish an “anti-oligarchic republic” of plebians. However, it’s not unusual for uncanny oligarchs to exploit grassroots movements.It was argued that the Tea Party movement morphed into Trumpism with Trump agreeing that it “still exists — except now it’s called Make America Great Again.” Even though Arvind Kejriwal was the direct beneficiary of Anna Hazare’s India Against Corruption (IAC) campaign of the PLUs in India, it also prepared the ground for the phenomenal spread of Hindutva politics. There is undoubtedly some merit in Ram Manohar Lohia’s roar in Hindi, “Agar sadkein khamosh ho jayein tau Sansad awaara ho jati hai (If the streets fall silent, the Parliament goes berserk)”. But irrespective of its plebian, oligarchic or liberal antecedents, all republics have to ultimately go to the polls to acquire or renew their legitimacy. Civic movements are necessary but not sufficient for the functioning of a republic.No matter how well designed an electoral system is, polls are always skewed in favour of political parties with competitively large purses. The temptation of fresh entrants into the electoral fray to fall for dubious domestic or foreign contributions is thus understandable even if not acceptable. There is no easy treatment for the endemic disease of democratic systems, but perhaps institutionalisation through broadening of the support base and continuous correction of political parties can help alleviate painful symptoms.Building a sustainable and responsible political party is a work of generations that requires an ideological commitment of organisers and supporters alike. When people pay, parties will be forced to become accountable. Premier Sharma Oli’s alleged plans to ease party splits through an ordinance are not just shortsighted but downright dangerous. Ambitious politicos need to discard their privileges if they wish to build new platforms for themselves.  \nChildren of all ages have mobile phones in their hands these days. Many of them learn about alphabets or numbers even before enrolling in schools. Although the internet offers avenues for children’s development, things can quickly go awry online. In the digital landscape, children are regularly exposed to things that aren’t accessible in real life. While children are more tech-savvy than ever, there is a glaring lack of awareness on the potential dangers of the virtual world. According to a report by The Guardian, each year, more than 300 million children worldwide become victims of online sexual exploitation and abuse. In Nepal, in under two months of the fiscal year 2024-2025, the Cyber Bureau recorded 68 cybercrime cases involving children. It logged 635 cases in the previous fiscal year, 2023-24—a 260.8 percent rise from the 176 cases in the fiscal year 2022-23. This is concerning for a nation where per capita internet usage is greater than in some developed nations even as its digital literacy rates are low. Many Nepali parents do not hesitate to give their devices to their children to keep them engaged. This practice is hardly shocking in a country where most parents themselves are digitally illiterate. This exposes the children to harmful online spaces at a very young age. Children are naturally curious and seek validation, so people easily manipulate them online. Predators groom them into sharing nudes and personal information and even meeting in real life. The offences can turn into blackmail and threats or sextortion, where abusers demand money from the victim to keep images private, scarring the children for life. Usually, the number of crime reports does not reflect the reality as many children keep it to themselves and suffer silently. These days, children are often more comfortable making friends online than in real life. There are ample online dating and chatting sites, gaming apps and social media platforms where one can communicate with strangers. In many cases, online sexual abuse culminates in real-life sexual violence. According to a Post report, a 13-year-old girl was sexually abused online and later raped by a 20-year-old man whom she met through an online gaming app, FreeFire. With the rise of Artificial Intelligence, child sexual exploitation online is taking new heights with deepfake and other generative AI content. According to the Internet Watch Foundation, the amount of AI-made illegal content related to child sexual abuse over the past six months has already exceeded the previous year’s total. Moreover, it also states how the dark web isn’t the only problem, as almost all the content found was on publicly available areas online. While Nepal has implemented laws to combat online child abuse, these regulations are nowhere near enough to oversee the rapidly evolving technologies. The Electronic Transactions Act 2008 does not explicitly address online child sexual abuse. Moreover, the Act Relating to Children 2018 fails to define child pornography, grooming, sextortion or cyberstalking, which are recurring activities involved in online child sexual abuse. The Ministry of Women, Citizens and Senior Citizens in 2021 approved the Online Child Protection Procedure in 2021, where restricting children’s access to harmful content online was stated as the duty of internet service providers; however, that hasn’t been effective. This is why it is vital that our legal mechanisms are strengthened and simple and accessible child-friendly online safety resources created. Additionally, it is imperative to spread awareness of online abuse and sexual exploitation through school curriculums. As children are exposed to online risks, even within the comfort of their homes, parents must realise that safeguarding them in the physical world is not enough. \nFlight delays lasting hours or even days have become the unfortunate norm for anyone flying with an aircraft of the Nepal Airlines Corporation (NAC), the country’s national flag carrier. On Saturday, for instance, its ‘Sagarmatha’ narrow-body aircraft flew from Delhi after a 19-hour delay due to oil filter issues, while the ‘Lumbini’ experienced a three-hour delay after its computer system malfunctioned en route to Dubai. Meanwhile, the wide-body ‘Annapurna’ has been grounded at the Tribhuvan International Airport since last Thursday due to engine trouble, while another wide-body, ‘Makalu’, is undergoing maintenance in Italy. These incidents have left countless passengers stranded at airports, both at home and abroad.Technical disruptions are nothing new to Nepal Airlines, but these recent problems have compounded the carrier’s woes. Such failures have inconvenienced passengers, raised concerns about their safety, tarnished the corporation’s image and burdened it with huge losses. For instance, a high-profit route like Kathmandu-Narita (Japan) has been disrupted, which would otherwise have brought in around Rs20 million for the airlines on normal days. Moreover, due to the grounding of the Makalu aircraft in Italy, the airlines is losing Rs20 million daily in its business. It also has the added burden of accommodating passengers whose flights were delayed and whose tickets to connecting flights had to be rebooked at exorbitant prices. If this state of affairs continues, it is only a matter of time before the inevitable question arises: Why do we need this white elephant of an organisation? The problems don’t end with technical issues. As concerning is the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal’s (CAAN) dereliction of duty, which has pushed Nepal further back on the EU Air Safety List. Nepal’s airlines don’t meet international safety standards and are therefore barred from European skies. The European Council’s long-standing concern has been over the CAAN’s failure to “enhance the safety of flyers”. Nepal’s civil aviation body still plays the dual roles of regulator and service provider. Lack of safety is bad for business too. Aviation experts say safety concerns are one reason Australia is yet to approve the landing of Nepali carriers on its soil. Again, if the airlines cannot reliably operate on these potentially lucrative routes, what is the point of having an international airliner operator? The UN’s International Civil Aviation Organisation and other aviation watchdogs have called for a complete overhaul of CAAN, recommending that it be split into two entities. Political manoeuvring, however, is halting the passage of the CAAN reform bill that is currently stuck in Parliament. Meanwhile, the top management of Nepal Airlines is engaged in an endless blame-game of who is responsible for its sorry plight. It seems like our government stakeholders in aviation are simply uninterested in having safe skies or in increasing the quality of service of our national flag carrier. Nepal Airlines came into operation in 1958, two years before Thai Airways. The former is barely functional with a juddering fleet of six while the latter is thriving with a fleet-footed fleet of 79. This might not be an exact comparison. What we can say with more certainty is that for a remittance- and tourism-dependent economy, the path Nepal Airlines is charting leads to a dead end.  \nGiven the mountain of evidence piled up by the special parliamentary probe committee to establish his involvement in the misappropriation of funds of various cooperatives, the arrest of Rabi Lamichhane, the Rastriya Swatantra Party chief and former deputy prime minister and home minister, was inevitable. Misusing the funds of hundreds of thousands of poor depositors, most of whom occupy the lowest rungs of the national economic ladder, is the most dastardly crime. We thus hope that those named by the committee, including Lamichhane, are brought to book. But that is not enough. Following Lamichhane’s arrest, his supporters have been blaming the government of being motivated by personal vendetta against the RSP chair. As evidence, they point to Nepali Congress vice-president Dhanaraj Gurung and CPN-UML federal lawmaker Rishikesh Pokharel, who, they allege, are being let off the hook despite their involvement in similar scandals.Gurung is accused of abetting the misappropriation of funds from a Lalitpur-based cooperative. He reportedly helped his ex-wife, Joyti Gurung, embezzle around Rs12.5 million. Similarly, there are accusations that Pokharel, the CPN-UML leader who is also the chair of Parliament’s Public Accounts Committee, helped his wife, Anjala Koirala, embezzle as much as Rs120 million from a Morang-based cooperative. Apparently, the Congress-UML government is using all its power to save them from prosecution. Whether that is the case, these critics of the government do have a point. To show that the government machinery is not targeting a single person or party, the allegations against the top Congress and UML leaders should also be thoroughly investigated and the respective parties must help with such probes. The larger goal here is not only to punish particular people like Lamichhane or GB Rai, Lamichhane’s partner-in-crime at Galaxy 4k TV run by the Gorkha Media Network. It is rather to clean up the cooperative sector, one of the three pillars of the national economy. Moreover, the prosecution of Lamichhane will seem credible only if there is also an impartial investigation of the allegations against top leaders affiliated with the ruling coalition. Thankfully, at least in Gurung’s case, the Central Investigation Bureau of the Nepal Police is already looking into his involvement in the Lalitpur-based cooperative. But what is the Congress doing on the matter? In the case of Pokharel, it would be wise of the UML to conduct an internal investigation. The law enforcement agencies can then take over. Such an initiative of the prime minister’s party would buttress the public image of both the UML and the country’s executive head. Given the widespread cynicism with the state machinery, it has become vital to restore some public faith in it. That is difficult when the prime minister himself accepts gargantuan donations to establish a party office. Such gestures signal that PM Oli considers himself above the law. There is growing skepticism of the government representatives’ commitment to the people, or of their ability to work impartially. If some people are prosecuted while others facing similar charges are spared, even genuine cases of cooperatives frauds like those involving former home minister Lamichhane will seem a suspect. Prime Minister Oli and his coalition partners know that well, don’t they?   \nDuring his term as home minister in the previous Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government that was toppled in mid-July, Narayan Kaji Shrestha, who is also senior vice-chair of the CPN (Maoist Centre), undertook some bold actions. He swung into action on high profile corruption cases such as Bhutanese refugee scam, Lalita Niwas land grab and cross-border gold smuggling. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal met him on Sunday to ask him of the performance of the new government, the saga around the arrest of Rastriya Swatantra Party chair Rabi Lamichhane.CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, as leader of the main opposition party, convened a joint meeting of opposition parties on Friday. It seems the opposition parties want to solidify their unity against the ruling coalition. What will be the opposition camp’s strategy to build pressure on the government?The government has not been effective in relief distribution, rehabilitation and reconstruction in the areas ravaged by the devastating floods and landslides in the last week of September. Therefore, we convened the meeting to draw the government’s attention to this sorry state of affairs. Second, right since the formation of this government [in mid-July], we suspected this coalition would play a negative role in terms of controlling corruption as the present coalition partners joined hands after being scared of the anti-corruption movement launched by our government [led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal]. It has become imperative to stop the government from doing wrong things and alert the people. Third, there are suspicions that the government is preparing to make it easier for dissident groups in various parties to split political parties by amending the Political Parties Act-2017 through an ordinance. Thus, we basically wanted to press the government to effectively carry out the post-disaster rehabilitation works and stop it from various wrongdoings.Are there specific issues on which the opposition camp wants to build pressure?Effective work on rehabilitation and reconstruction in the disaster-hit areas is our immediate demand. In the long-run, we want to raise the agenda of good governance because developing Nepal as a prosperous country and ensuring social justice should be our central mission. But this isn’t possible without first curbing rampant corruption. Unfortunately, the government is taking a negative approach in this connection.Could you give more specific details where the government went wrong in terms of corruption?To take the latest example, the CPN-UML, which is headed by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, recently accepted a donation of land worth tens of millions of rupees from Min Bahadur Gurung, owner of the country’s largest retail chain, Bhatbhateni Supermarket. The business tycoon has also announced plans to make a building for the party. During our tenure, the government filed a corruption case against him in Lalita Niwas land scam. He was arrested and later the Special Court convicted him of corruption. The land has already been retained as government property. Later, he moved the Supreme Court, where the case is sub judice. Prime Minister Oli had earlier vented his ire for arresting and filing a case against Gurung. We had suspected that he had done something wrong in collusion with Gurung. Oli’s acceptance of the property in the name of donation is unacceptable on political and moral grounds. It is against the good governance drive we launched. You know, we had initiated action in various major corruption scams during our tenure. There are reports that the government is trying to give clean chit to the accused instead of taking the process ahead. Thus the present coalition is working against good governance.In the meeting of the opposition coalition on Friday, Rastriya Swatantra Party chair Rabi Lamichhane, who was arrested on Saturday, sought support of other opposition parties [based on the information that he was being arrested] arguing that action against him was politically motivated. Will the opposition parties support him?Any case should be independently and fairly investigated. No culprit should be spared. At the same time, no political bias should reflect in the investigation. We can’t say anything about the government agencies’ investigation process. The meeting stressed on the same. It was during my tenure as home minister that the government initiated the investigation against Lamichhane after a supplementary case was registered at the Kaski District Police Office, accusing him of misusing deposits from a Kaski-based cooperative. Later, the parliament formed a special probe committee to investigate. Now the home ministry has taken action against him based on the recommendation of the same panel. We have to cooperate with the government in its investigation. The only thing we can say is that the investigation should be fair and independent. No political party can stand against the investigation itself. How do you see the protests by the RSP cadres following his arrest?They can raise their voice against the possibility of political revenge in the case and demand fair investigation. But they have to cooperate in the investigation and accept the findings. No one can obstruct the investigation just because someone is a politician. The government agencies can’t enforce rule of law if all political parties start protesting against investigations on individuals affiliated to them. A few of the RSP’s concerns are valid too. They argue that the government is working in a discriminatory way. For instance, there are reports with evidence showing involvement of some Nepali Congress and CPN-UML leaders in various cooperatives’ scams. They have asked why the government is not taking any action against them. This is a valid question. The authorities should take action against Congress and UML leaders as well to prove that the government is not discriminatory.Various high-profile corruption cases were prosecuted during your tenure as home minister. You understand if a case has been built on strong or weak grounds. From that perspective, what is your observation of Lamichhane’s case?Rabi ji himself has accepted a level of involvement in the case and said that he is ready to bear the financial liability of the cooperative money invested in the Gorkha Media Network [where he was managing director]. I can comment about the overall case only after the investigation is completed.The fact that over half-a-dozen home ministers since 1990 have been prosecuted in corruption cases shows powerful politicians are involved in corruption. Can this deep-rooted corruption be cleaned up?It is one of the major reasons hindering Nepal’s development. Corruption is promoted by those who are in key state positions. Therefore, we often say our state agencies are influenced by comprador capitalists and there is no investment in productive sectors that would create jobs. Our entire economic ecosystem of creating demand, production, supply and employment has failed. The nexus between powerful politicians, bureaucrats and a handful of business tycoons is promoting activities from where they get huge commissions, and where they get to exploit state coffers. Nepal can’t progress without breaking this nexus. We had taken strong actions in that direction. Unfortunately, the present coalition stopped that process and the comprador capitalists have yet again become active.You must have faced pressure from the political and other quarters when you took action against powerful leaders. Could you give some examples of such pressure?You know, though our party led the government, the other party [Nepali Congress] was the bigger force in the coalition government and actions were taken against the major leaders of the coalition partners. Even those who were affiliated to our party faced actions. So, definitely I faced immense political pressure. But no one could stop me as I was determined to complete my mission of good governance. But a section of people accuse you of sparing individuals close to top leaders and that some individuals were later freed on bail as the cases against them weren’t built as strongly.That is not the case. I pushed the cases despite huge political pressures. But the court later freed them on bail, where we have no role. The court has put some individuals behind bars while some were released. The role of the court is certainly a matter of research. You are right that people wonder why more powerful people aren’t brought under investigation even in big scams such as Bhutanese refugee scam and Lalita Niwas land grab. Media reports indicating powerful individuals’ involvement might be true. However, the government agencies can’t take action against anyone without sufficient evidence. Many have asked why two former prime ministers—Madhav Kumar Nepal and Baburam Bhattarai—were not prosecuted. The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) didn’t recommend action against them saying that the policy decisions made in Cabinet meetings don’t fall under its jurisdiction. And, it is still unclear which decisions made in the Cabinet are policy decisions and which aren’t.The secretaries who prepare proposals for Cabinet decisions are held responsible while the ministers who present the same proposals for a decision at the Cabinet meeting and the chief of the Cabinet are not held responsible. People have raised questions about this practice. I think this is a valid question and should be addressed properly. I also believe the ministers who present a proposal for a decision should be held responsible.Also questions were raised over the way the statements of the two prime ministers [Nepal and Bhattarai] were recorded at their homes and in the absence of a government attorney.I take this criticism positively. When I enquired about this episode, police told me that they did so because the CIAA had earlier recorded other former prime ministers at their homes and the police followed the same precedent. In the future, we should be careful. There is one crucial aspect in this case. The two prime ministers weren’t prosecuted in the Lalita Niwas land grab case. But the court has proved that the land deal was wrong. So, it has been recovered as government property. Thus, the decisions taken from the Cabinet meetings [chaired by Nepal and Bhattarai] were wrong. Don’t they need to do public self-criticism?Let’s move on to party politics. As in the past, leaders in your party rigorously discussed the issue of leadership change in Maoist Centre in recent meetings. But nothing happened. Do you see any chance of leadership change in the Maoist Centre?In our recent party meetings, we discussed whether the party’s transformation is more important or leadership change. We need a more unified, transformed and stronger party to implement our party’s agenda in national politics. This is more important. We discussed whether our leadership at present is obstructing this process. Our leadership is ready to work to transform the party, make the organisation stronger and then hand over the leadership. Our chair wants to take the party back to its past strength. We have taken his spirit positively. But this doesn’t mean that Prachanda [Dahal] is irreplaceable.Amid reports about reunification between various Maoist parties, party chairman Dahal and Nepal Communist Party General Secretary Netra Bikram Chand have both spoken on the need for such reunification. Is it happening soon?Our conclusion is that our party can take leadership in carrying out important national tasks. In principle we are in the right direction but the party can’t accomplish the tasks in its present form. So it needs to be made stronger. The ideological and moral grounds of our party have eroded. We have been distanced from downtrodden communities while party leaders have increased proximity with the well-off class. On the other hand, corruption has increased within the party. Therefore, we want to transform the party into a more revolutionary and stronger force. This should be the priority. But even after that, our party’s present strength alone will not suffice to accomplish important national tasks. So we have decided to join hands with more left and Maoist forces. Discussions with various groups for party unity and forging alliances are underway.Reports say the negotiation with the Chand-led party is more positive.The [Chand-led] party made two important decisions from a central committee meeting. They decided to go for party unity and take part in the next general elections. This is an important policy departure of the party. It has increased the possibility of party unity. But we haven’t reached any definite conclusion in this connection. Do you see any chances of forging a working alliance with new forces such as the RSP?The new forces raised an agenda [of good governance] and got good support from the public in elections. But people have already started complaining against them saying that they didn’t work as per their promises. They have started comparing them to traditional forces. The new leaders from whom people had expected a lot have already courted controversy. Having said that, we can’t brush aside the public disenchantment towards major political forces as well.The RSP champions an agenda which is quite different from what the Maoist Centre lobbies for. For instance, the policies the Maoist Centre and the RSP advocate on the federal system are opposite. In this context, can the two parties be long-term allies?The RSP has failed to be honest to the agenda it championed in the elections and to make its political ideology clear. And it has adopted a wrong policy on the federal system. Therefore, at present, we can’t say that we will have a long-term strategic collaboration. There is no reliable basis for that. As far as a working alliance is concerned, it can be with any party. For instance, we have diametrically opposed political viewpoints with the Rastriya Prajatantra Party. They want monarchy while we are strongly for the republic system. They are against federalism while we want a stronger federal system. But we can still forge a working alliance with them on certain agendas.Opposition parties seem quite scared of ordinance on Political Parties Act-2017. There is a need to end the legal void that exists after Congress-Maoist Centre government issued an ordinance three years ago. Is it based on the information about certain provisions that the government is implementing or because it is being brought by bypassing the parliament?It is true that there has been delay in reviving the provisions of the law that were inactivated after introduction of the ordinance at the time. We want that to be done through parliament. Now the government wants to make changes in it because it wants to meet certain vested political interests through it. There are suspicions that the present government leadership is working to split small parties and make the UML the largest in the House of Representatives.Why would Congress help the prime minister bring an ordinance that would make it smaller than the UML?That is why they might be at loggerheads over the issue. What I heard is that both the proposals to arrest Rabi Lamichhane and to issue the ordinance on the Political Parties Act-2017 were discussed in the same Cabinet meeting. The Congress reportedly pushed for the proposal on Lamichhane while the prime minister was for issuing the ordinance as well. It is certain that there is a tug of war between the two sides over the ordinance. \nCentral and eastern parts of Nepal witnessed devastating incidents of landslides and floods last week. At least 244 people were killed, while 19 are still missing. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Basanta Raj Adhikari, director at the Centre for Disaster Studies, Institute of Engineering at Tribhuvan University, to discuss how the country can be better prepared to manage the disasters and minimise damages.Recently we faced disastrous floods and landslides. How do you analyse the losses? Could the damages have been reduced with better preparation and timely response?To begin with, I want to make one thing clear. There is a fundamental difference between a disaster and hazard. Hazard is always natural but it becomes a disaster if there is human involvement. If there is a landslide in a jungle with no human activity, it is a hazard. If a landslide hit a human settlement and it required external involvement to restore the place, then it becomes a disaster. An earthquake is a hazard but it becomes a disaster when man-made structures kill people. As far as the losses from the recent floods are concerned, we could have minimised them with better preparation. For instance, Nakkhu was one of the worst hit areas in the Kathmandu Valley. The river there has drastically narrowed and a human settlement has been developed on the riverbanks in recent years. Human activities in rivers are natural as human civilisations took place on the banks of rivers. But it should be done without disrupting the natural flow of the water. We developed huge settlements encroaching the riverbanks. This invited huge losses. Such activities could have been avoided.As Nepal witnessed record-high rainfalls, were not these losses to be expected? It is true that the country witnessed record rainfalls this season, the highest in the past over five decades. Climate change has caused extreme weather events in recent years. But we can’t blame only natural factors. If you see the images of 2003, it clearly shows that the place where the MediCity Hospital now stands is clearly the floodplain of the Nakkhu river. If you go further downstream, you see a colony. This is how we have encroached riverbanks. We can encroach rivers but it should be done in a scientific way. What is scientific encroachment of rivers?We can model flooding based on the highest volume of water a river can carry. Based on such evidence, we can decide what kind of activities can and cannot be carried out on a riverbank. We can develop settlements but that should be based on scientific evidence and data. Another important concept we should follow is risk sensitive land use planning. Nepal government has already prepared land use maps of all the 753 local units that give vital information about a particular place such as the soil, land capability, risk layer, present land use map, zoning map and cadastral layer. But some people have stopped the authorities from implementing the maps as once they are passed, a land categorised as an agricultural area cannot be converted into commercial land. If that scheme is implemented, one can’t build a house in high flood land. Now the local authorities enforce only the building codes and that don’t include these provisions. That doesn’t inquire whether a building is being built on a riverbank or a landslide susceptible area. In developed countries, those who build in high flood risk areas have to pay more in insurance. Also, areas are categorised based on the chances of occurrence of landslides on the basis of soil type, rock type, geology, distance from a drainage or a road etcetera and structures built there are dealt with accordingly. We are witnessing extreme weather events. In this context, what should we do to prevent more loss in the days ahead?We require an engineering paradigm shift in building infrastructures. The extreme weather patterns have made the data we used to refer to in the past while building infrastructures irrelevant. The data on water levels that were referred to while making a bridge in a river now need to be updated as water levels in our rivers have been rising in recent years. The existing infrastructures can’t withstand that volume of water. We witnessed record rainfalls last week. This can be a reference data for some years. Also, the sedimentation pattern has changed because of human settlements built upstream.Second, we have a generalised rule of building roads across the country. The impact of 200 millilitres of rainfall in Pokhara and rainfall of the same volume in Jhapa is different. As Pokhara experiences rains on a regular basis, the soil in the area can withstand it because it has been weathered by regular rain but the same volume of rainfall can cause more losses in Jhapa because of weak soil there. We thus have to consider the strength of soil while building a structure in a particular place.There is a single road construction method across the country, whether the place is in a high himalayan range, Mahabharat, Shivalik hills or plains. We have to make specific rules for specific places based on the geological and soil structures. The parameters of road construction should be redefined. We are improving the weather forecasting system but now we also need impact-based forecasting to inform the public not only about the volume of likely rainfall but also its likely impact.Where are the problems in our disaster response approach?The Natural Calamity (Relief) Act, 1982 was guided by a fatalistic approach as it saw natural hazards as destined by fate. Then came Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act, 2017. This change in law is in fact a paradigm shift in disaster management in Nepal. The new law’s perspective is progressive. The new Act changed us from response-centric to preparedness-centric. Legally, we are on a progressive path. But we lag in implementation. We also need to upgrade our skills in handling the situation. Our constitution as well as laws have entrusted local units with the responsibility of handling disaster incidents on their own. The government should make people at the local level aware, and equip and train them for the purpose.Training on some important procedures such as the INSARAG preparedness and response guidelines can be quite effective. Such training and other activities aimed at helping local units to handle disaster incidents should be conducted at the ward levels. “Understanding risk” is an important aspect in disaster management. So common people should be sensitised to the consequences of disaster incidents. You can see people collecting timber from flooded rivers, taking selfies on riverbanks and gathering on a bridge above a roaring river. People at all local wards need to be well-equipped. Those who were swept away at Nakkhu could have been saved if the security personnel and other people there had at least motorboats and life jackets. Our rescue workers now lack even such basic things.Settlements in Nepal’s mountainous and hill areas are located in equally risky zones. What should be done to safeguard them?The mountains in our region are taken as young and the Himalayan range is in the building process. It is also called an active mountain belt. Therefore, we experience frequent earthquakes. Earthquakes cause geomorphological changes. A large number of settlements in Nepal’s hills sit on the debris of old landslides that might have occurred long back. People there should be made aware of the risk and these places be identified. Engineering measures should be taken to make them safe. Scattered populations mainly in the highlands need to be integrated in concentrated settlements.What is the latest status of glaciers and glacial lakes in our mountains?The pace of glacial melting is rising alarmingly because of rising temperature. Earlier, we took only big glacial lakes as threats and gave them more attention but recent incidents showed that even smaller ones pose a threat. The incident of the Thame glacial lake outburst in August showed how the outburst of even a small glacial lake could have a cascading effect. Likewise, the deposits of landslides being piled above 3,000 metres are another serious challenge. Such sediment deposition is increasing in the mountains while there is a huge population downstream. The frequency of cascading hazards has increased, emerging as a major challenge. A landslide blocks a river and when the river breaches the structure built of debris, it causes devastating losses downstream.How can we scientifically prove that the hazards we are seeing were the result of climate change?There has to be scientific evidence to make the link. For instance, the Thame glacial outburst was clearly a climate change-induced hazard as it did not involve human activities. The treeline and snowline are shifting upwards in our mountains. There were no mosquitoes in Mustang until some years ago. Now mosquitos are widespread in the district as temperature there has significantly increased. The crop pattern has changed drastically. Thus we have a number of scientific evidence to show clear signs of climate change in this part of the world. What the government should now do is properly document these climate change-induced incidents following internationally-accepted methods and present them at relevant UN bodies. \nNepal's economy, facing setbacks since 2015, is projected to improve, according to the IMF and ADB, despite ongoing infrastructure damage, decreasing capital formation, private sector pessimism, and a reliance on remittance, tourism, and energy exports.\nThe parliamentary probe report on the cooperatives scam implicates Rabi Lamichhane and 49 others in embezzling Rs2.58 billion from multiple cooperatives, despite failing to establish direct links between Lamichhane and specific financial transactions.\nPartly cloudy weather with isolated thunderstorms forecast for Koshi and Lumbini provinces, and hilly areas; mostly fair weather elsewhere; Dhangadhi records highest temperature (37.3°C), Jumla records lowest (4.1°C); light rainfall in Biratnagar, Dharan, and Lumle.\nOn Thursday, most of Nepal faces partly cloudy to fair weather, with chances of light rain in hilly regions of Koshi and Gandaki provinces; western and local winds influence the country, with Janakpur and Jumla experiencing the highest and lowest temperatures on Wednesday.\nPartly cloudy to fair weather expected, with light rain or thunderstorms possible in hilly areas, especially in Koshi and Gandaki provinces; Janakpur warmest (37.6°C), Jomsom coldest (4.5°C).\nOn Tuesday the weather is forecast to be partly to generally cloudy in Karnali and Sudur Pashchim Province along with the hilly regions of Koshi, Bagmati and Gandaki Province and partly cloudy to mainly fair in the rest of the country.Light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is likely to occur at a few places of hilly regions of Karnali and Sudur Pashchim Province and at one or two places of hilly regions of Koshi, Bagmati and Gandaki Province.

Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nThe construction of 120 micro- and medium-level hydropower projects, mostly undertaken by the private sector, has been badly affected after India failed to supply explosives through the Nepal Army.Although this is not a new problem, as several private sector hydropower projects have for years been facing explosives shortages, the crisis has again become severe. The Independent Power Producers’ Association Nepal (IPPAN), an associate of private developers, has started reaching out to ministers to facilitate smooth supply.“We met Foreign Minister Arzu Rana on Wednesday and told her to address our demands immediately,” said Ganesh Karki of IPPAN. “We also met Energy Minister Dipak Khadka and others, and asked them to take our concerns seriously.”According to Karki, of the 183 hydropower projects that are under construction and mostly owned by the private sector, 65 percent of those needing explosives are experiencing delays due to the lack of timely availability.These projects, with a combined installed capacity of 4,000 megawatts, are under construction, while another group of projects of the same capacity have signed power purchase agreements (PPA) with the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) and are in the process of financial closure, said IPPAN in its demands submitted to minister Rana. It added that 80 percent of additional hydropower projects with combined capacity of 20,000 megawatts that are in various stages of development, are led by the private sector and these are also affected by explosives shortage.“Due to the unavailability of explosives on time, several of these hydropower projects are not being completed on time and their construction costs are also increasing. After failing to complete the projects on time, the private sector is forced to pay huge amounts in penalties,” IPPAN said in its memorandum to Minister Rana.“In most cases when we have taken up the matter, officials, leaders and diplomats have cited ‘geopolitical’ reasons behind India’s sluggish approach to supplying explosives,” an IPPAN official said. “Sometimes the Indians blame us for providing explosives to projects not designated for their use.”The process of importing explosives involves the private sector opening a letter of credit (LC) and, as per the LC , the Indian side supplies the explosives to the Nepal Army, which then distributes the explosives to the private sector, as there are concerts that direct supply to the private sector could lead to misuse.Even though the army has for long been producing commercial explosives at its Sunchari Emulsion Plant in Makawanpur district, it does not churn out enough to meet the demands of all the country’s infrastructure projects. The army relies on raw materials imported from India to manufacture these explosives, but it still struggles to keep up with the demand in the market.After Chinese companies and firms started making inroads into Nepal’s energy sector, we noticed Indian uneasiness, which ultimately resulted in two things—not buying Nepali electricity with any Chinese involvement and halting the supply of explosives for projects, a former foreign ministry official said. “Meanwhile, we sometimes tried to import explosives from China, and this may have irked the Indians.”After Indian reservations, Nepali hydropower producers began submitting all details of investors and promoters so that India would stop raising concerns, but this too did not yield positive results, said an IPPAN office bearer. In April last year, some private firms brought in around 90 tons of explosives from China, but that supply did not last, and there were issues with price, time constraints, and other factors.Generally the Indian Embassy in Kathmandu issues a ‘No Objection Certificate’ (NOC) for the supply of explosives for infrastructure projects. Nepal has of late been importing explosives exclusively from India. After explosives became scarce, the government changed the law. According to a new rule, explosives can be borrowed for roads, energy projects and other development projects that require blasting. Projects can borrow explosives only when they face a shortage and cannot get an immediate supply, and when the Nepal Army is also unable to provide them. “If a project doesn’t require explosives immediately and has them in excess, it can provide them to another project,” the new rule says.When a hydropower project faced a similar problem last year, the government tried to import explosives from China, but that proved unfeasible due to very high cost, time consuming import process, and other factors.The current requirement only for hydropower projects is around 5,000 metric tons, with 199 metric tons needed on a monthly basis, said Karki.Nepal Army spokesperson Brigadier General Gaurav Kumar KC admitted that there is a shortage of explosives and production, and the army’s plant in Hetauda is unable to meet the current demand. Most hydropower projects have been facing shortage of explosives since last December. “We can only meet 20-30 percent of the demand and the rest is met by the private sector,” said Brigadier General KC. He also acknowledged that the army itself has been unable to get enough raw materials to produce explosives according to demand.After hearing the concerns of IPPAN officials, Foreign Minister Rana assured them that she would try her best to facilitate the import of explosives required for hydropower projects.IPPAN has also warned that if shortages continue, Nepal’s target of producing 28,500 megawatts in ten years will not be fulfilled, and the country’s goal of exporting 10,000 megawatts of energy to India in next ten years will be affected.In order to encourage foreign investment in energy, IPPAN has urged the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to facilitate the import of explosives, create an environment of exporting 10,000 megawatts of energy to India in next ten years, and coordinate with Nepali missions abroad to attract foreign investment in the energy sector. As per the Working Procedure on Import, Transport, Storage and Use of Explosives-2017, the import, transport, and storage of explosives for industrial and construction projects should be carried out under strict vigilance of the Nepal Army.Imported explosives, mostly from India, are managed by the army, which oversees their distribution, storage and use, said Karki. And during detonations, the army sets up a dedicated camp near the project site to ensure the explosions are carried out safely. \nManorama Sadda and her husband, Umesh, from Siraha’s Betauna, spent years watching their son Pratik struggle with communication and behavioural issues. What began as subtle delays in speech and awkward social interactions eventually translated into academic difficulties.By the time their son was nine, his teachers were growing concerned. Yet, for Manorama and Umesh, the possibility that their child could have a deeper intellectual or emotional challenge never crossed their minds.“We thought he was just a bit slower than other children,” Manorama says. “Everyone around us said boys take time to mature, so we didn’t worry. We had no idea it was something serious.”Their son’s autism was recognised too late, and only after 2020 when his teacher recommended they seek professional help. “We had never heard of such problems, and we didn’t even know where to go,” Umesh says.In Nepal, children’s mental health issues are often neglected due to a lack of awareness, social stigma, and insufficient medical infrastructure.For many parents, by the time they seek help, the damage has been done, with lifelong implications for their children’s development.“Although children and adolescents comprise over 42 percent of Nepal’s population, mental health awareness in this demographic remains woefully inadequate,” says Dr Arun Raj Kunwar, a child psychiatrist at Kanti Children’s Hospital.According to Kunwar, the Child and Adolescent Mental Health (CAMH) Unit at Kanti Children’s Hospital in Kathmandu, established in 2015, remains the only full-time child and adolescent psychiatry outpatient clinic (CAP OPD) in the country.“In the absence of dedicated inpatient units for children, young patients who need hospitalisation are often placed in adult psychiatric wards—an alarming violation of international standards,” says Kunwar.The limited access to mental health services outside major urban centres is stark.Accessing this service was a struggle for parents like Manorama and Umesh. “We spent months going from one hospital to another,” Umesh says. “The facilities for children’s mental health are almost non-existent outside Kathmandu. We ended up taking our son out of school and coming to Kanti Children’s Hospital for treatment.”Specialised mental health services for children in Nepal are sparse, and the few centres that do exist are concentrated in cities like Kathmandu.Experts like Kunwar have witnessed this firsthand. “We are doing what we can, but it’s far from enough,” says Kunwar. He explained that between July and December 2015, the hospital registered around 600 cases. By 2018, this number had surged to over 2,400, and by 2019, it had climbed to 3,000. In 2023, the figure exceeded 6,000.However, Kunwar says that the rise in numbers should not be mistaken for a progress in accessibility and awareness. “At first glance, the increasing figures might suggest improvements in screening, but the reality is that we still struggle to make these services accessible to all,” he says.With 42 percent of Nepal’s population being children and studies showing that every child requires some form of psychological support during their developmental phase, Kunwar says that countless cases across the country remain undiagnosed and untreated.The National Mental Health Survey Nepal-2020 reports that 5.2 percent of adolescents suffer from mental disorders, with neurotic and stress-related conditions being the most prevalent at 2.8 percent. Additionally, 0.6 percent of children and adolescents are affected by depression.However, much like Kunwar, experts believe the actual rate of mental health issues could be higher, estimating that 10 to 15 percent of this population may be dealing with various mental health challenges. They attribute the lower figures in the survey to methodological limits.A lack of trained professionals compounds this shortfall. There are fewer than a dozen child and adolescent psychiatrists in the country.“Even in state-run facilities, only a handful of specialists are available,” adds Kunwar. “For a country with such a large population of children, this is a glaring problem.”One big reason behind the delay in seeking mental health care is the stigma associated with mental health disorders. For many parents, admitting that their child might have a psychological issue is seen as shameful, leading to avoidance or denial.As Dr Kunwar explains, “Even though awareness is spreading slowly, parents often come to us only when the situation becomes severe. This is due to both the lack of awareness and the stigma associated with mental health.”A 2019 study published in the ‘International Journal of Mental Health Systems’ highlights the prevalence of child and adolescent mental health disorders in Nepal, with anxiety disorders, behavioural problems, and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) being the most common. However, much of this research remains limited. “Nepal lacks large-scale, national-level studies that can truly assess the extent of mental health issues among children,” the study notes. With such data missing, the government’s response remains insufficient, leaving many families without the needed resources.Even the mental health of school children has been affected. A study published in the Journal of Lumbini Medical College, which is available on nepjol.info, found that among 902 secondary school students, 5 percent had mental health problems, while 14 percent were likely to develop them.Peer problems, emotional difficulties, and conduct disorders are common, yet teachers and parents remain largely unaware of how to recognise these signs or provide support. Early screening in schools, the study says, could help detect these issues before they become more severe.But, in reality, schools have not been able to do so.For Nepal to properly address the mental health situation of its population, both awareness and infrastructure need immediate attention.Experts warn that prolonged periods of neglect, especially during formative years, could lead to more severe problems later in life.Yet, support remains scarce, especially in rural areas where parents like Manorama and Umesh live. “The government needs to act quickly to expand mental health services beyond Kathmandu,” Kunwar says. “If we don’t intervene now, we risk creating a future generation burdened by untreated mental health issues.”To tackle the rising mental health issues among children and adolescents, the Ministry of Health and Population announced in August 2024 that it would start training health workers to assess mental health conditions in this age group.The plan includes training 150 medical officers, nurses, and paramedics to screen children and adolescents for mental health concerns. Experts like Kunwar hope the government will continue to expand such initiatives, particularly in rural areas, to ensure that even children in remote regions have access to essential mental health services. \nPrices of almost all vegetables have shot up in the past week, burning a hole in many households' budgets amid festivities.Most green vegetables sell above Rs100 per kg; some have even crossed the Rs200 per kg mark.Cauliflower, cowpea, green bean, bitter gourd, bottle gourd, potato, onion, chayote, pointed gourd, tomato, cabbage, eggplant, and okra now cost above Rs100 per kg.Nearly four weeks since the heavy rainfall at the end of September devastated the country, battered crops and severed supply lines, vegetable vendors still blame the price surge on the production and supply disruption.“It is becoming difficult to manage household expenses. The prices are rising and rising,” said Nabina Sunuwar, a homemaker.“How can we afford cauliflower at Rs200 per kg and eggplant at Rs110 per kg?” she asked.“We have a limited income source, and food prices rising every day is worrisome.”Binay Shrestha, information officer at the Kalimati Fruits and Vegetable Market Development Board, said that the seasonal vegetable production, particularly the post-monsoon output, has declined so the market receives only smaller quantities.“We hope the prices will cool down once the winter seasonal vegetables arrive.”He blamed a mismatch between the output and supply for the rising prices.The Kalimati market, the country’s largest vegetable wholesale platform, has been receiving 500 tonnes of vegetables daily for the past few weeks.On Thursday, the market received 507 tonnes of vegetables. Normally, the Kalimati market handles 700-800 tonnes of vegetables daily.However, the demand increases amid short supplies during the festivities, and prices go up, said Shrestha.Of the 500 tonnes of vegetables that arrive at the Kalimati market, 40 percent are potatoes and onions. Green vegetables make up the rest.Traders said that the prices might slowly cool after Tihar and Chhath festivals, with more consignments coming from farms.Consumer rights activists said that leaving the vegetable market unchecked has caused the prices to reach uncontrollably high.Vegetable prices have increased by more than 300 percent within a month, and this is not only because of the low output, said Prem Lal Maharjan, president of the National Consumer Forum. “The government is either unaware of the issue, or it is simply giving traders a free hand.”“It is the government's responsibility to monitor the supply situation and push down prices during the festivals and a crisis.”Changing weather patterns have significantly impacted vegetable production. A record high rainfall in Kathmandu and other parts of the country damaged crops, reduced yield and also affected the supply of vegetables from other districts. This has created a supply crunch, leading to the rise in prices.The inflation in vegetables has increased, central bank’s data show.According to Nepal Rastra Bank, the year-on-year consumer price inflation stood at 3.85 percent in mid-September, compared to 8.19 percent a year ago.However, vegetable inflation increased by 9.84 percent in the review period.The Kalimati Fruits and Vegetable Market Development Board's wholesale vegetable price index shows that the price of most vegetables, such as tomatoes, onions, carrots, cauliflower, and cowpeas, has crossed Rs100 per kg. The wholesale price of tomatoes has crossed Rs125 per kg, while in retail, they sell for Rs200 to Rs210 per kg.On Friday, potato wholesale price was Rs82.67 per kg at Kalimati, but in retail, it traded for Rs130 to Rs135 per kg.The wholesale price of cauliflower has reached Rs130 per kg, a 73.33 percent jump in two months. The vegetables now cost Rs200 to Rs205 per kg.The wholesale price of French beans (rajma) has skyrocketed by 40.74 percent to Rs190 per kg. In retail, it costs Rs270 per kg. \nMany books are said to have the power to heal, but can a book trouble you? I didn’t realise it until I read Kate Elizabeth Russell’s ‘My Dark Vanessa’. This novel has deeply impacted me, breaking my heart. I even allowed it to rob me of peaceful sleep. It is devastatingly beautiful and worth every bit of the sorrow it left behind.Russell weaves themes of love, trauma, denial, grooming, and the long-term effects of abuse. I struggle to express how a story filled with pain and turmoil can be portrayed with such beauty. How does grooming blur the lines between love, control, and abuse? This is one of the novelvs most Intriguing questions. ‘My Dark Vanessa’ begins in 2017, introducing 30-year-old Vanessa Wye as she prepares to work at a hotel in Portland, Maine. The narrative opens with her refreshing her Facebook page. She is anxiously awaiting updates about Jacob Strane, who is her former English teacher and is under investigation for sexual assault by a former student.The story alternates between this timeline and Vanessa’s past, starting in 2000 when she is a 15-year-old scholarship student at a prestigious boarding school, Browick. In the same year, Vanessa’s relationship with her best friend had turned cold, and no one had filled the vacuum. Vanessa isn’t particularly close to her parents either. Her mother urges her to promise that she will make a large group of new friends so she won’t spend all day alone in her room. Vanessa’s mother is determined for her to “get out there” and live a fuller life this year.To cope with her loneliness and become more involved, Vanessa joins the creative writing club, where Jacob Strane is the faculty advisor. After learning that Vanessa has no friends, Jacob asks her personal questions. As their conversation continues, Jacob's behaviour makes Vanessa uneasy. These lines from the book reveal the beginning of something unsettling: “Mr Strane sets the eraser on the chalk rail and contemplates me from across the room. He slips his hands into his pockets and looks me up and down.”“That's a nice dress. I like your style.”A middle-aged teacher commenting on a student’s outfit feels uncomfortable. One day, in the classroom, Vanessa makes a mistake on the computer. Jacob reaches down, places his hand over hers, and guides the mouse. When she makes another mistake, he repeats the action but squeezes her hand this time. What’s disturbing is that Jacob doesn’t behave this way with other students. This marks the beginning of Jacob’s physical closeness to Vanessa.Gradually, Jacob starts asking to read Vanessa’s poems and writings. He praises her work, making her feel special—intoxicating, as she feels isolated and misunderstood at school. Jacob’s behaviour is a mix of charm and manipulation, which lays the groundwork for a grooming process where he preys on her vulnerabilities, convincing her that their bond is unique and meaningful. Over time, Vanessa enjoys his attention, secretly longing to be noticed.One day, while Jacob is still focused on her poem, his knee brushes against Vanessa’s bare thigh beneath her skirt’s hemline. Vanessa freezes. As he continues reading, he tells her she’s a dark romantic like him, someone drawn to dark things. Then, he pats her knee. She remains paralysed, unable to move, while he continues marking her poem, his other hand slowly stroking her knee. At that moment, Vanessa feels disconnected, as though she has changed and become something less than human.Vanessa feels detachment and disorientation as Jacob touches her. She is no longer grounded in her body, drifting away from her sense of self. The unsettling actions make her feel alienated and disconnected from her usual identity as a teenage student. She feels she has transformed into something unfamiliar and distant, leaving her unable to respond or react.Then, as days pass, Vanessa feels desperate for something more to happen between them. Little touches turn into kisses. Russell describes how Vanessa feels a sense of power to make a 42-year-old teacher fall at her feet. With a man 27 years older than her, Vanessa thinks that she has encountered love for the first time. Russell articulates Vanessa as fearless and bold for wanting something that can ruin her being. When Jacob invited her to his house, she readily agreed. Russell describes Vanessa in Jacob’s house, how she feels being there, what they do together, and what Jacob does to Vanessa. Although Vanessa perceives these encounters as consensual or romantic due to Jacob's grooming tactics, they are exploitative. Jacob positions himself as a lover while simultaneously reinforcing his dominance through emotional manipulation—he convinces her that she instigated their relationship and that their bond is special.Later, when Vanessa becomes more mature, a part of her believes that she was mistreated by Jacob, and another part wants those things more. When you are traumatised, when you are exposed to a negative feeling a lot, you start to get accustomed to it. You associate meaning with it. That is what Vanessa did: she associated abuse with love. The adult Vanessa struggles with her past, unable to form genuine connections with others. Now in her thirties, she finds disinterest in relationships with men her age. Instead, she focuses on Jacob, who occupies a central place in her thoughts.Despite the revelations of Strane's predatory behaviour towards other students, Vanessa clings to the belief that their relationship is special and consensual. This attachment is rooted in a complex mix of nostalgia and denial; she perceives Jacob as her first love, complicating her ability to move on. Vanessa often romanticises her past with Jacob, seeing it as a love story rather than confronting the manipulation and abuse she endured. This mindset drives her to fiercely defend him, even as she struggles with the truth of his actions. Her inner turmoil is captured in this powerful monologue:“I just really need it to be a love story. You know? I really, really need it to be that.” “Because if it isn’t a love story, then what is it?” “It’s my life. This has been my whole life.”These lines are loaded with emotional weight, and reading them brought me to tears. Russell captures Vanessa’s internal conflict perfectly—how she mistakes abuse for love and refuses to see herself as a victim.Jacob, unable to face the consequences after being exposed by his former students, is later found dead in a river, with suicide suspected. As Vanessa processes his death, she tries to piece together her life and heal.By the novel’s end, Vanessa adopts a dog and takes it for a walk. With the sun on her face and the dog beside her, Russell writes that Vanessa feels an immense capacity for good. She is finally stepping into a new chapter of her life, free from Jacob’s presence in her mind.I couldn’t have wished for a more fitting conclusion to this haunting yet powerful novel.My Dark Vanessa Author: Kate Elizabeth RussellPublisher: William MorrowYear: 2020Pages: 384 \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli presented his government’s 100-day report on Wednesday. While presenting his accomplishments, Oli committed to take action against cooperatives frauds and to refund the money of depositors.As the prime minister claimed that the government was making progress in terms of creating the environment for returning the savings of cooperatives depositors, the National Campaign for Protection of Cooperative Depositors has announced the fourth phase of protest, accusing the authorities of not implementing the agreements reached with them in the past.Alleging the government’s non-commitment to implementing its earlier promises made with the National Campaign for Protection of Cooperative Depositors, leaders of the campaign on Thursday organised a press meet in Kathmandu on Thursday where they announced to start the fourth phase of protests from November 20.They said they would still wait for the government to implement the agreements until the deadline. The representatives of the victims claimed that the fourth phase of the protest would be a decisive one.“Despite reaching an eight-point agreement one-and-a-half months ago, the government has not cared to address the problem since. Therefore, we planned to resume our protest,” Kusluv KC, chair of the campaign, told the Post.“Minister for land management, cooperatives, and poverty alleviation [Balaram Adhikari]’s claim at a press conference on Wednesday that they addressed our concerns made us furious.”The government had reached an eight-point agreement with the cooperatives victims on September 9. It was the third agreement signed between the government and the depositors who lost their savings within a year.“Not only are cooperatives frauds being prosecuted, but initiatives are also being taken to formulate a cooperatives authority act, and establish a cooperatives credit information centre and debt recovery tribunal that are necessary to refund depositors’ money,\" Prime Minister Oli said, while presenting the government's progress in its 100 days in office on Wednesday.Cooperatives victims resumed their third phase of protests on June 24, accusing the government of failing to implement agreements signed with two ministers in the past.The victims staged the first phase of their agitation in June last year. They reached a seven-point agreement with Ranjita Shrestha, then-minister for land management, cooperatives, and poverty alleviation.As the agreement was not implemented, they launched the second phase of agitation. On March 22 this year, they signed an eight-point agreement with Minister Adhikari.The victims suspended their 108-day protest following the eight-point agreement of September 9 as the government reiterated its promise to return their savings. The eight points were agreed upon after a negotiation between the representatives of the National Campaign for Protection of Cooperative Depositors and government officials in the presence of Arjun Prasad Pokharel, the secretary at the ministry.As per the agreement, a committee was formed with the sub-registrar of the Cooperatives Department as coordinator. Its mandate was to continuously assist in collecting and analysing data to address issues, including the return of depositors’ savings. The committee comprises representatives from the ministry and the national campaign. The campaign chair, Kushluv KC, said Singh KC, a Kuleshwar-based Gautam Shree Cooperative victim, agreed to represent them on the committee. “The committee agreed to monitor the inspection of crisis-ridden cooperatives, collect all the details, and categorise cooperatives,” Kushluv KC told the Post. “The committee was supposed to present its findings and recommendations to the department after analysing the collected data.”But one and a half months after the third-phase agreement, government agencies did not seem positive about holding the meeting as agreed to solve the problem, KC blamed.The committee agreed to conduct financial analysis of the inspected cooperatives, categorise them as well-functioning, crisis-oriented, and crisis-ridden, and recommend necessary actions. It was also agreed that a review meeting would be held at the Ministry of Land Management on the last Sunday of every month to assess the committee’s progress. However, the cooperatives victims say no point of the agreement was implemented.Similarly, the agreement reaffirmed the government's commitment to implementing the previous agreements made with cooperatives victims.“The victims might have thought that the execution of the agreement means immediate receipt of money, which has not happened,” Tola Raj Upadhyaya, deputy registrar and information officer at the Department of Cooperatives, said. “But the government is seriously working to implement the agreement.”In a separate announcement, the government had announced to return the money of small depositors in troubled cooperatives during the budget presentation. It has, however, defaulted on this pledge as well.During the budget presentation for the fiscal year 2024-25 on May 28, the government announced a plan to refund the savings of these small depositors.“To solve the problem in the savings and credit cooperatives, arrangements will be made to return depositers’ money up to Rs500,000 by using the property of cooperatives operators or of their immediate kin as collateral,” then-finance minister Barsha Man Pun said in his budget speech in Parliament.The Post talked to the Ministry of Land Management, Cooperatives and Poverty Alleviation officials shortly after the budget presentation for clarification on how the refund plan would go ahead.At the time, ministry officials had said the government policy, already endorsed by Parliament, would take effect from the start of the new fiscal year. However, five months into the new fiscal year, the government is still busy drafting guidelines to carry out the refund.“Apart from drafting guidelines, we also are waiting for the real data on the cooperatives victims; we are yet to receive the data from the provincial and local governments,” Upadhyaya told the Post. “Once the data is obtained, the money of the victims will be returned by selling the property of the people who misappropriated cooperatives funds.” \nThe gloomy days are upon us again. No sooner had the devastating monsoon rains left Nepali skies than the dry weather started. Those who had gone to their homes to celebrate the biggest festival, Dashain, have returned to cities, as have vehicles, contributing to the rising carbon monoxide levels. Farmers who have finished their seasonal harvest have piled up stubble on their farms to be burned openly. In a matter of days, thick haze and smoke coming from vehicles and farms will blanket the country, including the capital, Kathmandu, which has seen a worsening air quality in recent years. But the problem is by no means limited to Kathmandu.Stubble burning presents a bigger problem than imagined. In Nepal’s Tarai belt, burning harvest residues has become common and has only increased in recent years. A report from 2020, “A model-ready emission inventory for crop residue open burning in the context of Nepal,” shows how farmers’ increasing use of modern agricultural machines like combine harvesters contributes to increasing emissions. These machines save farmers’ time but leave plenty of residue behind. The general public and farmers are yet to internalise how their negligence is contributing to air pollution in the country, endangering lives, including their own. This has affected the vulnerable elderly and children the most; people of other ages are also facing health issues like pneumonia, bronchitis, conjunctivitis, skin allergy, stroke, and heart problems. Every year, particulate matter pollution takes the lives of 40,000 people in Nepal. Yet the public and government continue to pay scant attention to the issue. Smog also drifts to our part of the sky from India, the southern neighbour. Stubble burning is rampant in the country’s breadbasket states of Punjab and Haryana. This year alone, 22 stubble-burning complaints have been made to the police in Haryana, as per Reuters. No matter how hard these states have tried to put a lid on the problem by arresting farmers responsible for poor air, Delhi’s air is already becoming dangerous. Kathmandu’s air quality index will likely deteriorate if instances of stubble burning increase both at home and in India. Already on Wednesday, Chitwan, a city around 170 km southwest of Kathmandu, fared even worse than the national capital, with an AQI of 150.To address this crisis, farmers should be encouraged and sensitised to use climate-smart technologies, including modified combine harvesters and reaper harvesters, and taught about alternative uses of residues, like feeding them to animals, livestock rearing, and making biodegradable waste. Lighting them up should be the last resort. If these methods don’t work, the government can also punish repeat offenders through strict legal action. Cross-border climate diplomacy also needs to be ramped up—this has really become indispensable as climate change respects no borders. With the impending danger of air pollution, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City, in collaboration with other federal stakeholders, has geared up to mitigate the problem this year through smoke metres, which detect vehicle emissions. But this is not enough. Again, the country should be able to control open burning and punish those involved in it. For this, the federal government must come up with a long-term plan. Other local units, particularly those with rampant stubble burning, must also step up to the plate. The problem is air pollution is too serious and too urgent to put off for another day.  \nIn the last week of September, Nepal’s upper Koshi catchment area received the heaviest rainfall ever recorded in the region’s history. The unprecedented rainfall triggered landslides and flooding, resulting in 246 fatalities, over 16,000 families being affected and extensive damages to physical infrastructures, including roads, electricity and water supply systems. While over 50 districts were afflicted, Kavrepalanchowk was hit the hardest.Despite the immediate response from different directions, a detailed factual analysis has not emerged yet. However, previous studies have highlighted the region's increasing environmental challenges and potential for disaster. These underline the significant loss of water sources and rapid land use changes in the Roshi catchment area, where agriculture and pastoral lands have been increasingly converted for stone mining. The debris accumulation from the mining activities along the Roshi River banks posed a serious risk. Eventually, such continuous environmental exploitation resulted in heavy rains that caused severe flooding in the river.Impact on water supplyThe flooding of the Roshi has impacted two big water supply systems supplying water to Dhulikhel, Panauti and Banepa. These projects, which draw water from the upstream tributaries of the Roshi to supply the cities downstream, were completely disrupted after the flood washed away the main pipelines and other physical infrastructures. Although floodwaters have receded and the downstream users in Dhulikhel are attempting to restore the water supply system, they face resistance from upstream communities. The people living upstream, whose water supply system was severely damaged, demand that their local supply system be rebuilt before restoring the downstream supply. This has led to a confrontation between upstream and downstream users over their continuous water sharing. This is not the only example of a disaster which has exposed the vulnerability of Nepal’s water infrastructure. A destructive flood in Melamchi in June 2021 was caused by the sudden landslides that blocked the river after incessant rainfall damaged the Melamchi Water Supply Project. The project supplies water to Kathmandu Valley. It took over a year to restore water from this project, which is closed during the monsoon season. Similarly, the landslide from the 2015 Gorkha earthquake swept away pipelines of the Bidur Water Supply Project, causing the people to rely on a hodgepodge of alternatives until the renovation of the system. Nepal's bigger water supply systems that transport water from distant sources in the mid-hills are highly vulnerable to disaster events. The recurring damage and destruction to the bigger water supply systems from the disasters in the mid-hills of Nepal have raised some critical issues. The region’s hydrological regime has been disrupted repeatedly due to the changing climate, destructive development practices and rapid land use changes. Consequently, several springs that could serve as alternatives to bigger water supply systems are gradually drying up. When an important water supply system is damaged, a considerable investment is wasted, and substantial time and resources are required for reconstruction. Moreover, consumers face higher costs during slow rebuilding, as in our case.In most cities, once the water supply is distributed through a large-scale project, there is a tendency to neglect previously relied upon smaller water sources, such as small springs, traditional wells and stone spouts. Without proper conservation, these local sources dry up over time, further disrupting the hydrological system. These sources could become important alternatives when the bigger water supply systems are disrupted. This is prevalent in the cases from Kathmandu, Bidur and Dhulikhel, as when the major systems in the regions failed, people were forced to travel long distances to fetch water, pay higher costs to tankers and bottling companies and compromise on the basic household needs in the absence of local alternatives. As the cities in the mid-hill region source water from upstream villages, they must continually negotiate with upstream users to secure access to water. The bigger water supply projects can only be built after this contentious issue is settled through negotiations and agreements for cooperation. However, Dhulikhel’s case has shown that when the water supply system is damaged, either by disaster or other causes, these carefully negotiated agreements can be disrupted, reigniting old tensions.Bigger water supply systems offer new potentials but also disrupt old relations and customs around water. These often lead to conflicts and disparities in water access within and beyond the towns. Most emerging Nepali towns invest in bigger water supply projects with loans from international donor organisations. Users are charged higher installation costs and water tariffs to repay the loans. Once regarded as a communal service and human right, it has become a commodity traded on the market. This shift has become detrimental to the urban poor and communal tap users, raising significant concerns about people’s fundamental right to access basic water services. These sort of emerging challenges related to large-scale water supply systems in growing cities have prompted the need to reconsider approaches and explore alternative solutions for making cities more water-resilient.Diversification of water sources is a crucial strategy for cities to achieve water resilience. Several studies have highlighted the importance of small-scale and locally managed schemes. We should not underestimate these initiatives, as they can serve as lifelines during crises, ensuring water access for individuals with limited financial resources. Water managementRegarding water management, cities must prioritise self-organised community-based schemes, often more sustainable than market-oriented bigger water supply systems. The notion of community and mutual sharing in smaller schemes is more effective during the construction of new projects and in rebuilding post-disaster. Hence, different from market-based ‘payment for ecosystem services’ schemes, organically maintained upstream-downstream cooperation for water sharing, often called the reciprocal water shared agreement, could facilitate hydrosolidarity between the users. There is a pressing need for strong regulations to conserve water sources and ensure the sustainability of water infrastructures. Current practices, such as stone mining, road construction and other infrastructure building near water sources and along the pipelines, require serious reassessment. Local governments and community-based water user committees must become vigilant of these issues to promote better practices. The water supply system is a fundamental aspect of urban planning. Sustainable water management should be central to the agenda of upcoming city planning and urban development initiatives. A city-specific collaborative platform with a regular dialogue among experts, municipal leaders, and upstream and downstream water users could aid in exploring solutions for making cities water resilient.  \nTaliban regained control in Afghanistan, leading to the chaotic evacuation of Afghans (including US allies) to the US, where they face legal uncertainty and await Congressional action to determine their permanent status.\nPrime Minister Oli exhibits autocratic tendencies by seeking clarification from critics within his party, despite preaching democracy to the public.\nMcDonald's E. coli outbreak, linked to Quarter Pounder hamburgers and contaminated onions from Taylor Farms, has affected 75 individuals, hospitalizing 22, with one fatality reported.\nWeather forecast predicts partly cloudy to fair conditions in most of Nepal, with isolated rain in hilly regions, and temperatures ranging from 4.3°C to 33°C.\nAmidst street protests by opposition parties, ruling parties firmly reject any attempts to seek political alternatives outside the parliamentary process or new mandate, emphasizing the importance of democratic methods and opposing acts that promote chaos or hinder judicial investigations.\nTraffic police have reintroduced the no-horn campaign in Kathmandu Valley to combat unnecessary honking.Officers carrying placards with “no-horn” messages are stationed at various intersections, urging drivers to refrain from honking.Deputy Superintendent of Police Rabin Karki, spokesperson for the Kathmandu Valley Traffic Police Office, said the campaign aims to curb noise pollution through stricter enforcement and public awareness.Despite Kathmandu being declared a horn-free zone in April 2017, rampant horn use continues. Karki said the Vehicle and Transport Management Act prohibits honking in restricted areas, classifying it as a traffic violation.Last fiscal year, 10,123 vehicles were fined for unnecessary honking. This year, 13,003 vehicles have already faced penalties. The awareness drive was relaunched on October 17.Karki explained that while normal hearing can tolerate up to 60 decibels, 70 decibels is harmful. Noise pollution causes hearing loss, high blood pressure, heart disease, strokes, respiratory issues, and memory loss. Loud motorcycles and vehicles with modified silencers or pressure horns are major contributors. The police are focusing on violators, with particular attention to the impact on pedestrians, especially children, the elderly, pregnant women, and those with health issues, Karki said. \nAmid widespread deaths and devastation caused by monsoon across various districts, Nepal is at a heightened risk for water-borne, vector-borne, and air-borne disease outbreaks.With most water sources contaminated by rain and floodwater, and thousands of displaced people living in makeshift shelters, experts have warned of a potential surge in infections in the coming days.“People are already getting infected with water-borne, vector-borne and air-borne diseases,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “These problems could worsen in the coming days.” At least 209 people have been confirmed dead, while 29 others are still missing due to the floods and landslides triggered by record-breaking torrential rainfall that started Thursday evening. Additionally, 142 people have sustained various degrees of injury, and more than 4,222 others have been taken to safe places, the Home Ministry said on Monday evening. Doctors warn that the risk of water-borne, vector-borne and air-borne disease outbreaks increases in the aftermath of disasters. Nepal’s past experiences suggest the same.“People are already contracting cholera and other water-borne diseases,” said Dr Pun. “As displaced people mostly live in temporary shelters, the chances of spread of air-borne and vector-borne diseases remain high.”At least 95 people from various districts, including from Kathmandu and Lalitpur, have tested positive for cholera since the start of the monsoon in June. The Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool samples of the infected patients. Thousands of others were also infected with diarrheal infections after the start of the monsoon season. Diarrhoeal disease is a common and seasonal public health issue, usually triggered by unsafe food and water or hygiene issues. Likewise, six people died, and 12,644 others were hospitalised this year due to dengue, which has spread to 76 out of 77 districts across the country. Hundreds of people are contracting seasonal flu, but health authorities have no records of these cases.Officials at the Ministry of Health and Population said that they are bracing for tough days ahead, as the floodwaters not only contaminate drinking water sources but also create breeding grounds for various disease-spreading vectors.“We expect a surge in water-borne, vector-borne and air-borne diseases in the coming days, as it takes a few days for these illnesses to incubate,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “We have alerted all agencies concerned to step up vigilance and prepare to deal with any adverse situations.”Public health experts have warned that healthcare facilities in the disaster-hit districts could witness an uptick in cases of viral fever cases and waterborne diseases—diarrhoea, dysentery, food poisoning—and snakebites.Health Ministry officials say that they are aware of the risks and have directed agencies concerned to prepare accordingly.“We have stockpiled essential medicines in districts, provinces and at the central level,” said Dr Roshan Pokhrel, the secretary at the ministry. “Responding to the looming outbreaks is not only the responsibility of the Health Ministry, but also of other ministries and agencies, and we have been coordinating with them as well.”In addition to stepping up surveillance measures, stockpiling medicines, and deploying medics at the health facilities in disaster-hit areas, public health experts emphasise the importance of health awareness in reducing infections.They say a combination of careful surveys, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining hygiene and sanitation, social mobilisation and treatment are required to contain the possible outbreaks of various ailments.The monsoon in Nepal is itself a season of epidemics with thousands of people across the country getting infected with water-borne and vector-borne diseases.The country is one of the world’s most vulnerable to the climate crisis and has witnessed extreme weather events over the past decade and a half.Evidence suggests that the maximum temperature in Nepal is rising at a greater rate (0.056 degrees Celsius per year) than the global average of 0.03 degrees Celsius per year.Experts say extreme weather events—excess rainfall in a short period, continuous rains for several days after the monsoon, dry spells, droughts, below-average precipitation, and above-normal winter temperatures—have become more frequent in Nepal.In recent years, scientists have gathered credible evidence linking the climate crisis to adverse health effects that impact the quality of life and kill people. \nAs the festive season approaches, prices of daily essentials like rice, edible oil, legumes, and lentils have increased.Retailers say food prices are expected to stay high throughout Dashain and Tihar, Nepal’s biggest festivals.In Nepal, food prices are heavily influenced by the Indian market. Even though prices have not increased in India, some opportunist traders have been taking advantage of the poor market monitoring to increase prices under different pretexts. For example, on September 14, India raised the basic import tax on crude and refined edible oils by 20 percent. Nepali importers seized this opportunity to hike their prices even though Nepal had not raised the import tax.Dhurba Prasad Adhikari, joint treasurer of the Nepal Retailers Association, said Nepali wholesalers and retailers have already raised the prices. “It has been a week since edible oil price was increased by Rs20 per litre and the price is expected to increase further as the festive demand kicks in,” he said. But he admits that market rumours and weak inspections make prices more unstable, especially during the festive season when demand is at its peak.According to the association, sunflower oil prices have increased from Rs190 to Rs210 per litre. Likewise, the per litre price of mustard oil has gone up from Rs350 to Rs370.Adhikari, who operates Adhikari Khadya Store, said the price of edible oil is expected to increase in Tihar due to high demand.Retailers said strict inspections in large trading houses could help stabilise prices during the festive season. Consumer rights activists say the current government inspections of the market are just for show and will not address issues related to price, quality, and quantity.“The government’s market inspection body is looking only at retail markets. They, too, know this will not change prices unless they also inspect the warehouses of large importers and traders,” Adhikari said. He said that the government inspecting body needs to check on the stock of goods held by traders.According to retailers, even with the new rice harvesting beginning soon, prices of the staple have increased by Rs100 kg for a 25 kg bag.Even the price of sona mansuli, which normally remains at Rs60 per kg, has now inched up to Rs70 to Rs75 per kg.Rice prices, however, are expected to decline after the arrival of the new harvest.Sugar is now being sold at Rs120 per kg and expected to rise further, retailers said.As private sector traders say they are out of sugar stock and both state supply utilities—the Salt Trading Corporation and the Food Management and Trading Company—have delayed opening the tender to import the sweetener, according to market insiders, the price is expected to cross Rs160 per kg by Tihar.However, retailers said the jeera (cumin seed) price has declined. But the price could still go up in the next two weeks.Last year during Dashain, the price of jeera, an indispensable spice, spiked from Rs1,400 to Rs1,500 per kg. The price has declined, and it is being transacted around Rs950 per kg this year, Adhikari said. Prices of lentils and legumes tend to fluctuate based on international production, but have remained high in recent months.According to the association, pulses have reached Rs180 per kg from Rs175 per kg.Adhikari said food prices have been increasing every year. “The rice prices are so high that people are buying only what they need in smaller quantities,” said Adhikari.“The government needs to intervene in the market, particularly inspect the large traders engaged in unscrupulous market activities,” said Prem Lal Maharjan, president of the National Consumer Forum. “Proper inspection will help bring the prices down. It will also help the government bring in more revenues,” he said.As the government has started operating fair-price shops across the country, there might be some relief for consumers, Maharjan said. “But such subsidised shops should be operated year-round to control market prices.”    \nDean Richard Thompson recently completed his two years as the American ambassador to Nepal. Arriving here just before the 2022 elections, he has since closely observed Nepali politics and society. Umesh Chauhan and Biswas Baral recently sat down with Thompson to reflect on his time in Nepal, major US projects in the country including those under the MCC, geopolitical competition with China, trade, and a range of other issues.How have you seen Nepali politics evolve in the two years you have been in the country? What events stood out? I’ve seen a lot of Nepali politics. Obviously, there’s been a lot of changes. I got here right before the national elections in November 2022. It was really great to see the democratic process play out here, to see Nepalis turn out in such great numbers and make their choices known.Democracy is such a vibrant and colourful exercise anywhere in the world. Nepal did not disappoint on that front. It's been fascinating to watch it evolve, to watch the governments come in different formations.What’s been great is the commitment we’ve seen from successive groups in government to moving forward and carrying forward the [bilateral] partnership and building on projects. I’ve also been amazed at some of the innovative things happening in various sectors of the economy.There has been some very exciting work in the IT sector, for example, that runs the gamut from more traditional back-office type operations to cutting-edge AI research, to developing educational apps for school students, to things like what we have been sponsoring at our Content Creator’s Mela these past two years. It is great to see Nepalis show lots of creativity in expressing themselves and talking about their culture and their society in so many different ways. Across the board, I’d say the experience has been unique.How have the Nepal-US relations evolved over the past 77 years of diplomatic ties? What are the salient features of the relationship? What I would say is we’ve always tried to listen, to engage with the Nepali society. Based on that, I think one of the things that we’ve done is refine the range of products.The Peace Corps, the USAID, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, the Development Finance Corporation, or other elements of our assistance and development commitments—these are different tools that can be employed. And Nepal has continually expanded its capacity to take advantage of them. The US has been able to increase the number of tools and assets, if you will, that Nepal can use to build its economy.I’m very proud of the fact that we have done this primarily through grant-based assistance, so that there is little in terms of downsides. At the same time, we have focused on different segments of the economy or society, for example, through the Development Finance Corporation, we’re now able to target and work with the financial sector to create more opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises, particularly women-run enterprises. Through the USAID, we can use more of the traditional mechanisms of assistance.The Millennium Challenge Corporation kind of speaks for itself. It targets large-scale, massive infrastructure type projects that aim to be transformative in terms of Nepal’s economy. It has helped grow the road and infrastructure network and show new technology that can help expand that network and make roads safer, more reliable, and easier to maintain. It has helped build an electricity infrastructure that allows Nepal, first and foremost, to internally use the green hydropower that's at its disposal, but there will be excess capacity even to export it to the region to earn additional income. So I’m pretty excited about what I’ve seen happen over the past 77 years, and where we are today. I’m also extremely positive about building on where we are now. Can you give us a status of the implementation of projects under the Millennium Challenge Account Nepal? In the MCC, energy, obviously, is a high-priority area and so is transportation. Where we are with the projects themselves is we have let out the contracts for the sub-stations, for the 18-kilometre cross-border transmission line, and we have reissued the tender for the 297-kilometre broader transmission line package that had to be revised due to some cost changes over the time it took to implement that piece of the package.But we’re pretty positive about getting that back on track by the end of the year and putting the project firmly on the right footing for a five-year completion timeline. But there have also been hurdles, right? Do you still expect the transmission lines and road projects to be completed in five years?I expect there to be more hurdles. The biggest challenge was when the bids came back for the 297-kilometre transmission line. We had a number of delays there from Covid to worldwide inflation, to supply chain shifts that I don’t think people had foreseen completely. I’m not surprised. But the MCC has had a lot of experience around the world with these projects.It builds into this assumption that there will be challenges, there will be situations that need to be rethought and overcome. The real trick is making sure we move forward in a way that’s smart and focused on keeping things on time and on track. We're fortunate in the case of Nepal because we have a partner that has so heavily invested its own resources into the project.We have our $500 million grant and Nepal is putting in almost $200 million. It’s been made a national pride project. Look, other things will inevitably come up. But we believe that we have a good team that’s ready to tackle those types of challenges and press forward.At the end of the day, this can serve as a really positive model for how development assistance and how large-scale infrastructure projects can be implemented in a partnership that is largely the result of an internal domestic process. Don’t forget, Nepal requested the MCC project. The government of Nepal, through a consultative process, developed the idea, designed the project, and is now its lead implementer.We’re a financier and a partner but it is very much a Nepal-owned effort. Talking about challenges, there are many local governments and we have to deal with them every 10 to 15 kilometres in the project areas. Different communities have different concerns and priorities. This can add to some difficulty.What do you think will happen to the project if it cannot meet the five-year deadline?The fate of the project is to be completed in its entirety in five years. I can't speak to whether there’s going to be a particular challenge to delay it by six months or seven months or something like that. Right now, in our planning and projection, we hope that we can move it forward within the timeline.If it needs to go beyond that, we’ll work closely with our partner and figure it out. I’m confident that the $500 million that the US government is providing will be spent within the five years and it will lay a firm foundation for the completion of the project.But coming back to your scenario, indeed, you have different communities. A lot of people are affected by this. Now, on the one hand, that's why we encourage and insist on a consultative process, on everything being as transparent as possible so people know exactly what’s going to happen, that they know what the money is being spent on, what the effects will be in terms of how many trees will have to be cut down or what roads will be built where. That’s very important to us: no surprises for the communities that are out there.I think that we will rely on a lot of that effort to help us propel the project forward if things do get challenging on other fronts as well.Like you said, the project does need to be completed by a deadline of five years. Just in case it doesn’t, what happens?Look, it is an ambitious undertaking. There’s no question about it, right? And the Millennium Challenge Corporation is committed to making it happen within that five-year period. The MCA Nepal is committed to making it happen within that five-year period. But they’re also working closely together to make sure that it’s being done in a proper way, in a transparent way, and I’m confident that we will be able to complete what we need to complete. I’m also sure there’s a firm commitment from the government that if there’s a little piece left over here or there, to make sure it goes forward.I don’t worry about the ultimate completion of the project. I’m more focused on how we get it going as quickly as possible, because just the implementation of the project itself should employ close to 10,000 Nepalis, right? I really want communities to start to see the benefit of the project as soon as possible, because that’s where the transformative nature of it comes into play. Part of it is building it. Part of it is implementing it. Part of it is learning from that process. But then having this infrastructure in place, that’s what really changes the dynamic in Nepal and in the economic well-being of the country.Some fear that a failure to complete the project on time could even create rifts in our bilateral ties.I don’t think they should be fearful. We are partners in this, and if there’s any issue, if we're going to work through it together. What we should be doing is focusing entirely on implementing the project to its fullest potential as quickly as possible.Let’s move to geopolitics. What we see in the region is seemingly an exclusivist India-China geopolitical competition. Indians appear reluctant to work with the regimes that work closely with China. It's almost like they are saying, it's either the Chinese or us. How do you see this geopolitical dynamics playing out in Nepal? And where do the Americans fit in this picture?Yeah, it’s a good question in terms of the dynamic that’s in play today and where things are headed. We have of course been watching the India-China relationship and its development over the past few years with some degree of concern. Obviously, there was conflict there some years ago, and I think they’ve been trying to manage that since.And there’s no question that other countries in the region feel that very powerfully. From our standpoint, what we would like to see is the countries of the region—and particularly Nepal because that’s where I’m accredited and that’s where I have some level of knowledge—exercise their sovereignty and to have the space that they need to make decisions about they own future on behalf of their people in a positive way.We don’t believe countries should be asked to choose. We fully expect that Nepal is going to have good relations with India and China. They’re two neighbours. They’re large countries. They’re important countries in the region. It’s critically important for Nepal that it works with and benefits from both India and China.At the same time, we see no reason that should have any effect on our relationship with Nepal, and no reason Nepal should not be fully able to take full advantage of what the US has to offer. We will continue to watch and continue to work closely with Nepal as a partner and to encourage it to exercise its sovereignty and its decision-making in a way that benefits the Nepali people. The US-China relations are also very dicey at the moment. Surely this has some effect on how the US perceives the Chinese role around the world, including in Nepal.We had a recent high-level visit by our National Security Advisor [to China]. We’ve had recent visits by the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Treasury. I think there’s a real effort to try to manage what we all acknowledge is as a competition that’s underway, in a way that’s positive and can maybe move us more towards some type of cooperative element.That channel should continue to be pursued by the US and China, but it’s not reflective of our relationship with Nepal, or our relationship with India. This is about what we can do together [with Nepal]. I’m not going to comment on what other countries may be saying about us, how they may be trying to influence us.I would commit to us remaining as transparent as possible so Nepalis can make their own decisions about what's happening by our relationship.Recently, the Americans were blamed for ousting Sheikh Hasina from Bangladesh. The US is also often accused of meddling in the domestic affairs of other South Asian states, and in other parts of the world for that matter. How do you respond to this accusation?First off, I think you’ve got to take with a grain of salt anything that’s being said by someone who’s been forced to flee their country. The United States simply does not meddle in the internal politics of other countries. We work very hard to be as transparent as we possibly can about our relationships, about what we’re doing, about what we intend.That’s not to say that if we disagree vehemently with a country about a certain policy or a certain issue, we won’t raise it. But this idea that the US would find some benefit in enacting a change in government like that, it simply isn’t part of our repertoire of diplomacy. What we rather look to do is build the strongest relationships that we can.We love to do that primarily through people-to-people relationships and sponsoring as much development opportunity as we possibly can with our partner countries. So, I put no stock in these types of rumours and statements.There is also this sentiment that the Americans and the Indians are increasingly working together on strategic issues, and the same is seen even in South Asia.Certainly, there’s been a huge growth in the strategic partnership between the US and India. I think we want to see that continue to move forward in a positive way. At the same time, there have been disagreements between the US and India on various fronts, just as we have disagreements with many of our partners. And we try to deal with those in a proactive, professional and productive way.But, again, we see our relationship with each individual country through a bilateral lens. So if there are ways that the US and India working together can be beneficial, and another country agrees to such a cooperation, fine. But when it comes to Nepal, we’re going to base our relationship and our efforts first and foremost on our bilateral discussions and our bilateral relationship.Even as we speak, the US and Nepali armies are undertaking joint training in Nepal. How would you characterise the relations between the two armies?Yeah, the PAC ANGEL exercise is going on, focused on disaster relief, humanitarian assistance. The relationship between the two militaries has been strong, it remains strong, and I think it will continue to be strong primarily because we focus it on the areas Nepal wants to focus on—which is building a Nepal army that is capable of responding to disasters, providing humanitarian assistance, and then serving as part of the global peacekeeping network through the United Nations as the largest contributor force of peacekeepers. It’s in our interest to see Nepal continue to professionalise and develop its capacity on those fronts. That’s where our focus is, and that’s where we will continue to make efforts.There has also been a lot of debate in Nepal on the Indo-Pacific Strategy (IPS) and its applicability to South Asia. What is the current state of its application?The Indo-Pacific Strategy is a broad, big strategy by the United States government about how it looks at the entire region. And so it’s about how we create an open, independent, sovereign Indo-Pacific region for the benefit of all the people in the region.What we will continue to do is employ it to build relationships we have with each of the countries in the region. How can we continue to support democratic development? How can we continue to support economic development? Let’s not forget a huge portion, maybe 60 percent of the world’s commerce transits the Indo-Pacific corridor in some way, shape, or form every year.It’s in everyone’s interest for that to remain open and free. And for the countries of the region to be able to act in a sovereign way in their own interests.There is also a sizable section of Nepalis who believe that the IPS was brought with the intent of countering China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), and that Nepal is struggling to find a balance between the two. What is your reading?The USAID, the MCC, the Development Finance Corporation, all of our development programmes have a singular purpose, which is to work with our bilateral partners to grow their economies, to make them more able to meet the needs of their people. That’s the goal. That's how they were designed. And that’s how we will continue to treat them.The BRI is China's initiative. It’s pushing that forward. It’s up to each country to decide how it wants to engage with others. We believe the model of, say, a USAID or an MCC is proving itself to be beneficial to countries, as they are grant-based and economic growth oriented. We’ll continue to push them because we think the data and historical experience we’ve had support them.I think it’s incumbent on us to try to help all of our partners relate to us as equals in any realm that we’re working together. That’s critically important and something we have to acknowledge and something we have to make sure that they’re able to acknowledge.It's about building trust, about showing that our intent is correct, that we have the best interest of our partners in mind, and that we’re applying the same and transparent standards universally.For example, on the MCC, we’ve published everything on the internet. If anybody in Nepal has a question about any aspect of the project, they can go to the website, they can read about the project, they can see the blueprints, they can know exactly what it’s going to involve. That's how I think we build relationships.I think if I came to Nepal and said, hey, I want to do X project because I want to counter this country, I don’t think I would get very good reception. We just don’t look at the world that way. It’s not a healthy approach in the long run.But a bilateral focus that seeks to empower the people of a country—that’s where I think we have the best chance of moving forward. Nepal’s Parliament has finally passed an amendment to the transitional justice law. How does the US see this development? How do you see the transitional justice process progressing?I think this is a really important step in the process. I would say that we remain positive about the way it's going and we are looking to see how we can help. You noted, I’m sure, that we joined a number of other partner countries in issuing a statement of support after the Parliament passed it.We all know bringing a conflict of this scale to conclusion is always going to be a challenge. The TJ legislation has passed, which was a tough hurdle, but implementation will also be difficult.We’re looking forward to figuring out how we can be supportive, and how other partners can be supportive. Some of that may be through bilateral means. Some of it may be through multilateral means.But what I remain encouraged about, in particular, is, we’ve always said this needs to be a Nepali-run process. It has been. That it needs to be victim-centric. I believe that it is. And so we need to make sure the consultative piece of this remains alive as you move to implementation, so that the victims groups, so that the child soldier groups, so that other entities that have been involved continue to have a voice and continue to work together to figure out how to resolve this, to make reparations work, to bring justice in those cases. And so, we are positive.Thousands of Nepali youths are leaving the country every single day in search of better jobs. In this light, do you see the prospect of greater American FDI helping Nepal build a more robust economy that can create enough good jobs?I do. At the beginning of the interview, I talked about some sectors of the economy that are quite exciting right now. I think you’re seeing a lot of interest from the US in the IT sector, the tourism sector, in the health sector, and in the energy sector as it continues to develop.We’re very keen to look for ways to bring more US investment here, whether it’s through equity sort of vehicles, or direct bilateral investments. I think that can also be positive. I think Nepal did a good job in setting up that April Investment Summit. That sent a really positive signal. You’ll recall that we had a representative from the US Chamber of Commerce, Atul Keshap, come out for that. We’ve had a great run of senior US visitors out here over the last year and a half.I think the key right now is for Nepal, through its private sector, through its government, to figure out how to make the environment for investment in Nepal as attractive as it can possibly be. In this interview, we’ve talked about the idea of competition between countries. One place where I will absolutely acknowledge there’s competition is in trying to attract investment.And so Nepal needs to figure out how to make itself as attractive as possible, and how to make it as easy as possible to do business. That helps not only investments that come from other countries, but makes it easier for Nepalis to start businesses, right? It makes it easier for Nepalis to operate and do what they want. And so, in addition to welcoming, say, US companies or British companies or Canadian companies, we would also love to see Nepalis who have gone abroad come back and start to help in building the economy here.We’ve seen how capable and how dynamic they are in building other people’s economies. Let’s do the same here at home.I mentioned that the trade and investment framework talks that we have with Nepal are in their seventh round. I look forward to, in the rest of my tenure here, to continue to build the momentum that will allow investment to take shape and the economy here to thrive. \nHere’s what Prime Minister KP Oli told the parliament on Monday, saying he was giving the address for a “special” reason: “Nepal wants to maintain neighbourly relations as a good neighbour, not a petty, scheming neighbour…Nepal wants a similar behaviour on the part of its neighbours.”He pursued this line of argument, implying that India is wishing ill on Nepal, imposing on Nepal’s sovereignty and interfering in its independent status and policy. He then told the parliament that he would present the issue at the United Nations General Assembly.It basically amounts to saying he will complain to the UN about India’s behaviour. What a petty idea.Given his inherent character trait, PM Oli will find it difficult to develop trusted relations with India in the short term. His only option is to be diplomatic, predictable and consistent. So far, he’s not been able to do that. It does not bode well for Nepal’s foreign policy, which is the most important means of pursuing Nepal’s current priorities, including jobs, growth and climate change.Calculated relations Oli’s statement in the parliament indicates at least three things. First, his expectations from India have not been fulfilled. Second, his communications with the country have broken down. And third, he thinks India may be working to undermine his political authority.Let’s look at his expectations from the southern neighbour. Oli wants to hold high-level talks with PM Modi of India and build trusted relations.In the past two weeks, media reports and opinion pieces have discussed whether Oli would be invited to India or not. It has almost become customary in Nepal for a new prime minister to visit India first before embarking on other high-level visits. Such a custom indicates the value politicians accord to India, especially if they want their government to be stable.The second indication is that Oli is finding it difficult to communicate with people who matter in India. When you begin to communicate your feelings about India through the media, it indicates that your direct communications have either broken down or are ineffective.Behind Oli’s statement is an obvious intention to play the blame game or rally the public. India may be at fault for many things, but blaming India does not absolve him of inconsistencies on his part or the sheer inability to conduct diplomacy in a dignified manner.The third indication is even more significant. Oli has consistently promoted anti-Indian nationalism, and India finds it difficult to trust him. But would that alone be enough to undermine his government?Throughout history, India has had a significant influence on Nepal’s political process and decision-making. Through its influence on individuals who’ve received gifts, benefits, and resources, some at the highest levels, India holds significant leverage over political decision-making and, by extension, over policies and processes.An old playbookIndia’s calculated relations with the Nepali state came to the fore in August this year when Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba visited India. New Delhi turned her visit into a high-profile affair even though she was unprepared to represent Nepal’s interests. Her visit, rather than building political trust, ended up creating more mistrust between Oli and New Delhi as well as between the Foreign Ministry and the Prime Minister’s Office.Although it is a matter of speculation, there are strong grounds to argue that such a courtesy would not have been extended to someone from the CPN (UML). It generates the question, at least in the public’s mind, whether India accorded special treatment to FM Rana as a “special” individual who happened to be the foreign minister and not as a representative of Nepal.Whether real or not, the perception that India is unhappy with Oli has fuelled the notion that the current government coalition is unstable.Throughout Nepal’s modern history, whenever top leaders are forced out, they tend to seek India’s support to regain power. I have heard firsthand from top political leaders that India used to put a pre-condition: First, demonstrate that you have people's support, then we will use our leverage to help you. Thus, the political leaders would launch a political campaign and hold mass meetings throughout the country. If the broader political environment favoured a political change, then India made the additional push.Now, as Pushpa Kamal Dahal tours the country, blaming a corrupt network of power brokers, we are reminded of this old playbook. During mass meetings, an embittered Dahal frequently alleges that “middlemen, brokers, and big cronies have gotten together, and with the strength of so-called numbers, have tried to strangle truth, justice…and good governance.” He also tells the public that his government was ousted because the investigations on corruption were leading to Budhanilkantha (Deuba’s residence) and Balkot (Oli’s residence).Oli’s inherent anti-Indian streakFor Oli, an inherent anti-Indian streak in his psychological make-up and an affinity with the Communist Party of China makes rapprochement with India difficult.In the last 10 years, Oli has made countless petty statements intended to rile and irritate India. He has also accorded China greater space in Nepal.In his book, former deputy PM Kamal Thapa expresses distaste at the way Oli made an unscheduled visit to China Gezhouba Group Corporation and disappeared for one and a half hours for a private meeting with Chinese Communist Party officials during his visit to China in 2016.Another issue is the Eminent Persons’ Group report, which Oli raised during the launch of Thapa’s book. “It would be good to receive the report,” he said during the programme. He made more anti-Indian remarks at another similar event.At present, any talk of the EPG report is viewed as an irritant by India, because it has consistently sent a clear diplomatic message that the report is dead. The unwillingness of a section of the Nepali populace to accept the message, including the CPN-UML, has not gone well in India.In a recent discussion programme, a former ambassador of India to Nepal indicated that the EPG report had become a new irritant in Nepal-India relations. He said that instead of insisting on the acceptance of the report, Nepal could pursue the individual issues identified. Trends in the last two decades indicate that instead of really trying to address the outstanding issues in Nepal-India relations, Nepali leaders are just interested in politicising them and gaining personal mileage.Nepal’s relationship with India has become more and more of a paradox. Nepal’s dominant ethno-nationalism is anti-Indian. Indeed, Nepal has many unresolved issues with India, but it’s economic development hinges on closer connectivity with India, which in turn hinges on trusted political relationships and ability to untangle complex issues.Snubbed by India, Oli is now headed to the US, where he could still get to meet a lukewarm Modi. He hopes to gain stature and make an impression at several forums including the UNGA, where he is scheduled to deliver speeches. We can only wish our PM well. \nFive years ago, on September 30, 2019, when KP Sharma Oli was prime minister for the second time, the government declared the entire country open-defecation free amid much fanfare. However, years later, thousands of people from across the country are getting infected with diarrheal diseases, including scores from cholera.Rautahat is among the nine districts reporting cholera outbreaks this year. Ward 4 of Rajpur Municipality has reported over 100 cases of diarrheal infection and hospitalisation. However, the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division said only 12 people from the municipality had so far contracted cholera.“Over 100 diarrheal patients from the municipality’s ward 4 have been hospitalised,” Khusid Ahmad, a health worker at the municipality, told the Post over the phone from Rautahat. “Contaminated drinking water could be the culprit for the cholera outbreak there. Samples of drinking water collected from affected areas have been sent for lab tests.”Apart from Rautahat, eight other districts—Lalitpur, Kathmandu, Kailali, Pyuthan, Makawanpur, Rolpa, Sindhupalchok, and Achham—have also reported cholera outbreaks this year. So far, the number of diarrheal patients who have contracted cholera is 95. Interestingly, most of the districts that have witnessed outbreaks of deadly cholera this year had years ago been declared open defecation-free.The Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool samples of the infected patients. Doctors say that detected cases of cholera infection could be just the tip of the iceberg, as most positive cases are being reported from the districts with active surveillance.Public health experts say outbreaks of cholera in multiple districts, even five years after the country was declared open defecation-free, show a huge gap between official declarations and progress on the ground.They say outbreaks of diarrheal diseases, including cholera, are directly linked to drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene conditions, and the country was declared open defecation-free without improving water and sanitation conditions.“Without ensuring the quality of drinking water and sanitation, among other things, authorities rushed to declare the entire country free from open defecation,” said Dr Mingmar Gyelgen Sherpa, former director general at the Department of Health Services. “Instead of improving basic water and sanitation infrastructure, we’ve focussed too much on outbreak management, and this is the wrong approach.”Even though toilets have been built in most households, open defecation is still widespread in many places. Drinking water samples collected from various parts of the country, including from the districts of the Kathmandu Valley, have been found contaminated with faecal coliform, which means the water the public uses for drinking is unsafe. The presence of faecal coliform, a microscopic organism that thrives in the intestines of warm-blooded animals or their faeces, indicates sewage contamination in the drinking water, according to doctors.A previous study had shown that 81 percent of water samples collected in the Kathmandu Valley were contaminated with deadly microbes.“We only focussed on expanding coverage of drinking water but did not pay attention to ensuring its safety,” said Dr Meghnath Dhimal, chief researcher at the Nepal Health Research Council. “Authorities concerned must also focus on improving the quality.”Experts say improving public hygiene is essential to ensuring water quality and avoiding diarrheal ailments. Awareness drives and health education play a crucial role in changing behaviours, which requires years of investment and continuous efforts.Along with investment in health education, attention should go to building climate-resilient infrastructures for drinking water and sanitation, as water resources have been contaminated by floodwaters in many districts. The effects of climate change have increased adverse events, including floods, which in turn have contaminated the source of drinking water, making people vulnerable to infection with diarrheal ailments.“Multiple agencies of the three tiers of government and non-governmental sectors have to make more effort to prevent diarrhoea outbreaks,” said Sherpa. “But there seems to be a lack of coordination among government agencies.” The World Health Organisation also stresses on a multifaceted approach as a key to controlling cholera and reducing deaths. \n\n\nRae was the envoy to Kathmandu during the promulgation of the 2015 constitution and the subsequent blockade. In this conversation, Rae talks about the evolution of Nepal-India ties since the blockade, regional geopolitics, what the two countries get wrong about each other, how New Delhi views Nepali communist parties and the governments they lead, and the change (if any) in India’s neighbourhood policy since the start of Narendra Modi’s third term in office. \nKunwar has been the MD for just under three years. Before coming back to her homeland to join Daraz Nepal, she worked at different American companies, including Amazon, the world’s biggest e-commerce platform. In this conversation, Kunwar talks about the opportunities and challenges of running an e-commerce enterprise in Nepal, as well as the country’s overall business environment.  \nPolice have arrested Ram Bahadur Khanal, a partner of Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai, in connection with the Pokhara-based Suryadarshan Savings and Credit Cooperatives fraud case.Rai is the main accused in various cooperative fraud cases in which millions of rupees from different cooperatives were channelled to the now-defunct Gorkha Media Network. He is currently on the run.Khanal, 48, of Tanahun, who is also a shareholder in Gorkha Group of Companies Limited, was arrested by a police team from the Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) on Friday in Panipokhari, Kathmandu. He owns Nature Herbs International.According to Superintendent of Police Hobindra Bogati, spokesperson for CBI, Khanal was arrested in the same case in which former deputy prime minister and home minister Rabi Lamichhane is being investigated. Khanal has been sent to the District Police Office, Kaski, for further action. \nThe Kaski District Police Office, which is investigating Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) Chairman Rabi Lamichhane, former deputy inspector general (DIG) of Nepal Police Chhabilal Joshi, and Lila Pachhai for cooperative fraud, has now secured court’s permission to investigate them on money laundering charges as well.The Kaski District Court on Thursday granted permission to keep Lamichhane, who is also a former deputy prime minister and home minister, as well as Joshi in custody for seven more days to investigate charges of cooperative fraud, organised crime and money laundering charges. The law allows a custody of up to 90 days for investigation into money laundering charges.Earlier, on October 18, the Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) of Nepal Police apprehended Lamichhane from Kathmandu after the Kaski District Court issued an arrest warrant against him.Judge Chandrakanta Paudel’s bench on Thursday authorised extension of their detention, including that of Pachhai, who was arrested in connection with the same case. The District Police Office and Office of the District’s Attorney submitted separate reports to the court on Thursday seeking a 25-day custody remand for the investigation into cooperative fraud, organised crime and money laundering charges.Deputy Superintendent of Police Basanta Kumar Sharma, who is also the spokesperson of the District Police Office in Kaski, said that police would investigate Lamichhane, Joshi and Pachhai on money laundering charges. “Investigation on three different charges will be carried out against them,” said Sharma.On Thursday, district attorney Kamala Kafle, along with assistant district attorneys Shantidevi Sharma and Bipinraj Tiwari, argued that an additional 25-day custody period was necessary to complete the investigation. Lawyers Yubaraj Parajuli and Bed Bahadur Bista supported this request, stating that crucial documents from various government offices, institutions, and banks were yet to be obtained, and further interrogation remains pending.Senior advocates Narayan Ghimire and Hari Prasad Subedi, representing Lamichhane, advocated against the extension of the detention, as did lawmaker and advocate Sobita Gautam, and other advocates Narayan Kandel, Padmaraj Sharma, and Madhukumar Chaulagain. Advocate Jagannath Dhakal defended Joshi during the hearing.During the court session, Lamichhane, initially agitated, claimed that he had repeatedly been subjected to examinations and that the charges against him were politically motivated. The judge urged him to be calm and express his views. Lamichhane later regained his composure and expressed faith in the judicial process.Police arrested him on the recommendations of the parliamentary special probe committee formed in May to investigate crisis-ridden cooperatives. The probe committee had concluded that Lamichhane was involved in misusing millions of rupees funnelled into Gorkha Media Network from various cooperatives when he was the managing director of the now defunct media company that ran Galaxy 4K Television. This happened before he joined politics in June 2022.After receiving the report, Speaker Devraj Ghimire of the House of Representatives a month ago directed the government to implement the report’s recommendations and a Cabinet meeting instructed the state agencies concerned to take necessary action as per the probe committee’s recommendations.Meanwhile, RSP leaders and activists intensified their protest after the court extended Lamichhane’s custody remand for seven more days. The protesters defied prohibitory orders imposed by the Kaski administration.The protesters and security personnel clashed after the former entered the prohibited area. The RSP supporters who staged demonstrations at Wai Chowk entered the prohibitory area and marched towards Sahid Chowk through Rastrabank Chowk.The demonstrators chanted slogans against the KP Sharma Oli-led government accusing it of taking political revenge against the RSP Chairman Lamichhane. They claimed that the government misused state powers to frame Lamichhane on false charges.Rupandehi Court also permits detaining Lamichhane, Joshi on organised crime chargesRupandehi District Court on Thursday granted permission to detain Lamichhane, GB Rai and Joshi for investigation on cooperative fraud and organised crime charges. The court also granted permission to police to arrest nine others who were allegedly involved in embezzling funds of Butwal-based Supreme Saving and Credit Cooperative.The single bench of judge Shyam Prasad Shrestha issued the permission to arrest them. Lamichhane and Joshi are in police custody in Kaski while Rai is on the run. Joshi was brought to Rupandehi a few days ago, where they spent 13 hours recording his statement before he was sent back to Kaski.According to a police source, preparations are on to bring Lamichhane to Rupandehi on Friday for testimony.A total of Rs780 million deposited in Supreme Saving and Credit Cooperative by 10,391 depositors was embezzled, according to reports. An investigation revealed that Rs142.9 million from Supreme’ funds was transferred to the Gorkha Media Network's bank account. Police earlier filed a case against 28 people including Rai, Joshi and Om Prakash Gurung. The Rupandehi District Court sent Gurung, the chairman of the Butwal-based Supreme Saving and Credit Co-operative, to jail for judicial custody on charges of misusing cooperative funds.Gurung, who has been accused of embezzling Rs1.078 billion of savings deposited by over 10,000 members at the Rai-led cooperative, was sent to jail by judge Shriprakash Upreti. However, the court released six others, including Dipesh Pun, the son of former Vice President Nanda Bahadur Pun, who were also accused of embezzling cooperatives cash. \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli has warned his opponents against ‘daydreaming’ of toppling the government.Presenting the achievements of the government’s 100 days in office, the prime minister on Wednesday said that any attempts to break up the coalition of the two largest parties—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—from power would be futile.Opposition parties, however, claim that the Oli government has been a total failure and is only focussed on protecting the corrupt.“Some are spreading rumours that the government could collapse anytime—today or tonight or by next morning,” said Oli. “These rumours are aimed at undermining the government’s functioning.”The prime minister also claimed that the government has good rapport with the bureaucracy. He also asserted that the economy is showing signs of improvement and that the government is not going to compromise on issues like national interest, good governance and development. “The economy was in chaos when we joined the government. Today there are signs of improvement. Confidence in the private sector has increased, and as per their demand, the government has formed the Economic Reform Commission,” he said.Earlier this month, the government announced a five-member high-level commission led by former finance secretary Rameshore Khanal to recommend reforms to revitalise the economy.Meanwhile, leaders from opposition parties have drawn the attention of President Ramchandra Paudel towards the ‘wrongdoings’ of the government.A group of leaders including CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who is also the leader of the main opposition in the House of Representatives, on Wednesday met the President. Their meeting came two days after they submitted a 13-point memorandum to Prime Minister Oli warning him against, among other things, revising the Political Party Act, allegedly to facilitate party splits, through an ordinance.The leaders urged the President to play a role of guardian and the custodian of the constitution while stating that the government was scheming against the constitution and pluralism, said Kiran Pokharal, press adviser to the President.The President assured them that he was committed to fulfilling his constitutional duties and would work for national unity, Pokharel said. However, an opposition leader who participated in the meeting told the Post that the President explained to them about the limitations of a constitutional head of state. “You know well about the limitations of my office. If the government forwards any such ordinance, I will consult you all on the matter,” the leader quoted the President as saying.Leaders from the Rastriya Swatantra Party, Rastriya Prajatantra Party, CPN (Unified Socialist) and Aam Janata Party accompanied Dahal during the visit.The opposition parties have accused Prime Minister Oli of preparing to ease the split of other political parties by amending the Political Party Act-2017 through an ordinance. Oli, however, has denied the claims.Opposition leaders, meanwhile, took aim at the government, accusing it of spending its first 100 days protecting corrupt individuals.“The government has completed 100 days, and it has proven exactly what we feared when it was formed,” said Maoist Centre Chairman Dahal while receiving a memorandum from the Nepal Intellectual Organisation, which is affiliated to the Maoist Centre, on Wednesday.“Ruling party members, civil society groups and even some people within the government have voiced dissatisfaction with the government’s performance,” Dahal said.Other opposition party leaders have also expressed similar frustrations at ‘the poor performance of the government’.In his address to the nation on Wednesday, the prime minister said that the government was committed to reining in corruption from any time.“The government has begun action against cooperatives fraud. Over 600 people have already been prosecuted and as many as 575 are in jail,” he said.But Oli avoided mentioning the arrest of Rabi Lamichhane, the president of the Rastriya Swatantra Party who is currently in police custody on charges of misusing funds from credit cooperatives in Kaski, Rupandehi, and Chitwan districts.“Besides taking legal action, we are also trying to set up a cooperative authority in order to ensure that depositors get their money back, as well as a cooperative credit information centre, and credit tribunal to provide justice to the victims of cooperatives fraud,” said the prime minister.He went on to claim that 70 percent of the government’s planned tasks have already been completed within the first 100 days. He took office on July 15. Just three weeks ago, over 391 people were killed in floods and landslides across the country. Two days of continuous rainfall across the country caused extensive damage to both private and public property, including roads, highways, and several infrastructure projects.The 391 bereaved families have received Rs200,000 each in compensation, and an additional Rs40.5 million has been distributed to another 2,555 families affected by the disaster, the prime minister said. The government has allocated Rs430 million to flood-affected 71 local units around the country, he said.He also claimed that the government was working “on a war footing” to rebuild the damaged infrastructure, including bridges and highways, and disbursed millions of rupees in various districts to carry out the reconstruction work, repairing the bridges and highways, among others. The prime minister also stated that the government has left no stone unturned to compensate the victims of last November’s earthquake in Jajarkot, West Rukum, Bajhang, Bajura and Doti districts.Speaking about other sectors, the prime minister said that over three million farmers in 35 districts had not received payments for their milk supplies, but his government has provided half of the farmers their outstanding payments in the 100 days. He also said the government has released the dues to 75,000 sugarcane farmers.Highlighting the achievements of his government, the prime minister claimed that his government has secured chemical fertilisers for the upcoming winter, released Rs800 million for agriculture insurance, and paid Rs6.75 billion dues to contractors. It also provided startup funds to 165 youths for innovative ventures. Likewise, the government has received Rs34 billion in commitment for setting up various industrial units, the share market has rebounded, and Nepal’s sovereign credit ratings evaluation is in its final stage, the prime minister added. Earlier in the morning, the ruling parties held a meeting to evaluate the performance of the government and discuss contemporary issues. At the meeting, the ruling coalition emphasised the need for an impartial investigation into the cooperatives scam.The prime minister’s secretariat said the coalition parties have agreed to issue separate statements calling for fair judicial proceedings and adherence to democratic norms. RSP chair and former home minister Rabi Lamichhane was arrested by a Central Investigation Bureau team from his party office in Kathmandu on Friday and subsequently taken to Pokhara for trial for cooperatives fraud and organised crime.A complaint has been registered at the Kaski District Police Office accusing Lamichhane of misusing millions of rupees from a Pokhara-based cooperative. RSP leaders, activists, and supporters have staged demonstrations in Pokhara and other places for the past few days, demanding the release of its chairman, Lamichhane. Lamichhane and several others are accused of misappropriating funds from the Pokhara-based Suryadarshan Savings and Credit Cooperative. His arrest followed a parliamentary probe that linked him and others to the embezzlement of millions of rupees from the cooperative. The probe panel submitted its report a month ago and the government had immediately decided to implement its findings.  \nIn the past few days, there has been a lot of speculation about an ordinance on the Political Parties Act-2017.Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, who is also the chair of the CPN-UML, has been trying to convince leaders from his own party as well as the chief of the major coalition partner Nepali Congress, Sher Bahadur Deuba, of the need to bring the ordinance. But other leaders, mainly from opposition parties, have strongly objected to the government’s alleged plans to introduce it. They have publicly criticised the government for what they called plans to ease the criteria for splitting parties in order to help dissident groups in various political parties. These groups have been waiting for an opportune time to form new outfits or defect to bigger ones.As Oli seems determined to bring the ordinance, Congress leaders are either divided or indecisive, according to multiple leaders the Post spoke with.The issue was extensively discussed during the opposition parties’ meeting convened by CPN (Maoist Centre) on Friday. Almost all the leaders in attendance proposed to strongly oppose the government plan. However, Oli looks determined to press ahead with a revision of the Act. He also briefed his party’s top leaders on the issue during a meeting of the party’s central secretariat on Sunday. After Prime Minister Oli also talked about the plan to soon introduce the ordinance, CPN (Unified Socialist) chair Madhav Kumar Nepal warned of consequences on Monday. Addressing a Lumbini Province-level meeting of the Unified Socialist in Kapilvastu on Monday, party chair Nepal warned Prime Minister Oli against bringing such an ordinance. Nepal said Oli will face backlash if he tried to split other parties. “The government will have to face the consequences. Be careful; those who think they can finish others will ultimately finish themselves. World history shows this. Hitler, who dreamed of conquering the world, was alone when he died. Therefore, abandon the Hitler style,” Nepal said while addressing the meeting.“During the brief meeting of the party secretariat, Oli had discussed the ordinances related to political parties,” a UML leader confided to the Post. However, the party's vice chair, Yubraj Gyawali, denied this. The secretariat meeting was focused on the party's internal matters, Gyawali said.“If there were any discussions about the ordinance with the leader of the main coalition partner, we are unaware of it,” Gyawali told the Post. “But during the party’s secretariat meeting, there was no discussion on it.” Soon after the party’s secretariat meeting, Oli met Sher Bahadur Deuba, the president of the Nepali Congress, the senior coalition partner, on Sunday evening. The two leaders also reportedly discussed the ordinance. Congress spokesperson Prakash Saran Mahat also said that the ordinance issue might have come up during the meeting between the two leaders. “However, the Congress is not ready for it,” he said. “If the ordinance related to the political parties is to be brought, it should be done with consensus among the major parties,” Mahat told the Post. “The chances of bringing an ordinance without a broad consensus are low.”Some provisions of the Political Parties Act-2017 that were nullified through an ordinance three years ago have not been revived or replaced, thereby creating a legal void over registering a new outfit by splitting a party.The Act has a provision that defines criteria under which dissidents of a political party can split the organisation and form a new outfit if they can prove the support of a certain number of central committee members and lawmakers of the mother party.Before the introduction of the ordinance in 2021, the Act had a provision that made it mandatory for a dissident group to show support of 40 percent of central committee members and 40 percent of lawmakers from the mother party to split to form a new one.But the Congress-Maoist Centre government led by Deuba issued an ordinance easing the process to split a party. The ordinance said a dissident group having support of 20 percent of central committee members or 20 percent of the party’s lawmakers could quit the mother party and register a new one.The then UML leader Madhav Kumar Nepal split the mother party and formed the CPN (Unified Socialist) based on the same provision of the ordinance. Also, a group led by Mahantha Thakur of Janata Samajbadi Party followed suit.Three years after the party’s formation, a group of leaders from the Unified Socialist are said to be waiting for an opportune time to return to the mother party, the UML. The party’s former secretary Ram Kumari Jhakri, lawmakers Krishna Kumar Shrestha, among others, are reportedly in favour of rejoining the UML, the second-largest party in the House of Representatives. The Nepal-led party has 10 seats in the lower house.Some leaders from the party accused Oli of trying to split their party by helping dissident groups to split the organisation through ordinance. The Unified Socialist has witnessed a serious factional feud following the election of office bearers and politburo members in August. Although the party concluded its general convention on July 5, the election of office bearers and politburo members was conducted later, only to create new rifts. “To cash in on our internal problems, some forces want to split our party.\" Unified Socialist spokesperson Jagannath Khatiwada told the Post. “For that, the government may bring an ordinance related to the political parties.” There are also rumours in the political circles that the UML leadership might also be working to merge into the UML the group of seven lawmakers of the Janata Samajbadi Party, led by Ashok Rai, which was formed in May after splitting with the Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal. This will make the UML the largest party in the House of Representatives. The Election Commission gave the Rai-led splinter group recognition as a new party, but the decision has been challenged in the court and the case is sub judice. And the party has been unable to expand its organisation due to the legal question about its recognition. Currently, the Congress is the largest party in the House with 88 seats, while the UML has 78 lawmakers (excluding the Speaker). If the dissidents from the Unified Socialist and Rai-led group join the UML, it may become the largest party surpassing the Congress. “How can Congress allow the government to bring the ordinance to make UML the biggest party in Parliament?” Mahat, the Congress spokesperson, questioned. “There are indeed discussions on the ordinance, but it is not necessarily that these discussions yield concrete results.” The Political Party (Second Amendment) Bill was sent to the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee in February. After discussion in the committee, the bill was forwarded to the House for the endorsement. However, the then deputy prime minister and home minister Rabi Lamichhane withdrew the bill from the House, said the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee chair, Ram Hari Khatiwada.Khatiwada, a Congress lawmaker, also thinks the ordinance is unlikely to be introduced. Khatiwada said Prime Minister Oli might have discussed ordinance-related issues with Congress President Deuba, and the UML might have also held internal discussions at its secretariat meeting on Sunday. “But it is unimaginable to think a coalition formed for political stability will create chaos by introducing the ordinance and splitting political parties,” Khatiwada told the Post. “Further, if the ordinance is brought, it should be tabled by the Minister of Law, and I don’t think the minister wants to do so.” Minister for Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs, Ajay Chaurasiya, also denied the possibility of bringing such an ordinance. “If the ordinance is to be introduced, the ministry I am leading should take the agenda to the Cabinet,” Chaurasiya told the Post. “No one till date has suggested that such an ordinance be brought.” The regular Cabinet meeting on Monday was expected to discuss the ordinance related to the political parties. However, the meeting was cancelled at the last minute.Meanwhile, leaders of five opposition parties, while submitting a memorandum to the prime minister on Monday evening, have warned Oli “not to issue any ordinance with a plan to split other parties” with the goal of “imposing a totalitarian two-party system”.Maoist Centre chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, Unified Socialist chair Nepal, Rastriya Prajatantra Party chair Rajendra Lingden, vice-chair Dol Prasad Aryal of Rastriya Swatantra Party, and Aam Janata Party chief Prabhu Sah submitted the 13-point memorandum. The prime minister had tried to allay their concerns by assuring them that he had no plans to introduce such an ordinance, according to Lingden. \nAs the Kathmandu Valley’s air quality is set to deteriorate in the coming days, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City is gearing up to start vehicle emission testing.For this, the city office has purchased a smoke meter (a portable device for testing vehicle emissions), which will be used in coordination with other stakeholders—the Metropolitan Traffic Police Division, the Department of Transport Management, and the Department of Environment.“Vehicle emission testing is mainly the responsibility of the agencies under the federal government, but the constitution has also given local governments the authority to take measures to reduce pollution,” said Sarita Rai, chief of the Environment Department. “We also have developed pollution control guidelines as per the KMC Environment and Natural Resources Protection Act-2021.”Officials say vehicle emission testing will start once the pollution control guidelines are published in the metropolis gazette. In the first phase, emissions of petrol and diesel vehicles operating in the metropolis will be randomly tested, and the city office has also planned to carry out emission testing for motorcycles.Emission testing will be carried out on vehicles that have passed emission testing from the Department of Transport Management and received green stickers. Officials say that vehicles with green stickers could still emit black smoke for various reasons, including lack of timely servicing and maintenance.“We have seen many vehicles with green stickers emitting black smoke,” an official at the Environment Department of the KMC said, asking not to be named as the official is not authorised to talk to the media. “Many automobile owners only service their vehicles ahead of the annual pollution testing.” Officials say that the amount of the fine will be determined based on the suggestions of stakeholders.Vehicle emission testing is among the measures the city office has been taking to reduce pollution levels in the metropolis.The KMC has also started independently monitoring the city's air quality, with support from the Partnership for Healthy Cities, which has provided 19 portable devices to the city office.The Partnership for Healthy Cities is a global network of 74 cities, including the Kathmandu metropolis, committed to saving lives by preventing noncommunicable diseases and injuries. The programme is supported by Bloomberg Philanthropies in partnership with the World Health Organisation and Vital Strategies.Nepal’s air quality reaches hazardous levels several times a year during winter and summer, and the capital city often ranks as the world’s most polluted metropolis. Major hospitals also report a spike in respiratory problems due to the impact of toxic air and dust. Doctors warn that people get sick from respiratory illnesses caused by polluted air throughout the year, due to polluted air.Doctors say air pollution is known to cause various respiratory illnesses. Poor air quality can cause short- and long-term effects on public health. In the short term, it can lead to pneumonia, bronchitis, conjunctivitis, skin allergy, stroke, and heart problems, and in the long run it can lead to severe conditions like ulcers, and cancer of the lungs and intestine, kidney disease, and heart complications.People in low- and middle-income countries get disproportionately affected by the polluted air, which accounts for more than 90 percent of deaths, according to the World Health Organisation.Several studies carried out in the past in Nepal show that toxic air takes a huge toll on public health. Along with respiratory illness, the toxic air has led to severe conditions like ulcers, cancer of the lungs and intestine, kidney disease, heart complications, high blood pressure and stroke, according to experts.The report, titled “Global burden and strength of evidence for 88 risk factors in 204 countries and 811 subnational locations, 1990–2021: A systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2021,” finds that air pollution was the leading contributor to the global disease burden in 2021, making for eight percent of total disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), followed by high blood pressure (7.8 percent). The report was published in The Lancet, a leading international medical journal.Studies carried out in the past show that polluted air has been shortening people’s lives. Nepali lives are being cut short by around five years, according to a report by the Air Quality Life Index (AQLI), which converts air pollution concentration into an impact on life expectancy. AQLI is a metric produced by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago.Toxic air is deadlier than tobacco use and high blood pressure, which reduce life by 2.8 years and 1.7 years, respectively, according to the report.Environment experts in Nepal often point out that worsening air quality has not only affected people’s health but also hit the economy and hindered overall development of the country. \nTicket bookings for public transport during the Dashain festival will open this Saturday. Following discussions with stakeholders, the Department of Transport Management announced that tickets will be available online and at counters to manage the expected surge of nearly two million travellers leaving the Kathmandu Valley for the festivities.According to the department’s Director General, Rajiv Pokharel, transport operators will facilitate online bookings. “We have instructed operators to arrange online bookings wherever possible,” he said. “For counter bookings, passengers must obtain tickets only from official staff wearing uniforms and identification badges.”Around two million people are estimated to leave the Kathmandu Valley during Dashain. The department has introduced 20-point directives to ensure safe and hassle-free travel. Key measures include mandatory checks for alcohol consumption by drivers at major entry and exit points and the requirement for two drivers on long-distance routes. Additionally, those under 18 cannot work as assistant drivers.To assist travellers during Dashain, Tihar, and Chhath festivals, citizen help desks will be established at major locations such as Nagdhunga, Kalanki, Swayambhu, Halchowk, Machhapokhari, Gongabu Bus Park, Chabahil, Tilganga, Koteshwar, Jagati, Satdobato, Balkhu, Dakshinkali, Sundhara, and Sangha in Kavre. An inspection team comprising officials from various agencies will monitor travel arrangements with support from provincial transport ministries.Public transport operating on long and medium-distance routes must follow a designated queue system. Transport expert Ashish Gajurel noted that although bookings are open each year, passengers face difficulties. \"Bus operators don’t increase the number of buses during Dashain, despite rising demand. Authorities must increase the number of buses to ease travel,\" he said.Saroj Sitaula, senior vice-president of the Federation of Nepalese National Transport Entrepreneurs, however, argued that ‘unnecessary’ vehicle checks should be avoided to prevent inconvenience for passengers and drivers. He also highlighted the need to repair potholes on roads to ensure smooth travel.Earlier, Minister for Physical Infrastructure and Transport Devendra Dahal instructed the Department of Roads to complete road repairs nationwide before Ghatasthapana, the first day of the 15-day Dashain festival. The department reported that repairs are underway but have been delayed by the monsoon.The Narayanghat-Butwal road section, part of the East-West Highway, remains a major concern, with only 52.7 percent of its upgrade completed after six years of construction and multiple deadline extensions. The Meteorological Forecasting Division of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology has predicted chances of rainfall in various places of the country for a couple of days more, raising concerns about travel difficulties during Dashain. Other problematic sections include Nagdhunga-Mugling and Mugling-Pokhara, with landslides and potholes reported along various highways, including the Mid-Hill, Madan Bhandari, Hulaki, and BP highways. \nPanic gripped locals in ward 12 of Chandragiri Municipality, Kathmandu, on Thursday morning after a suspicious object was found in the locality.The suspicious object was spotted in front of Balambu Secondary School, sparking fears of a bomb threat.Locals informed the police, and a bomb disposal team from the Nepal Army arrived at the scene. According to the NA Directorate of Public Relations and Information, the team disposed of the suspicious object, which turned out to be a pressure cooker.   \nKathmandu Metropolitan City has extended the area to prohibit building any structure on either side of the rivers in its territory.In a notice on Wednesday, the city office stated that construction of any structure has been barred on the additional 20 meters from the existing prohibited area.According to the metropolis notice, if the city has, under the existing rule, prohibited any construction on 20 meters from the area marked as river, the prohibited area will now be altogether 40 meters on either side of the waterway.The metropolis said the decision was taken based on a recent Supreme Court verdict that directed the authorities concerned to prohibit construction within an additional 20 metres from riverbanks in the Kathmandu Valley.Currently, construction is permitted only 20 metres beyond major riverbanks in the Kathmandu metropolis.The notice issued by the metropolis states, “No construction will be permitted on an additional 20 metres of land on either side of the river, and ongoing construction will be halted.”It has also asked one and all not to release contaminated water, including sewage, into Bagmati River and its tributaries. “Private and government buildings, as well as commercial properties, must install soak pits for groundwater recharge,” it said. “Waste must not be disposed of in the rivers. Non-compliance will lead to legal action under existing laws.” \n\nNIMB officially launched Nepal’s first Visa Wearable Sticker, branded as NIMB Paywear, at an event held in Kathmandu on Thursday.The groundbreaking payment solution, which allows customers to make secure contactless transactions by tapping a wearable device at any POS terminal, was unveiled in Nepal, marking a new era for digital payments.In the presentation, the bank highlighted how NIMB Paywear is designed to speed up, simplify, and secure daily transactions, offering customers an alternative to carrying physical cards or mobile wallets.“NIMB Paywear is a game-changer for the Nepali market,” said Mahesh Sharma Dhakal, senior deputy CEO of NIMB. “This product will transform how our customers make payments, offering them unparalleled convenience and speed while ensuring the highest levels of security. We are excited to be the first Bank in Nepal to introduce this technology, once again positioning NIMB as a leader in digital innovation.”NIMB Paywear allows users to attach the wearable sticker to any personal item, such as watches, keychains, or phone cases, making it highly versatile and convenient. Users can pay by tapping the device at any contactless POS terminal, perfect for quick and secure everyday transactions.In compliance with Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) regulations, contactless payments above Rs5,000 will require a PIN, adding an extra layer of security for high-value transactions. To celebrate the launch, NIMB announced an exciting promotional offer. Customers who apply for and activate their NIMB Paywear stickers within the first three months will have their wearable fee of Rs1,000 refunded upon completing 12 POS transactions within that period.  \nCan paddy yield be predicted two months before harvest?A new research finds this possible.A groundbreaking study combining advanced remote sensing technology with machine learning shows promising results for predicting paddy yield two months before harvest.The study uses solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), which directly measures plants' photosynthetic activity, offering real-time insights into their health and stress levels. This differs from traditional methods, which rely on canopy characteristics like greenness and often miss important physiological changes in plants. “SIF gives us a clearer picture of crop potential, especially under stressful environmental conditions,” said Manoj Lamichhane, a PhD student at South Dakota State University in the US, one of the study's authors.The study presents a robust data-driven approach to predicting rice yield in Nepal by integrating SIF with traditional remote sensing and environmental data. A key strength of the research is utilising a multi-source dataset, which includes SIF, and biophysical, climatic and soil variables. The study provides valuable insights into paddy yield prediction by exploring various time windows in machine learning models for growing periods of these variables.Analysis revealed that soil variables, mainly sand and P2O5, are the most critical factors in predicting paddy yield. Climatic properties, vegetation indices, and SIF variables such as precipitation and water deficit follow them. According to the research, integrating SIF with traditional remote sensing and environmental variables reduces the prediction error by 21 percent. “When tested on unseen data, our model accurately predicted rice yield across all districts in Nepal, aligning closely with observed data. This fitted model can predict paddy yield using features from July to September,” according to the study. “Given that the rice harvest in Nepal occurs in November, yield predictions can be made as early as two months before harvest, providing valuable lead time for decision-making.”The study said that future research could explore applying this approach in other major paddy-producing countries across Southeast Asia to evaluate its effectiveness and adaptability to different regional conditions.Experts say new research conducted in the Tarai offers hope for improving agricultural productivity and food security in Nepal, where rice plays a vital role in the diet, rural income, and economic growth. The plains account for 71 percent of Nepal’s total paddy acreage, the hills for 25 percent, and the mountain region for 4 percent.Paddy is Nepal’s biggest earning farm commodity, with tens of thousands of farmers relying on its income. According to economists, the high output may cool down inflation and pump up the economy.Paddy production in Nepal, particularly in the Tarai belt, faces increasing challenges due to climate change and unpredictable weather patterns, which can severely impact yields. Using machine learning models, researchers say they can predict rice yields based on various environmental factors, such as rainfall, temperature, and soil conditions. The study's findings underscore the importance of adequate rainfall during August and September. “Our research shows that rainfall during these critical months directly influences yields. This means that efficient water management during this period is crucial,” said Dr Sushant Mehan, assistant professor at South Dakota State University.Soil health also emerged as a key factor in the study. The research highlights the importance of maintaining phosphorus levels, a nutrient essential for rice growth. “Farmers should regularly test their soil and apply the necessary fertilisers, particularly phosphorus-based ones,” added Mehan, emphasising the need for sustainable soil management practices.This research has significant implications not only for farmers but also for policymakers. By providing early yield predictions, the study enables better planning for food security and supply chains, helping to avert potential shortages. Rajendra Uprety, a rice expert, told the Post that early yield predictions could primarily benefit a country like Nepal. For instance, according to Uprety, farmers will be encouraged to insure their paddy based on early yield predictions. “Besides, if farmers know that they are getting a good yield two months before the harvest, they can increase investment in paddy. The investment will enable farmers to adopt commercial farming from the subsistence farming method.”Since paddy output is directly linked to the country’s economic growth, the government and policymakers can accurately forecast the country's economic growth, including inflation. “Low output means it will put pressure on the price, and accordingly, the government can plan for imports,” said Uprety. “Thus, prices will remain stable.”He said that neighbouring India has recently lifted the ban on the export of rice following a projection that it will have a bumper rice harvest this year. On September 28, the Indian government lifted the non-basmati white rice export ban. This change follows a prohibition to enhance domestic supply since July 20, 2023.“Early prediction will enable Nepal, just like India, to know what Nepal’s requirement is in case of low production,” said Uprety. “These early predictions allow farmers and the government to prepare in advance, ensuring that enough rice is available even during years of low production,” said Sagar Kafle, assistant professor at Tribhuvan University, one of the study's authors.“As climate change continues to impact agriculture in Nepal, this study offers a roadmap for increasing resilience in rice production. The findings could play a crucial role in helping Nepal maintain stable paddy yields, securing both livelihoods and food supplies for the country’s population.”Despite the El Niño phenomenon, Nepali farmers harvested a record 5.72 million tonnes of paddy in the last fiscal year, ended mid-July.Paddy production grew 4.33 percent year-on-year. The country has 1.43 million hectares of land suitable for growing paddy. The grain is generally planted twice a year—in June and March. However, spring paddy is planted only on 104,712 hectares. According to the agriculture ministry, paddy's contribution to the country’s gross domestic product amounts to 4 percent. \nTravellers on international airlines will soon benefit from higher compensation limits. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) announced that the Montreal Convention liability limits for death, injury, delays, baggage, and cargo issues will increase on December 28, 2024. Nepal implemented the Montreal Convention for the first time on December 15, 2018. Millions of air passengers worldwide are entitled to compensation for yearly flight delays, cancellations, and overbooking. Because passengers are unaware of their rights and airlines make it so hard to get their money, less than 2 percent receive their flight compensation, according to a study. Here is what you need to know about the Montreal Convention and your air passenger rights. Claim what you owe.What is the Montreal Convention 1999 or MC99?The Montreal Convention is a multilateral treaty adopted by a diplomatic meeting of International Civil Aviation Organisation member states in 1999. Ratified in 1999 and enacted in 2003, the Montreal Convention was a successor to the Warsaw Convention 1929.Formally known as the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air, the Montreal Convention 1999 (or MC99) has established a comprehensive and unified framework for the international carriage of passengers, baggage, and cargo by air. It introduced several elements to balance the interests of travellers, cargo shippers, and the aviation industry. The Convention sets liability limits for airlines, ensuring fair compensation for consumers in cases of injury, death, delay, baggage and cargo issues. ICAO has informed the 140 State Parties that the limits will increase in line with the Convention’s built-in review mechanism, which adjusts for inflation every five years. This ensures that passenger and cargo compensation remains appropriate over time. This is the fourth review since the treaty came into force in 2003. \"ICAO continues to advocate for the universal ratification of MC99,\" said Juan Carlos Salazar, the ICAO secretary general, in a statement. \"This Convention is fundamental in protecting consumer interests in international air travel. By promoting harmonisation and codification of rules governing international carriage by air, MC99 benefits passengers and cargo shippers while enabling the unified and equitable development of air services.\"What are the liability provisions?The liability limits are indicated in Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), a unit of account defined by the International Monetary Fund. For indicative purposes, 1 SDR has been valued at US$ 1.33318 on October 18, 2024. What are the revisions? The limits will be revised as follows: 1. The death or bodily injury limit will increase from 128,821 SDRs to 151,880 SDRs (about US$202,500). It originally was 100,000 SDRs in 2003. 2. The limit for passenger transport delays will rise from 5,346 SDRs to 6,303 SDRs (about US$8,400). 3. The limit for baggage destruction, loss, damage, or delay will increase from 1,288 SDRs to 1,519 SDRs (about US$2,000). 4. The limit for cargo destruction, loss, damage, or delay will rise from 22 SDRs to 26 SDRs per kilogram (about US$35). ICAO has invited the States Parties to MC99 to make provisions as necessary in accordance with their domestic legal requirements, to give full effect to the revised limits as of December 28, 2024.What’s the case of Nepal?The Montreal Convention allows air passengers on international flights to claim compensation for damages caused by travel disruptions and luggage problems. Since travellers in Nepal are not aware that they can file a compensation claim, many passengers protest at the airport against the delays, cancellations, baggage damages and other issues caused by the airlines' negligence. For example, if the passengers' baggage is damaged, under the rule, passengers can claim up to $2,000 with the particular airline.However, the Montreal Convention waives the airline’s liability in cases where extraordinary circumstances caused the flight disruption. Such cases include adverse weather, Air Traffic congestion and restrictions, lightning strikes, bird strikes, strikes at the airport, medical emergencies, security threats, and political unrest, etc. You can also claim when … ?On November 30 last year, Flight RA229 of the state-owned Nepal Airlines flew two hours before its scheduled departure, leaving 31 passengers stranded at midnight at Kathmandu’s Tribhuvan International Airport. The reason for the rushed departure was the flight’s VVIP status. Then-prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal was on the same flight. The flight was planned for Dahal, who left for Dubai leading the Nepali delegation to the 28th Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 28). According to experts, the case is severe negligence by the airline company, and passengers can still file compensation cases as per the Convention.The MC99 extends a time frame within which a passenger can claim compensation for damages – up to two years following the occurrence of the flight disruption. If the claim pertains to damaged, lost, or delayed luggage, it's imperative to report the issue expeditiously. Claims for damaged baggage should be filed within seven days, while claims for delayed baggage must be initiated within 21 days. If your bags remain unclaimed for more than 21 days and are considered lost, you still can file a claim within two years.Where to file the claims?According to Vijay Shrestha, vice-president of administration at Himalaya Airlines, passengers can file a compensation claim by filling out a “property irregularity form” at the airline office or the airline’s ground handling agent in any destination airport.Luggage will be categorised as lost if the airline cannot trace it for 21 days from filing the property irregularity report. All claims shall be substantiated with an itemised list of contents, description, age, and proof of purchase or ownership of all items. At Kathmandu airport, passengers can file compensation claims for loss, delay, or damage at the lost and found unit of Nepal Airlines. “The compensation provision used to be printed on tickets, but since airlines issue e-tickets nowadays, passengers can go to the ‘contract of carriage by air’ on the airline's website to know the information regarding the loss, delay, or damage,” said Shrestha. Is MC99 applicable to domestic airlines? The MC99 makes only international airlines liable in case of passenger death or injury.A year after Nepal adopted the MC99, preparations for adopting a similar law started but could not proceed, although the draft had been prepared.Tourism ministry officials say the process was stalled multiple times as governments changed. Since 2019, there have been six fatal plane and helicopter crashes that killed 130 people, and all the families of the victims have been barred from a justifiable compensation that would be $100,000 as per the proposed provisions.The air carriers’ liability and insurance draft bill for domestic airlines has been sent to the finance ministries for their comments before being tabled by the Cabinet. After the Cabinet nod, the bill will be tabled in Parliament.What’s the provision in the proposed domestic law? As per the planned law, domestic airlines have to pay a minimum compensation of $100,000 for the injury or death of a passenger. Currently, the minimum compensation for passenger death on a domestic flight is $20,000.According to the proposed law, a compensation claim should be filed with the airline or its agents within 60 days of the incident or accident. The carrier’s liability limitation for cargo lost and damaged shall be $20 per kg if the damage was caused or contributed to by the negligence of the airlines, it says. The cargo damage is limited up to $5,000.The compensation for the hand baggage, if lost or damaged, shall be $400.Under the Montreal Convention 1999, effective as of December 28, 2019, a carrier’s liability limitation for cargo lost, damaged or delayed shall be 22 SDRs per kg ($29.21 per kg) in the case of destruction, loss, damage or delay concerning cargo carriage.Carriers must pay 1,288 SDRs ($1,709.90) for each passenger in case of baggage destruction, loss, damage, or delay.Likewise, 5,346 SDRs ($7,097.16) should be compensated for each passenger in relation to damage caused by delay in the carriage of persons. \nIn a bid to ensure basic health care services to metropolis residents, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City has started setting up laboratories and physiotherapy equipment in all of its 32 urban health promotion centres.Health officials at the city office believe this move will help improve the existing basic health care service and address the rising demand for physiotherapy services.“Due to the lack of laboratory services in most of our urban health clinics, patients have been forced to seek services at state-run hospitals and private centres, which are often overcrowded and expensive,” said Deepak Kumar KC, chief of the health department of the metropolis. “At our health facilities, we will provide all services free of cost to needy patients.”The city office runs 32 urban health promotion centres, one in each ward of the metropolis. KC said the metropolis opened vacancies to hire 108 staffers, including 32 physiotherapists, 29 lab technicians, four medical officers, five staff nurses, 10 radiographers, 10 pharmacy assistants, and 26 peons for the urban health clinics.The city office provides 98 types of essential medicines—for communicable and non-communicable diseases, including high blood pressure, diabetes, mental health, heart disease, asthma, cholesterol, and respiratory problems—free of cost.Patients with government health insurance can get over 300 types of medicines from urban health clinics, according to health officials.KC said that physiotherapy and laboratory services would be available within six weeks. The metropolis has already been running laboratories in six urban health clinics.Providing free physiotherapy and laboratory testing is among the health services the city office plans to offer to the residents of the metropolis.Earlier, KMC provided mental health screening training to doctors and paramedics serving at urban health promotion centres. Officials hoped that the move would help hundreds of mental health patients in the city get timely treatment. Officials say that they are also planning to provide free medication to patients with mental health problems.Although neither the federal government agency nor the city office has data on the number of people suffering from mental health problems in the metropolis, doctors estimated that many residents could be suffering from various forms of mental health problems including anxiety and depression, among others. Health workers say that many city residents, despite having mental health problems, do not seek treatment and instead turn to drugs and substances to cope. Due to entrenched social stigma, fear of discrimination, and other factors, many patients in Nepal do not openly discuss their mental health issues.The metropolis has upgraded its urban health clinics to urban health promotion centres and started providing services through medical doctors. The idea behind starting health promotion centres is to provide comprehensive healthcare services to the city dwellers, especially those who cannot afford to go to expensive health facilities and buy costly medicines, according to officials. \nA 60-year-old man from ward 7 of Bidur Municipality in Nuwakot district, succumbed to dengue on Wednesday night.The man was first rushed to Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital (TUTH) on Monday night as his condition deteriorated, and later to a private hospital for intensive care due to a lack of vacant intensive care unit beds at the TUTH.Doctors attending the victim suffered from severe dengue, which led to shock, internal bleeding and multiorgan failure.Officials at the Ministry of Health and Population, however, claimed that dengue was not the direct cause of death, as the victim also had high blood pressure. They claimed that while infection rates have increased of late, the number of severe cases and deaths has not increased proportionately. But experts say the situation is far worse than what the authorities admit.The rise in infection rate has not only overwhelmed general hospitals of the Kathmandu Valley, but also caused an acute blood crisis, increased premature birth, low birth weight, and a shortage of paracetamol in pharmacies. “Many patients suffering from dengue shock syndrome, hemorrhagic fever, pneumonia, diarrhoea, and multi-organ failure due to severe dengue have been admitted to our hospital,” said Dr Niraj Bam, an associate professor at the Institute of Medicine, TUTH. “Agencies responsible must take measures immediately to break the chain of the infection and prevent an exponential rise in new cases.”Public health experts blame the apathy of health agencies and government for the exponential rise in cases. They say neither the concerned health agencies nor the government are taking the situation seriously.“Previously, we used to carry out search and destroy drives frequently to destroy mosquito breeding sites, launch awareness drives, and request security agencies for blood donations to manage the dengue epidemic,” said Dr Baburam Marasini, former director at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “But now, no measures are being taken to control the spread of the virus. None of the agencies has considered dengue as a public health emergency.”Experts said more concerning is the fact that the authorities have been attempting to conceal the infection and death rates to avoid criticism, and this is worsening the impact on the general public. “Hundreds of people wait for hours every day for blood at blood banks for their seriously ailing relatives admitted at various hospitals in Kathmandu Valley,” said Sandesh Thapa, a public relations officer at the Central Blood Transfusion Service (blood bank). “But the collection is too low. Even organisations in districts outside the Valley are unable to organise blood donation camps.”Officials at the blood bank said daily demand is around 400 pints, mostly from dengue patients, while donations are only around 30 to 40 pints.“Since the morning, I have received around 40 calls from organisations that previously organised blood donation camps, asking for blood for their former donors,” said Thapa. “But blood can’t be manufactured or bought, and the rise in dengue cases along with the festive season has reduced donations.”Blood bank officials have been asking the relatives of patients to find donors on their own and to post donation requests on social media.Public health experts warn of dire consequences if the seriousness of the dengue outbreak continues to be undermined. They say that the rise in premature births, low birth weights of newborns, and complications in pregnancy will lead to maternal and child mortality rates and jeopardise the achievements made from years of investments and endeavours. “A lot of people have been hospitalised, and hundreds more have been infected. Their experiences are harrowing,” said Dr Ghanshyam Gurung, executive director at the TUTH. “Authorities should not wait for the temperature to drop and the infection rate to decline naturally.”Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika viruses, according to the World Health Organisation.So far, only 11 people have died, and over 22,000 have been infected since the start of 2024 if the government data is to be believed. Experts say reported dengue cases may only represent a small fraction of the true scale of the outbreak, as around 90 percent of the infected people do not show any symptoms and health authorities often concealed the actual number of deaths and infections.As there is no specific treatment for dengue, health workers provide symptomatic care and diagnose patients based on symptoms, including platelet-rich plasma transfusion.According to doctors, mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes are some symptoms of dengue.The World Health Organisation (WHO) says there is no specific treatment for severe dengue, but early detection and access to proper medical care can save lives.Meanwhile, in view of the rising dengue cases, a meeting of the Council of Ministers on Thursday has decided to conduct a 10-minute cleanup campaign in all government offices at 10 am on Friday to remove mosquito breeding sites. The decision was made on the recommendation of the Ministry of Health. Officials said staffers will look for stagnant water in puddles, discarded tyres and bottles, among other things, during the campaign.  \nNepal will receive HPV vaccine doses from GAVI in December for a nationwide vaccination campaign starting in February to immunize 1.68 million girls aged 10-14, significantly reducing cervical cancer risk as HPV is the major cause.\nGovernment-funded medical care for impoverished burn victims in selected state-run hospitals and reembolsoarsment in others, with concerns over lack of specialized care and need for investments in advanced facilities.\nPregnant women in Nepal experience an alarming rise in dengue infections, endangering maternal and newborn health amid a nationwide outbreak that has caused numerous deaths and infections.\nDusit Princess Kathmandu hosts a 5-day trout festival featuring 12 unique dishes, showcasing the versatility and health benefits of locally sourced Nepali trout.\nA young Nepalese girl learns to navigate the challenges of home baking, discovering the scientific principles and techniques that transform simple ingredients into delicious treats.\nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nNamibia captain Merwe Gerhard Erasmus has signed for Kathmandu Gurkhas for the Nepal Premier League (NPL) T20 cricket tournament, the team said on Friday.The first edition of the NPL is set to begin on November 30 in Kathmandu. Erasmus, who was named ICC’s Player of the Year in 2022, has played 52 One Day Internationals and 65 Twenty20 Internationals for Namibia, scoring nearly 2,000 runs and taking 38 wickets in ODIs, and amassing 1,557 runs and 53 wickets in T20Is.Erasmus led Namibia to the Super 12 stage of the 2021 T20 World Cup, securing an 8-wicket victory against Ireland with an unbeaten 53-run knock. In February this year, Erasmus helped Namibia win three out of four games during the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup League 2 Nepal Tri-Series, involving Nepal, Namibia and the Netherlands.\"Merwe Gerhard Erasmus is one of the finest players in Associate cricket, and he's a true leader for his team. His arrival will significantly strengthen Kathmandu Gurkhas in both batting and bowling, and his leadership skills will also be a big boost. We are eagerly looking forward to his arrival,\" said Sandesh Katwal, chief executive officer of Kathmandu Gurkhas.Erasmus, who also plays in the International League T20 (ILT20) in Dubai, said he is very excited to join Kathmandu Gurkhas for the NPL. \"I am extremely proud to become a member of the Gurkhas family. Representing an iconic team in a country known for its courage and strength, Nepal, is a greathonour for me,\" said Erasmus. \"We are ready to bring that fearless spirit to the cricket field and make it memorable.\"Erasmus is the second foreign player to join Kathmandu Gurkhas after the team also signed Netherlands opener Michael Levitt, who holds the record for the fastest T20 International century for his country. In March, Levitt scored a blistering 135 off 62 balls against Namibia in Kathmandu, reaching his century in just 49 balls. During that tour, Levitt also made two half centuries in three T20Is against Nepal.Kathmandu Gurkhas, owned by Kathmandu Sports Development Venture, has Karan KC as their marquee player. The Gurkhas have also bought Shahab Alam, Bhim Sharki, Rashid Khan, Shankar Rana, Krishna Karki, Dipesh Kandel, Sumit Maharjan, Raju Rijal, Vivek KC and Pratik Shrestha through auction. \nNepal will face off against India in the semi-finals of the SAFF Women’s Championship in a repeat of last edition’s clash after they demolished Sri Lanka 6-0 in a completely one-sided affair at the Dasharath Stadium in Kathmandu on Thursday to progress as group winners.Rekha Paudel scored a brace, while Sabitra Bhandari, Sabita Rana Magar, Amisha Karki and Rashmi Kumari Ghising were also on target for Nepal.Nepali women have now reached the semi-finals of the SAFF champions in all seven editions of the tournament since its inception in 2010.The outcome gave coach Rajendra Tamang’s team seven points from three matches and helped them top Group A on goal difference.Earlier, Bhutan mauled the Maldives 13-0—this edition’s biggest victory so far—to progress into the last four.Deki Lhazom scored five goals, while Pema Choden and Tshering Yanden were at the double for Bhutan. Sonam Choden, Namgyel Dema, Deki Yangdon and Tshering Lhaden also netted for Bhutan.The result left Nepal needing a victory of at least a six-goal margin to top Bhutan, who had scored a total of 17 goals and conceded one, on goal difference and avoid a clash against defending champions Bangladesh, who on Wednesday outclassed five-time champions India 3-1 to show their intent to win a second straight title after breaking India’s iron grip of the throne last edition.Nepal have yet to win the SAFF Womens’ title despite reaching the final in five of the previous six editions. Nepal are also looking to win their first ever silverware in the international competition.Coach Tamang said before the game that Nepal would aim for a victory against Sri Lanka rather than winning big and aiming to topple Bhutan on the top of the group table.However, as the game progressed, it was a test of determination for Nepal to score the sixth, which they passed in the fourth minute of stoppage time through Ghising, who was scoreless in previous two matches.Nepal were also boosted by the return of Sabitra Bhandari, who plays for French women’s first division club Ev Avant Guingamp, to the starting Xi after missing the star striker in the first two games.Bhandari’s presence was immediately felt as she showed her pace and accuracy to cut inside from the right and set up Rana Magar, who confidently placed the ball into the back of the net to give Nepal the lead in the 8th minute.Bhandari then doubled Nepal’s advantage in the 12th, wonderfully curling a strike from outside the box for a world-class finish.Rekha Paudel, who shone in the absence of Bhandari in the clash against the Maldives finding the net five times, scored Nepal’s third a minute later with a marvelous volley.Paudel then scored her individual seventh goal and team’s fourth in the 36th, back-flicking a shot from Bhandari. Her flick added a touch of magic to Bhandari’s effort as the ball changed its course and tricked Sri Lanka goalkeeper Weerasingha before entering the net.When Nepal went into the half-time with a comfortable 4-0 lead—like they did against the Maldives in their 11-0 victory—hopes were lit that they could complete another goal fest against Sri Lanka as well.But the Sri Lankan defenders did not give up easily and remained dead set on preventing Nepal from scoring their sixth goal.Karki took Nepal closer to the target of a six-goal margin victory, adding Nepal’s fifth two minutes into the restart, heading a cross from Rana Magar.Soon, the game turned into a contest and struggle for finding the net at least once more and a frantic defending to prevent that from happening, with the Sri Lankan bench rejoicing in each save and defence.Rekha should have completed the job at the stroke of hour mark when Saru Limbu set her up with a golden chance to score from close range but she missed it.Bhandari came close to scoring twice but was denied both times, first by Navan Jana Perera with a goal-line clearance and then the goalkeeper.Rekha thought she finally broke the Sri Lanka resistance in the 83rd but her goal was disallowed for an offside.Tensions surrounded the packed stadium as the game entered into the seven minutes of stoppage time.Ghising finally got the sixth goal all were looking for heading in a corner from second-half substitute Anita Basnet, sending the crowd into frenzy. “I am very happy for the support we got from the supporters because it added a lot of energy into our team,” said player of the match Rana Magar. “Our team played well today. Thanks to my teammates for an amazing performance.”Nepal will now aim to defeat India in the last four again and for a second time in the competition's history. They had defeated India 1-0 in the semi-finals two years ago for their first ever win over the side in the regional competition. \nNepal were thrashed 9-2 by Japan in their opening match of the AFC U-17 Asian Cup Qualifiers in Qatar on Wednesday.Nepal initially took the lead with Sabin Kumar Magar scoring in the 12th minute, but Japan quickly retaliated with a barrage of goals. Daichi Tani was the standout performer, netting four times in the 17th, 38th, 41st, and 61st minutes. Hiroto Asada added three goals in the 19th minute, injury time of the first half, and the 64th minute. Mibuki Kasai and Kaiji Chonan completed Japan’s scoring with goals in the 73rd and 77th minutes, respectively. Bigyan Khadka managed a late consolation for Nepal in the 88th minute. In an earlier match, Qatar defeated Mongolia 2-0. Nepal will next face Qatar on Friday, while Mongolia are set to play Japan. \nDefending champions Bangladesh showed their intent to win the SAFF Women’s Championship trophy for a second straight time as they defeated India 3-1 in their last Group A match at the Dasharath Stadium in Kathmandu on Wednesday.Tohura Khatun scored a brace after Afeida Khandaker opened the scoring for Bangladesh. Bala Devi Ngangom pulled one back for India.It was Bangladesh’s second consecutive victory over India in the group stage of the SAFF women’s competition, having also beaten them 3-0 in 2022.Two years ago, the Bengal Tigresses broke five-time champions India’s sole domination on the throne since the inception of the competition 14 years ago by winning the title for the first time and the outcome serves as a clear statement Bangladesh are in Kathmandu again to repeat the feat.The victory also helped Bangladesh progress into the semi-finals as group winners with four points. They will face the runners-up of Group B in the last four.Nepal currently occupy the top spot in Group B due to goal difference despite being square with Bhutan on four points. Nepal face Sri Lanka and Bhutan meet the Maldives in the final group games on Thursday.India advanced as the second-placed team in the group with three points and will lock horns against the Group B winners for a place in the final after missing out on the title match for the first time in 2022.There were questions whether Bangladesh would be able to keep their title defence on track under their new coach Peter James Butler when they had to rely on a stoppage time goal from Shamsunnahar Junior to rescue a draw against less fancied Pakistan.But the Tigresses were a different side against India and kept their opponents under pressure from early on, with Shamsunnahar Junior reaching closer to goal in the 5th minute.Bangladesh had to survive a scare in the 11th when a blunder from their goalkeeper Rupna Chakma almost allowed Manisha Kalyan to score.But Bangladesh quickly regrouped and took the lead in the 19th minute when Khandaker surprised unfortunate India goalkeeper Panthoi Chanu and defenders with a chip shot after the goalie’s poor attempt to grab a corner fell into her path.Bangladesh continued to knock at India’s door with attacks after attacks, with Ritu Porna Chakma rattling the crossbar in the 26th.The pressure paid off again as Tohura doubled Bangladesh’s lead three minutes later. Indian goalie Chanu was at fault again as her another poor goalkeeping effort to keep away a cross from Ritu allowed Tohura to tap in from close range.Bala Devi Ngangom should have reduced the deficit in the 35th when Ranjana Chanu Sorokhaibam set her up for an open chance with a perfect cross just outside the six yard box but the striker shot straight at the goalkeeper.India’s Kalyan went close to scoring minutes later but her freekick hit the crossbar.Bangladesh then punished India for missed opportunities furthering their lead in the 42nd. Shamsunnahar Senior and Shamsunnahar Junior combined to set up Tohura whose missile from the edge of the area gave India netkeeper Chanu no chance.India were finally able to find some breathing space a minutes later when Bangladesh goalkeeper Rupna’s feeble effort to stop a cross from Dalima Chhibber let Bala Devi to head comfortably over her.But Rupna became the hero of Bangladesh after the break as she made two brilliant saves to keep out superb efforts from Sanju—in the 56th—and second half substitute Jyoti Chauhan—in the 62nd.India continued their search for goals with no fruit and it was Bangladesh who nearly got their fourth in the 80th with Sapna Rani forcing India’s Chanu into a finger tip save with a long-ranged shot. \nRekha Paudel scored five goals and Preeti Rai netted a hat-trick as Nepal demolished the Maldives 11-0 in a total domination in their second Group B match of the SAFF Women’s Championship at the Dasharath Stadium in Kathmandu on Monday.Sabita Rana Magar, Anita KC and Amisha Karki were also on target for Nepal.The victory margin is Nepal’s third biggest win in the SAFF Women’s competition, and fourth overall. They had beaten Afghanistan 13-0 and Pakistan 12-0 during the group stage of the inaugural SAFF Women’s Championship in 2010 in Bangladesh. India hold the record for the biggest win of the competition, having defeated Bhutan with a scoreline of 18-0, also in the 2010 edition.The win against the Maldives is also a clear message that coach Rajendra Tamang’s team, who were held to a 0-0 draw by Bhutan in their opening match, are still favoured to win their maiden trophy after reaching final in five of the six previous editions.Coach Tamang made five changes in the squad that played a goalless stalemate against Bhutan, resting captain and goalkeeper Anjila Tumbapo Subba and star forward Sabitra Bhandari, who arrived in Kathmandu from France on Monday morning. Second choice goalkeeper Anjana Rana Magar, Rekha Paudel, Bimala BK, Bimala Chaudhary and Nisha Thokar started against the Maldives.Hira Bhujel and Dipa Shahi, who were stretchered off during the Bhutan clash due to injuries, are set to miss the rest of the SAFF championship.Nepal women were under a huge pressure after going winless against Bhutan for the first time in their SAFF history.The presence of Bhandari was also badly missed and there were doubts whether Nepal could deliver against the Maldives.But Paudel did not let the absence of Bhandari gloom the crowd again.Nepal were totally dominant from the start, pushing the Maldives to a frantic defending from early on.The pressure immediately paid off as Rai started the goal rush when her low shot from the left astonishingly beat two defenders before squeezing past Maldives goalkeeper Aminath Leeza in the 5th minute.The early setback woke up Leeza and the goalkeeper put all her effort to deny Paudel twice and Rashmi Ghising once to keep Nepal from scoring further.But Sabita Rana Magar undid Leeza in the 29th minute with a well-measured left-footed long ranger, which suddenly opened the floodgates. Paudel smelled blood and scored twice before the break—first flicking a cross from Ghising in the 32nd minute and then tapping in a pass from Sabita in the 42nd minute. The goal fest continued after the break as well. Paudel then completed her hat-trick three minutes into the restart smashing the roof of the net from close range after Aminath Zaahiya failed to clear her first attempt from a tight angle.Paudel got her fourth in the 63rd minute after Saru Limbu, who also engineered Nepal’s fifth goal earlier, put her through with a clever pass.Rai scored a screamer in the 65th for her individual second, arrowing from the edge of the box after Paudel cut back for her.Anita KC got Nepal’s eighth in the 69th seconds after coming off the bench after running into substitute Anita Basnet’s pass that collected a bit of luck off a deflection from Hawwa Haneefa. Paudel got her fifth goal of the game in the 78th after KC set her up.Rai scored her hat-trick in the 87th through a penalty after MSB Ahmed Ali handled the ball inside the area, and substitute Karki wrapped up a big victory a minute later converting a pass from Sabita.Nepal had a total of 35 shots at attempt—22 of them were on target—to the Maldives’ none.“Our first match was unexpected. The coach told us to play an attacking game and try to score more. Our objective was clear and I am happy that I was able to score,” player of the match Paudel said during the presentation. “It was a team effort. Thanks to my teammates,” she added.Nepal climbed to the top in the Group B standing on goal difference despite being level on four points with Bhutan, who thumped Sri Lanka 4-1 earlier on the day.Nepal take on Sri Lanka in their final group game on Thursday. Sri Lanka have three points and lie in the third position.The Maldives crashed out after two straight losses and will play for pride against Bhutan on Thursday.Tournament’s most successful side and five-time champions India and defending champions Bangladesh, who beat Nepal in the 2022 final to break India’s iron grip on SAFF throne last edition, are in Group B. India, who beat Pakistan 5-2 in their opening match, have already progressed into the last four. Bangladesh have one point after a damaging draw against Pakistan and face off against India in their last group game on Wednesday. \n A “severe cyclonic storm” pounded India’s eastern coast on Friday, uprooting trees, snapping power lines and inundating some areas, authorities said, adding that no deaths or injuries were reported.Cyclone Dana made landfall in Odisha state around midnight with wind speeds of 100-110 kmph (62-68 mph), gusting up to 120 kph (75 mph), but weakened into a cyclonic storm by forenoon, the weather department said.It is expected to weaken further into a deep depression in the afternoon.Odisha had closed schools, suspended flights to and from its capital city of Bhubaneswar until Friday morning, and evacuated more than half a million people in anticipation of the storm.“We don’t have any reports of damage to life or property, only damage to trees. Power in the affected area will be restored by late afternoon,” said Dilip Routrai, administrative chief of the region where the cyclone made landfall.Ports and industries in the state did not sustain any damage, he said.Paradip port, where work was suspended since Wednesday, had resumed normal operations, a senior port official told Reuters.By late Friday morning, people in several areas began returning to their homes from shelters.“We had tied our goats at home before we left for the shelter and returned to find that both they and our house were safe,” one resident told a local television channel.Heavy rainfall also lashed parts of the neighbouring state of West Bengal and, accompanied by a surge in the sea water, left low lying areas inundated, damaging the standing paddy crop that was almost ready for harvest in some fields.“Winter vegetables also perished in large agricultural tracts because of heavy rains and storm surge of the sea water that entered many areas in the Sunderbans belt,” said Bankim Hazra, minister for Sunderban Affairs.Flight operations resumed on Friday morning at the airports in Bhubaneswar and the West Bengal capital Kolkata, where too they were suspended since Thursday evening.Some of the 200 train services that were suspended also resumed operations.Severe storms pummel the coasts of India and neighbouring Bangladesh during the cyclone season from April to December each year, damaging both life and property.Odisha saw its worst cyclone in recent years in 1999, which raged for 30 hours and killed 10,000 people. \nIndonesia has emerged as a prime destination for artificial intelligence investment in Southeast Asia, driven by low electricity costs and supportive regulations, tech industry insiders say.The country is seen to harbor potential for hosting data centers and fostering AI applications, even though foundational AI infrastructure is expected to remain concentrated in more established tech hubs such as the United States and China.“I believe that, in terms of creating an infrastructure of AI, Southeast Asia is definitely not playing the game. The reason Malaysia and Indonesia are such hotspots for investment is because, among Asia, they have some of the lowest electricity costs,” said Esther Wong, founder and CEO of venture capital firm 3Cap, in a panel discussion at the Tech in Asia conference held in Jakarta on Wednesday.In addition to affordable energy, Wong highlighted that Indonesia was also appealing for its “very welcoming stance” on foreign direct investment.With its vast coastline, the country also had the ability to provide sustainable energy from sources such as tidal power, Wong pointed out, which could help reduce the energy burden of AI data centers.Tech giants have committed more than US$55 billion in investments to the region since 2023, according to Tech in Asia data as of July plus a more recent investment by Oracle in Malaysia.However, only $1.9 billion of that went to AI-related businesses in Indonesia, namely $1.7 billion from Microsoft and $200 million from Nvidia.The ability to provide low-cost energy for IT infrastructure such as data centers is critical for the development of AI and for running AI-based applications.Data centres consume significant amounts of energy for data processing and storage as well as for cooling systems, with AI applications being particularly demanding in terms of computing resources and therefore energy.However, the data centre industry previously said Indonesia’s electricity prices, ranging from 11 to 12 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh), were not competitive compared to Malaysia’s lower rate of 8 cents per kWh.Despite the region’s potential to attract investment in AI infrastructure, experts believe Southeast Asia will likely focus on developing practical AI software solutions rather than foundational AI models like those built in the US and China.Wesley Tay, principal at investment firm East Ventures, expressed confidence in the region’s ability to drive advancements in AI, particularly at the application level.Start-ups in the region are increasingly adopting open-source models and large language models (LLMs) to build solutions tailored to local needs, particularly in the software-as-a-service (SaaS) sector.“This application will then depend on the ability to gather the necessary data to train contextual data on top of open-source or closed-source models,” said Tay, underlining the role of data in differentiating AI solutions in Southeast Asia.Zia Zaman, general manager at Microsoft Ventures, the tech giant’s venture capital arm, echoed this view, suggesting the region’s AI development was likely to be more pragmatic and focused on profitability rather than research.He stressed the importance of looking beyond consumer-facing applications to how AI could empower businesses to operate more efficiently.“It will be practical; it will rise to profitability quicker, and it will likely ease [business-to-business operations],” Zaman said. “Don’t just think [business-to-consumer], guys. There’s so much more value in thinking about that community at home.”-In association with the Asia News Network \nThe United States does not want a protracted Israeli campaign in Lebanon, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Thursday, as efforts got underway to hold fresh talks over a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza.A month into Israel’s military onslaught against the Iranian-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah, Blinken said he hoped Iran was getting a clear message that any further attacks on Israel risked its own interests. Israel has vowed retaliation for an Iranian missile barrage on October 1.Israel’s military chief said an end to the conflict with Hezbollah looked possible but gave few details. Several Israeli strikes hit Beirut’s southern suburbs on Thursday evening, Reuters witnesses said.US and Israeli negotiators will gather in Doha to prepare for renewed talks on a Gaza ceasefire deal which would also entail release of hostages in the Palestinian enclave, Qatar and Washington said.Israel said its Mossad intelligence agency head David Barnea will travel to Doha on Sunday to try to restart talks, and meet with CIA director William Burns and Qatar’s prime minister.“The parties will discuss the various options for starting negotiations for the release of the hostages from Hamas captivity, against the backdrop of the latest developments,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said.An Egyptian security delegation met with a delegation of Hamas leaders in Cairo, part of efforts to resume the Gaza ceasefire negotiations, Egypt’s state-affiliated Al Qahera News TV said.Hamas senior official Osama Hamdan told Lebanese pro-Iranian TV channel Al Mayadeen there was no change in the group’s position. “The hostages held by the resistance will only return by stopping the aggression and completely withdrawing,” Hamdan said.Previous attempts to reach a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal have failed.Blinken, who held talks with Qatar’s prime minister, has been on his first trip to the region since Israel killed Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, a mastermind of the group’s October 7, 2023 attack on Israel that triggered conflict across the Middle East. Washington, Israel’s close ally, has expressed hope his death can provide an impetus for an end to the fighting.Israel unleashed its Lebanon offensive with the declared aim of securing the return of tens of thousands of people evacuated from homes in northern Israel during a year of cross-border hostilities with Hezbollah.Israel has used airstrikes to pound southern Lebanon, Beirut’s southern suburbs and the Bekaa Valley, and sent ground forces into areas near the border. Lebanese authorities say the campaign has killed more than 2,500 people and displaced more than 1 million people, spawning a humanitarian crisis.“As Israel conducts operations to remove the threat to Israel and its people along the border with Lebanon, we have been very clear that this cannot lead, should not lead, to a protracted campaign,” Blinken said in Doha.Blinken said the US was working on a diplomatic deal which would allow civilians on both sides on the border to return to their homes.Later, the head of Israel’s military said an end to the conflict with Hezbollah now looked possible.“In the north (of Israel), there’s a possibility of reaching a sharp conclusion. We thoroughly dismantled Hezbollah’s senior chain of command,” Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi said in a video statement.Blinken said Israel should take steps to avoid civilian casualties and not endanger UN peacekeepers or Lebanese army troops.Earlier on Thursday, an Israeli strike killed three Lebanese soldiers as they tried to evacuate wounded people from the border village of Yater, the Lebanese army said. There was no comment from the Israeli military.The Lebanese army’s deployment into the south, where Hezbollah holds sway, is seen as vital to any diplomatic resolution to the war.‘STORM’ OF DESTRUCTIONIn Paris, a conference convened by France raised $200 million for the Lebanese military and $800 million in humanitarian aid.“There needs to be a ceasefire in Lebanon. More damage, more victims, more strikes will not enable the end of terrorism or ensure security for everyone,” French President Emmanuel Macron said. He said the conference would support the recruitment of 6,000 Lebanese troops and provide the army with supplies.Lebanon’s caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati said a ceasefire was in Israel’s hands. “The storm we are currently witnessing...carries the seeds of total destruction, not only for our country, but for all human values,” he said.Israeli attacks on Thursday included a strike on a vehicle on a highway from Beirut to the Bekaa Valley - one of Lebanon’s busiest roads. A security source said one person was killed.The Israeli military said around 120 projectiles fired by Hezbollah had crossed into Israel.In northern Israel, air raid sirens sounded in Nahariya. Explosions could be heard as air defences fired to intercept rockets.At least 25 Israeli soldiers have been killed in southern Lebanon since the ground operation began three weeks ago. The Israeli military said on Thursday five more soldiers were killed and seven wounded there during combat.Hezbollah opened fire on Oct. 8, 2023, in solidarity with its Palestinian allies in Gaza. Israel’s Gaza offensive has killed nearly 43,000 people, according to Gaza authorities, and laid waste to the territory. The Hamas-led attack which sparked it killed 1,200 people and resulted in another 250 being abducted, according to Israeli tallies.At least 16 Palestinians were killed, including children, and 32 wounded in an Israeli strike on a school in Gaza’s Nuseirat camp, its Al-Awda hospital said.The Israeli military said it hit a Hamas command and control centre housed in a compound formerly used as a school in the Nuseirat area.Israel's military said on Thursday it had killed a Hamas commander, Mohammad Abu Itiwi, who took part in the October 7, 2023 assault on southern Israel and who also worked for UN aid agency UNRWA in the Gaza Strip. Israel has accused the agency of having many employees who double as members of Hamas and other armed groups. UNRWA had no immediate comment regarding the latest Israeli allegation. \nTropical Storm Trami has killed at least 26 people and forced more than 150,000 to flee their homes in the Philippines, officials said on Thursday, as it made landfall on the northeastern coast.Trami, locally known as severe tropical storm Kristine, dumped heavy to torrential rain on the main island of Luzon triggering widespread flooding and landslides.With maximum sustained winds of 95 kph, the storm was moving westward across the mountainous northern region of Cordillera towards the South China Sea, the state weather agency said in its 11 a.m. ( weather bulletin.It warned of heavy to intense rainfall, flooding, landslides and storm surges for some northern provinces.Most of the deaths from the storm over the past few days were due to drowning and landslides in the central Bicol region, including Naga City where 14 were reported dead on Thursday, officials said.Trami made landfall in the northeastern town of Divilacan in Isabela province. The town's disaster chief, Ezikiel Chavez, said no fatalities had been reported.The government ordered businesses and schools in the path of the storm to close in anticipation of heavy rain and floods.Over 163,000 people were sheltering in evacuation centres, the civil defence office said, most of whom were in Bicol as residents fled their homes after floodwaters reached as high as the roofs of bungalow houses.The civil aviation regulator said on Thursday at least a dozen flights across the country had been cancelled due to the storm.The central bank cancelled foreign exchange trading and monetary operations for a second straight day.The Philippines typically records an average of 20 tropical storms annually, often resulting in heavy rains, strong winds, and deadly landslides. \nChaaaiiittt…The spontaneous eruption of the sound of victory thundered through the neighbourhood of Nhyokha in the Kathmandu core. The line of a kite cut another. Looking out the window of her house, Sajani Shrestha saw children running full speed, shouting and fighting as they vied to catch the falling kite and thread. And craning her neck up to the sky, she could not count but only be mesmerised by the innumerable kites strewn across the skies of Nhyokha, Bangemudha, Indrachowk. “There would be so many kites that they entirely covered the blue of the sky, making beautiful patterns of different colours,” says the 51-year-old. “And you cannot imagine the number of times the call of chait rang in the air.”Clear blue sky and gentle westerlies, the season of kites has arrived in the Kathmandu Valley. While kites soared Kathmandu's sky mainly during Dashain, the kite season officially started in Nag Panchami (August) and ended on the Haribodhini Ekadashi (November). And from royalities to commoners, young and old all flew kites from rooftops and open grounds. Even those who did not, like Sajani, revelled in the live spectacle in the sky as kites soared and fought. With Bhimsen Thapa’s help, King Girvanyuddha flies kites The earliest written account of kite flying is believed to date to 200 BC in China. In Kathmandu, this tradition has religious and socio-cultural and environmental significance, says Tina Manandhar, lecturer of Nepalese History, Culture and Archaeology at Tribhuvan University. According to her, it is believed that kites in Kathmandu skies carry a message to the god of rain Indra that the valley's farmers have had enough rain for their crops. That is why Kathmandu farmers scolded anyone flying kites before plantation season.In an article ‘Changako Utpati Ra Bikas’ published in Gorkhapatra in 1995, historian Rajesh Gautam points to the lack of written documents indicating the exact time when kite culture was introduced in Nepal. Exploring different opinions on kite's introduction to Nepal, he writes that “some have opined the possibility that the skill and tradition of kite flying might have entered Nepal through India.” Yet some others, he writes, state that kites “came to Nepal from Japan during the time of [Rana PM] Dev Shumsher.”He concludes that most likely this tradition was introduced by Malla-era Newar traders: “But since Nepal’s relationship with Tibet and China is very old and direct, kites might have entered Nepal through the Newar traders who were engaged in the trade. One can estimate that the kite was introduced to Nepal during the (mediaeval) Malla regime.”In Social History of Nepal, TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi write that there exists documented evidence of the kite flying from the early 19th century. The authors state that Sundarananda, a contemporary poet, has mentioned that the young king Girvanyuddha Bikram Shah (r.1799-1816), with the help of Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa, flew kites from the towering temple of Taleju Bhawani, Hanumandhoka. And when the king's kite cut the kites of the youngsters, they were located and rewarded with money.In Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Sardar Bhim Bahadur Pandey states that “During the month of Kartik [October-November] young and old all flew kites,” suggesting that kite culture was ubiquitous in Kathmandu by the early twentieth century.Anticipations and preparationsKite flying in Nepal requires a kite, a lattai (a wooden spool), thread and majha (homemade adhesive prepared by boiling snail slime, rice or sago, and powdered glass from burnt electric bulbs and coated on the line to sharpen it for kite fighting).77-year-old Nirmal Man Tuladhar, an avid kite flyer and retired professor of Linguistics at the Tribhuvan University, explains how Nepali tradition of kite flying was both expensive and needing advance preparation.“In our times, it wasn’t easy to fly kites,” he says. “We had to prepare majha …And as Nepali kites are fighter kites, we mainly fought with other kites [which meant we spent a lot of threads].”This preparation needed first and foremost of passing a hurdle: securing finances and materials to fly kites. While lattai was a one-time investment that could be saved for years, kites and threads had to be replenished every time a kite was cut.“Those were the times when parents wanted us to be more focused in our studies. They only gave money [to buy kites] after immense pestering,” says 80-year-old Dwarika Nath Dhungel, former Secretary of Nepal government, speaking of the 1950s and 1960s.Biodiversity specialist and botanist Tirtha Bahadur Shrestha, 86, was born in Mahabouddha and began flying kites from 1951-52. He saved what little money he got for afternoon snacks to buy Hattimar reel, a brand of line wound in a small lattai, which was strong and sharp and where majha stuck well.Raghuji Pant, a member of parliament, also recalls the difficulty in securing money to sustain his kite flying in and around Kathmandu core in the 1960s and early 1970s. “Four to five of my kites were cut in a day,” writes the 67-year-old in his 2019 article “Changa Jastai Udi Hidne Man” published in Himalkhabar. “[This caused] the line in the spool to shorten. From Bhadra [August-September] to one to one and a half months after Dashain I spent flying kites. So, it was difficult for me to have enough kites even after getting money from grandfather, grandmother, mother and everyone.”Kites and thread secured, now began the crucial work of preparing and applying majha whose strength determined how well it cut other kites. Govinda Tandon, 70, a historian and heritage expert, who grew up in Battisputali, was also an ardent kite flyer.“Materials for making majha were prepared right from the morning on a holiday,\" he writes in his article “Dashainko Butte Changa” published in Gorkhapatra. “Because this work couldn’t be accomplished without a collaboration of 3-4 friends, a holiday was set aside for this. Moreover, a sunny day was considered appropriate. If the majha didn’t dry, the thread could turn moist, and so if it felt like the day wouldn’t be sunny, the entire plan…was aborted.”Kite makers, kite sellers and variety of kites One of the oldest shops in Kathmandu's memory, Shree Chitrakar Kite Center in Tyauda, Asan is bustling with customers during Dashain. “When my grandmother got married and came to this house at age 12 [in early 1940s], this shop was already here,” says its fourth generation owner 47-year-old Dinoj Chitrakar. “So the shop must be around a hundred years old.”Another shop that stands out in Kathmandu's memory is Manandhar Kite Center in Kalimati, established in 1949, and currently run by brothers Mohan Man and Sundar Man Manandhar.In his book Antar Taranga, artist and writer Manuj Babu Mishra recalls “a kite shop near the old halwai shop of Chabahil” in the 1940s. Dhungel and his 1960 batchmates of Juddhodaya Public School recall the kite shops from the 1950s and 1960s – Bekhacha’s Shop at Netapacho, Bhaicha’s Shop at Nhyokha, Lata Manandhar’s Shop at Maru, Kanchha Buddha Bajracharya Shop at Tyauda.Besides the shops, there were makers and sellers of kites cloistered in different localities of Kathmandu Valley.In Kwalkhu, Patan was a Joshi who made Nepali paper kites.“One day I accompanied my uncle to buy kites,\" writes Dibya Giri, 69, in his 2023 article “Changa” in Sahitya Post. “I was amazed to see the huge stacks of kites there. We used to call it the house of the kite maker.”In Nhyokha, Purna Bahadur Shrestha began making kites as a teenager and started his own kite business in the 1950s, according to his daughter Sajani.These kites, made out of Nepali paper, often had different paintings. Mishra recalls painting kites for the kite shop in Chabahil.“I went to that kite shop and with the freely available colours and Nepali papers, I spent my day painting faces, birds, animals, masks, mountains, hills, whatever came to my mind,” he writes in the book. “Such kites apparently sold well!”Most septuagenarians and older generations like Tuladhar and Tirtha Bahadur recall flying kites made of Nepali paper when young. Tirtha Bahadur says that kites from Lucknow began coming to Kathmandu only after the late 1950s. But at least a section of Kathmandu was flying kites from Lucknow from the early twentieth century. Vaidya, Manandhar and Joshi write that the Ranas and Shahs imported kites from Lucknow and that from them, their favourite employees also got to fly some. These kites were large and, in Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Pande writes that they were referred to as Lucknowia kites.Known for their characteristic hissing sound they made while flying, light body, swift movement and ability to take sharp turns, Lucknow kites were preferred by kite fighters.“Lucknow kites were lighter and could be manoeuvred well,” says Tuladhar. “Kites of Nepali paper were stable but difficult to manoeuvre. They were also expensive. So only some fighters flew Nepali paper kites.”The kites had different names depending upon their designs and colours – Ambe (a heart in the centre), Dibdibe (chequered), Pakhete (a different coloured paper on one edge), Sete (white-coloured), Nilchi (blue-coloured), Rate (red-coloured) and so on.The kite fighters preferred the strong and sharp Hattimar reel that came on a small lattai. The Belchamar reel was cheaper but weaker and prone to be cut by other threads. Kite fliers and kite watchers on rooftops and open groundsBibek Shrestha, 57, and his two brothers took stacks of kites and climbed their rooftops. The rooftops around theirs in the neighbourhood of Nhyokha – in fact in all core settlements of the Valley – were filled with kite fliers and spectators. Many risked precariously balancing on the sloped roofs.While Bibek and his brothers’ kites alighted to meet the sea of kites in the sky, their sister Sajani and other family members gathered around to revel in the live spectacle.Dhungel remembers the rooftops of Jhochhen and surroundings of the 1950s and 1960s swelled with kite fliers. Dhungel did try to fly kites. But he did not become a successful kite flyer. What he did become was, like Sajani and many Kathmandu residents, an admirer of kites soaring in the sky.“But more than engaging in my unsuccessful kite flying attempts, I enjoyed looking at the kites flying. There would be a big crowd of spectators. Females and other family members watched the kites fly as they ate meat and chiura. Some even drank and rejoiced as they flew kites.”When the age of cassette player and speakers dawned in the 1980s, songs blared from the speakers alongside kite flying. Chitrakar and Bibek invited their friends, put their favourite songs on speakers and spent entire afternoons flying kites, dancing, singing and eating.Away from the core cities, in the villages in the Valley, people flew kites in open fields. Like Dibya, who set his kite for flight from the banks of Godavari River in Tikathali. Chhauni was also a popular space for flying kites.Kathmandu’s joy in kite fightingBibek pulled his kite down and then manoeuvred it back up so his line touched his opponent's line from below and quickly reeled out his line. The resulting sharpness from the speed cut the opponent's line.Chaaaiiitttt………“The greatest fun comes from cutting another kite's string,” writes Tuladhar in his 1996 article “Cutting is the greatest fun” published in magazine Kite Lines. “With its coating of adhesive paste and ground glass, the string is as sharp and abrasive as sandpaper on your opponent's line.”Nepali kite, Tuladhar says, is made to fight other kites, and describes how a kite line cuts the other.“The technique is to touch your rival's string and immediately reel out line at high speed,” he writes. “The Nepalese style of kite flying is aggressive, and though the kites look simple, they are strategically designed for bringing down other kites.”At any given time, like Bibek’s kite above Nhyokha sky, skies above the Valley were filled with raging kites, swinging, coming down and going up as the fighters reeled in and out their lattais in ferocious attempts to bring down other kites.Meanwhile spectators cheered. “Even passersby stopped to look at the kites,” recalls Tina.The moment of a kite cutting was accompanied by the sound of chait, and children ran in the direction of the falling kite to grab it and the thread in what was termed as, Dibya says, changa lutne/dhago lutne.Dhungel always joined in to shout the chait resounding through the locality of Jhochhen and almost automatically his feet sped towards the severed kites' direction.“‘Oii leave that thread,’ the kite owner would scold me. ‘Why do you pull my thread, leave it right now.’ But I’d continue pulling the threads as the owner continued shouting. Other times I caught the kites that had failed to fly and dropped on the ground.”The fallen kites got stuck in the buildings, trees or poles, or glided down in the open grounds or paddy fields. Falling kites from the Kathmandu core settled down in Tundikhel covering it. Oftentimes kites fell on the fields to rest upon the lush paddy nearing its harvest.“Children ran straight into the fields to catch the kite,” says Dibya. \"They destroyed the crops by stepping on them. Some farmers chased them, scolding along as they did so and if they caught anyone, they slapped them.”Love and restrictions on kiteAmidst the raging kite fights high up in the sky, there were apparently also some quieter kites lingering much lower among the buildings or tree lines, for their goals lay in not ruthlessly cutting the threads of other kites but piercing softly through the hearts of their owners' love interests. During the Rana regime, there were designated public spaces to fly kites, writes Gautam in his article. Referring to oral accounts, he writes that the Ranas were particularly careful to avoid kite flyers around their durbars. This is because love-stricken men tied letters to kites and flew them into the durbars to their love interests among the nanis.He writes that the kites could be flown mainly on the grounds of Chhauni. Anyone flying kites in any other place and around Rana durbars were arrested.Pant also recalls love-stricken boys from his time. “Just as kites came in different colours and patterns, so did kite flyers,” he writes in the article. “Some wrote love letters using a few words in “symbolic language” on a plain kite and attempted to land it on the rooftop of the girl they liked. Some simply landed their kites on any rooftop if a girl appeared there and waited for reaction.”King Tribhuvan among kite fliersPande writes in his book: “Once or twice during kite season every year, King Tribhuvan went to Chhauni to fly kites. Legend has it that if the line of the king’s kite was cut, it flew to Lhasa. But since anyone who caught that kite received five rupees, everyone attempted to catch that kite.”In 2021 news report ‘Bhawanle Chhekidiyo Changa Udaune Aakash’ by Shivahari Ghimire published in Nayapatrika, cultural expert the late Satyamohan Joshi also recounts that “During Dashain, Tribhuvan came to the ground below Swayambhu to fly kites. […] He did not use the same thread to fly kites twice.”In the same article, Joshi says that the King also went to Budhanilakantha to fly kites and participate in kite flying competitions.End of season, end of cultureMohan Krishna Shrestha, 86, was born in Budhanilakantha. Every year, on the day of Haribodhini Ekadashi, he saw the annual fair at the Budhanilakantha Temple. He also witnessed kite fliers gathered in the open fields around the Temple.“Oh, it’d be a lot of people,” says Shrestha. “They came from all around Bhaktapur, Kathmandu and Lalitpur.”They flew kites on Ekadashi, Dwadashi and some even until Purnima.“They took all the remaining threads and kites that had survived Dashain and flew the last kites of the season,” says Tuladhar. “I remember my uncles, relatives and neighbours going to Budhanilakantha with their kites.”Joshi recalls in the 2021 article that King Tribhuvan also went to Budhanilakantha with his sons Mahendra, Himalaya and Basundhara. He greatly supported and also participated in the competitions there organised by the commoners. If he liked he gave prize money to the winners.This annual event lost its glory days after the decline in the open fields as buildings began to rise with the establishment of Budhanilkantha School in 1972, Mohan says.“The event survived in some form until the 1990s,” he says.But what happened after that?The end-of-the-season event in the 1990s was also an indication of the end of the age-old kite tradition.“If I go to my ancestral place in Asan to fly kites, it’s not possible for me to do that today because there are buildings everywhere,” says Tuladhar. “Cityscapes and urbanisation have created the obstacle for flying kites.”Dibya does feel like flying kites sometimes.“No space to fly kites today,” he says. “In the old times, there were river banks and open fields. Even if you fly kites, it gets stuck in somebody's rooftop or water tank or somewhere.”Yesteryear’s kite enthusiasts believe that increasing means of entertainment was another reason for the decline of kite culture.“When television came, kite flying started to slowly decrease,” says Bibek. “And then mobile phones robbed kite flying even more.”And so, when his sister Sajani cranes her neck up in the sky today, she rarely sees a kite.“Those days we heard one chait after another,” she says. “These days you won’t hear a single chait.” \nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nWhat animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. \nNepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) \nThe 23rd meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Council Heads of Government was held in Islamabad (Pakistan) on October 15-16, 2024. This meeting is important as countries constantly align and realign their interests, trying all opportunities to cooperate while avoiding strategic entanglement in great power rivalry. The SCO, which emerged and entered into force in 2003 in the post-Soviet space, has expanded over time. Originally mooted by China and Russia to counter Western strategic influence in the Central Asia and Eurasian region, it was designed as a geo-strategic organisation to succeed the Shanghai Five formed in 1996. Its focus was on countering the ‘three evils’—terrorism, extremism and separatism. The organisation later expanded, including India and Pakistan as its members in 2017. It is now a regionally anchored multifaceted cooperation with a 10-member organisation responsible for playing a key role as regional multilateralism becomes the norm in international politics. There are three observer countries and 14 dialogue partners, including Nepal and Sri Lanka. India has strongly advocated ‘reformed multilateralism’ and has longstandingly advocated UN Security Council reform. It also emphasises that member states must demonstrate commitment to the SCO Charter rather than cherry-picking issues.Enhancing economic cooperationInitially, the organisation focused on economic cooperation and established transport linkages to bolster trade and economic ties. Except for India, all other member states are part of China’s ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). India continues to emphasise that any transport corridor requires respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty. China’s economic push to the Central Asian Region, at times, has made the Russians uncomfortable. However, given the dynamics of the West, mainly the United States’ approach to both Russia and China, which is believed to be a containment strategy, has brought the two countries closer in the strategic realm. In this context, the SCO is seen as a vehicle for expanding economic relations with an underlying strategic content. India, which has a deeper economic interest, is also concerned about terrorism and extremism that branches out of this geo-political space. It can potentially destabilise India’s efforts to advance the ‘Connect Central Asia policy’ of 2012 and the proposed International North South Transport Corridor (INSCTC) to connect to the larger Eurasian region. India’s access to Central Asia has been through Iran, where it has invested in the Chahbahar Port, a strategic gateway to enhance its economic engagement with the Eurasian region.According to media reports, the SCO countries possess “25 percent of the world's oil reserves, over 50 percent of the world's gas reserves, 35 percent of the world's coal reserves, and roughly 50 percent of the world's known uranium reserves”. India has emphasised collaborative connectivity, which includes industrial cooperation to enhance competitiveness and expand labour markets, micro, small and medium enterprises collaboration and access to affordable pharmaceutical capabilities. Though Pakistan emphasised the ‘SCO connectivity framework’ in the recent summit, it has remained a major stumbling block in allowing India overland connectivity to Central Asia and Afghanistan through Pakistan due to geopolitics and regional rivalry.Evolving strategic spaceThe emergence of the Central Asian Republic for the first time provided the US with a window of opportunity to expand its geo-strategic influence over this region. However, Russia was extremely careful in nurturing its geo-strategic space. It did not want the Central Asian Republics to emerge as a challenge to Russia’s hegemonic presence and influence in the region. The Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) emerged as a forum to have a coordinated effort to deal with security challenges confronting the region. Nonetheless, Russia’s war with Ukraine has limited its ability to come to the rescue of other countries in the region, especially Armenia, in its border conflict with Azerbaijan. This has provided Beijing with an opportunity to step up security cooperation. In May 2023, it convened the first China-Central Asia summit in Xi'an to cooperate on security matters.The United States’ exit from Afghanistan allowed the SCO to emerge as an effective regional player. It has a Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure (RATS), SCO-led military exercises, a SCO Contact Group for Afghanistan and Cooperation on combatting drug trafficking. Afghanistan remains a major security concern for the SCO members, and RATS has been at the forefront of combating such security challenges. Several terrorist and extremist groups operating out of Afghanistan pose a threat to the internal stability of the member countries, given the international terror network that has spawned to carry out attacks. International terrorist groups like Islamic State Khorasan (ISIS-K), Daish and al-Qaeda are entrenching their base in Afghanistan, which is believed to be under the patronage of the Taliban. Yet, the SCO has a cautious approach to Afghanistan. Some countries have preferred to engage the Taliban to deal with terror threats. The recent attacks in Moscow and Pakistan illustrate why engaging Afghanistan is important for some member states. Anti-terrorism Interaction-2024 joint exercise of the SCO member states held in Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region also demonstrates the growing threat of terrorism.Relevance of the SCOAnalysts have often differed on the relevance of the SCO from the member-country’s perspectives. In the post-Cold War period, such regional multilateral organisations mushroomed and were seen as forums to advance collective interest. The SCO needs to be taken into account in the larger geopolitical context. The competitive interests of member countries certainly hinder the potential of any multilateral organisations, as there is a balancing game when granting membership to certain countries. However, it is important to recognise the relevance of such organisations, especially in combatting transnational crime. The SCO’s relevance as a Eurasian organisation is poised to further its economic interest through its connectivity projects and collaboration among private corporate players by providing a conducive environment to invest while dealing with larger security issues arising from terrorism threats. The organisation would remain relevant as a geopolitical and geo-economic vehicle to allow member states to pursue their common interests in an era of strategic flux. \nNepal experiences nearly 80 percent of its total annual precipitation during the monsoon season, which normally spans from June to September. The monsoon is a double-edged sword for the country, bringing blessings and hardships. On the positive side, the rains sustain agriculture, replenish vital water resources and support the livelihoods of millions in rural areas. However, the same torrential rains also unleash destructive floods and landslides, causing significant damage to life, property and infrastructure. The situation is often exacerbated by human-induced factors, such as unplanned urbanisation, deforestation and poorly managed infrastructure development, which obstruct the natural water flow and worsen the impact of monsoon-related disasters.In 2024, Nepal experienced record-breaking rainfall in September, surpassing a 50-year precedent. The heavy rains triggered severe floods and landslides across the country, with 26 of Nepal's 77 districts being severely affected. In response to the scale of the devastation, the government declared these districts disaster crisis zones, allowing for a faster mobilisation of resources and relief efforts. The floods damaged roads, destroyed bridges, disrupted drinking water supplies and crippled telecommunications networks, leaving thousands of people stranded and vulnerable. Moreover, 16 hydropower plants, responsible for generating 667.9 MW of electricity, were severely damaged, along with key transmission lines, further crippling Nepal's already fragile energy sector.The human toll of the disaster was profound. A total of 244 lives were lost, 19 people were reported missing, and 179 others were injured. Over 17,774 individuals were rescued by government and security forces, including the Nepal Army, Armed Police Force and local volunteers. Despite their efforts, relief distribution was slow, leaving many families waiting for essential assistance. The government pledged Rs200,000 in compensation to families who had lost loved ones, and financial support was directed to local units for disaster management. However, the sheer scale of the disaster overwhelmed the government's capacity to respond effectively.The economic consequences of the disaster were equally devastating. The estimated financial losses exceeded Rs17 billion, with damage of Rs6 billion in the agriculture sector alone. As agriculture is the backbone of Nepal’s rural economy, the disruption is expected to increase food imports, further widening the country's trade deficit. The energy sector, already under strain, suffered Rs4 billion worth of damages, which will likely force Nepal to import electricity from India to compensate for the loss in hydropower production. Additionally, tourism, another vital sector of the economy, was negatively impacted, and the increased budgetary pressure on the government will worsen an already delicate fiscal situation.As a result of the disaster, Nepal’s GDP is projected to contract by 1 percent, representing a loss of Rs57 billion. This will also reduce the country’s economic growth rate, which was previously estimated at 4.9 percent by the Asian Development Bank. With the increased debt obligations and a growing trade deficit, Nepal's economic outlook remains precarious.The international community responded swiftly to Nepal’s crisis. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed solidarity with Nepal, assuring that India would stand by Nepal in its time of need and offer all possible cooperation to help overcome the disaster. India, Nepal’s immediate neighbour, quickly dispatched essential supplies, including medicines, food, hygiene products and emergency equipment. India's significant role in Nepal’s disaster management has been recognised globally, particularly for its assistance during the 2015 and 2023 earthquakes in Jajarkot. China also expressed condolences for the human casualties and property losses caused by the disaster. Additionally, China provided emergency supplies, including blankets, rice, and other essential goods for those affected. Other countries, such as the United Kingdom and Russia, also expressed their grief. Beyond bilateral support, international organisations also played a critical role in disaster relief efforts. The World Bank approved $150 million in emergency funding to support victims affected by the floods and landslides. Numerous other donor agencies and countries offered financial aid, highlighting the global concern for Nepal’s plight.However, the disaster emphasised significant weaknesses in Nepal’s disaster preparedness. The damage was intensified by inadequate infrastructure and unregulated construction in vulnerable areas. The government’s short-term rescue and relief efforts weren’t that effective, and long-term planning to address disaster risk reduction remains largely underdeveloped.Monsoon-induced disasters are not a new challenge for Nepal; however, climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of such events. The 2024 floods underscore the urgent need for comprehensive disaster management policies that prioritise disaster preparedness, sustainable urban development, and environmental conservation.Moving forward, the Nepali government must focus on several critical areas. First, enhancing early warning systems is essential to ensure communities receive timely information about potential floods and landslides. Second, investing in flood management infrastructure—such as embankments, retention basins and better drainage systems—helps mitigate the effects of heavy rainfall. Third, construction activities should be regulated in flood-prone areas to prevent the uncontrolled development that often leads to increased disaster vulnerability.Additionally, Nepal must also focus on sustainable land-use practices. Reforestation initiatives and the promotion of sustainable agriculture can help restore ecosystems and reduce the risk of landslides while also improving the resilience of rural communities to future monsoon-induced disasters. Furthermore, long-term collaboration with international donors and organisations will be critical in rebuilding stronger and more resilient communities.Nepal can draw valuable lessons from past mistakes to inform proactive measures for the future. Prioritising disaster risk reduction and investing in sustainable development, Nepal can better prepare for the monsoon season and ensure that rainfall’s benefits are maximised while minimising the devastating consequences of floods and landslides. \nTorrential rains in the last week of September caused devastation in many parts of the country. The death toll of the calamity crossed 200, thousands have been homeless, and the damage it has inflicted upon the national economy is still to be fully assessed. When disasters strike Nepal, the presence of the government in rescue and relief operations is usually symbolic: An earthmoving equipment here, an army unit there, or a team of bewildered police personnel at some places trying to cope with emergencies that they are neither trained nor equipped to handle. In a coping mechanism that is charitably called “the resilience of Nepali people”, the affected population is often back on its feet through individual efforts. Even though somewhat muted, the Hindu novena of Dashain was celebrated, and the preparations for the five-day-long Tihar festivities have already begun. Several squatters managed to reassemble their damaged shanties themselves in the floodplains soon after the rains subsided. Houses submerged due to overflowing drains in low-lying localities have been cleaned up through individual and community efforts. But in a testament to the apathy of all three tiers of the republican order in the country, debris deposited by floods continue to decompose in the riverbed, and plastic waste lifted by torrents still flutter like flags from branches of trees and lamp posts all along the Bagmati Corridor. Had the federal government considered it an emergency, an army team would have been deployed to clear the garbage from roads along the riverbed in the Kathmandu Valley within few days. The provincial government of Bagmati needed no new laws to show its presence during a calamity—even a symbolic act of the chief minister working with a shovel would have conveyed an uplifting message. Shamed into action, the Lalitpur metropolitan government has called upon its citizens to volunteer for the clean-up drive. It’s still not too late for the celebrity Mayor Balendra Shah to follow the lead of his senior colleague.Cultural rootsDespite loud claims to the contrary, almost all religions with their “packaged superstitions”—including political religions such as communism and free-market fundamentalism—are regressive, and Hinduism is no exception. With an established tradition of karma, vacuous pride in traditions and institutionalised inequality of caste hierarchy, it is harder for a republican order to take root in societies where the Sanatan Dharma is the dogma. If Hindu monarchs of the past were avatars of Vishnu, elected leaders seem to get away with characterisations such as “Durga astride a tiger” or a human being “not born biologically”. One doesn’t question a divine being even when the person must acquire political legitimacy through the popular mandate of lesser mortals. The transactional relationships of patronage and support between politicians and their followers aren’t uncommon, but the unquestioned loyalty of the herd to its shepherd perhaps owes its origin to the tribal instinct and religious beliefs extant in many societies.It seems the citizenry in Nepal get so little from their government and yet don’t complain because they have been conditioned to demand nothing from the representatives other than some personal favours in lieu of allegiance—an appointment, a contract or some assistance in favourably resolving a dispute—once in a while. Let alone integrity, even civility and decency are seldom expected from politicos who exercise control over the resources and instruments of the state. When the citizenry is apathetic, Premier Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli can easily get away with a questionable largesse from an oligarch under investigation to build the headquarters of the ruling party. Despite his past entanglements—OMNI scandal, links with Yeti Group, Giri Bandhu land swap case, profligate actions and outrageous outbursts—Sharma Oli remains the unquestioned supremo of the CPN-UML and an idolised chieftain of the Khas-Arya ethnonationalists across party lines.Former Deputy Prime Minister and Chair of Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), Rabi Lamichhane, has been arrested and remanded into custody for further investigations of serious charges on judicial orders. The Supreme Court had once removed him from the office of the deputy prime minister and ousted him from the membership of the parliament for violating citizenship laws. In any other country, it would have meant the end of a political career, but in the land of “Never ending peace and love” that is Nepal, Lamichhane continues to command the fierce loyalty of White Shirts and “People Like Us” (PLUs) of the urban middle class.In a society where piety is more prevalent than virtue and rituals are more valued than rationality, it’s extremely difficult to institutionalise republican principles of liberty, equality, fraternity and secularity. No wonder followers blindly line up in support of their petty, populist and ‘elected monarchs’ such as Sharma Oli, Lamichhane, Shah, or even the Mayor of Dharan sub-metropolitan city Harka Sampang. In a deeply rooted culture of piety and fealty, a political manipulator can get away with anything as long as he—leadership is a male bastion—manages to dupe the flock with his bluster and bombast.Economic compulsionsHardcore adherents of republicanism may disagree, but just as authoritarianism is intrinsic to monarchism, financial improprieties are integral to almost all electoral systems that reward their winners with enormous authority to disburse concessions and distribute freebies to oligarchs who have funded their rise to power. Legal theorist Camila Vergara recognises the “systemic corruption” and argues that grassroot assemblies independent of political parties and representative government can help establish an “anti-oligarchic republic” of plebians. However, it’s not unusual for uncanny oligarchs to exploit grassroots movements.It was argued that the Tea Party movement morphed into Trumpism with Trump agreeing that it “still exists — except now it’s called Make America Great Again.” Even though Arvind Kejriwal was the direct beneficiary of Anna Hazare’s India Against Corruption (IAC) campaign of the PLUs in India, it also prepared the ground for the phenomenal spread of Hindutva politics. There is undoubtedly some merit in Ram Manohar Lohia’s roar in Hindi, “Agar sadkein khamosh ho jayein tau Sansad awaara ho jati hai (If the streets fall silent, the Parliament goes berserk)”. But irrespective of its plebian, oligarchic or liberal antecedents, all republics have to ultimately go to the polls to acquire or renew their legitimacy. Civic movements are necessary but not sufficient for the functioning of a republic.No matter how well designed an electoral system is, polls are always skewed in favour of political parties with competitively large purses. The temptation of fresh entrants into the electoral fray to fall for dubious domestic or foreign contributions is thus understandable even if not acceptable. There is no easy treatment for the endemic disease of democratic systems, but perhaps institutionalisation through broadening of the support base and continuous correction of political parties can help alleviate painful symptoms.Building a sustainable and responsible political party is a work of generations that requires an ideological commitment of organisers and supporters alike. When people pay, parties will be forced to become accountable. Premier Sharma Oli’s alleged plans to ease party splits through an ordinance are not just shortsighted but downright dangerous. Ambitious politicos need to discard their privileges if they wish to build new platforms for themselves.  \nChildren of all ages have mobile phones in their hands these days. Many of them learn about alphabets or numbers even before enrolling in schools. Although the internet offers avenues for children’s development, things can quickly go awry online. In the digital landscape, children are regularly exposed to things that aren’t accessible in real life. While children are more tech-savvy than ever, there is a glaring lack of awareness on the potential dangers of the virtual world. According to a report by The Guardian, each year, more than 300 million children worldwide become victims of online sexual exploitation and abuse. In Nepal, in under two months of the fiscal year 2024-2025, the Cyber Bureau recorded 68 cybercrime cases involving children. It logged 635 cases in the previous fiscal year, 2023-24—a 260.8 percent rise from the 176 cases in the fiscal year 2022-23. This is concerning for a nation where per capita internet usage is greater than in some developed nations even as its digital literacy rates are low. Many Nepali parents do not hesitate to give their devices to their children to keep them engaged. This practice is hardly shocking in a country where most parents themselves are digitally illiterate. This exposes the children to harmful online spaces at a very young age. Children are naturally curious and seek validation, so people easily manipulate them online. Predators groom them into sharing nudes and personal information and even meeting in real life. The offences can turn into blackmail and threats or sextortion, where abusers demand money from the victim to keep images private, scarring the children for life. Usually, the number of crime reports does not reflect the reality as many children keep it to themselves and suffer silently. These days, children are often more comfortable making friends online than in real life. There are ample online dating and chatting sites, gaming apps and social media platforms where one can communicate with strangers. In many cases, online sexual abuse culminates in real-life sexual violence. According to a Post report, a 13-year-old girl was sexually abused online and later raped by a 20-year-old man whom she met through an online gaming app, FreeFire. With the rise of Artificial Intelligence, child sexual exploitation online is taking new heights with deepfake and other generative AI content. According to the Internet Watch Foundation, the amount of AI-made illegal content related to child sexual abuse over the past six months has already exceeded the previous year’s total. Moreover, it also states how the dark web isn’t the only problem, as almost all the content found was on publicly available areas online. While Nepal has implemented laws to combat online child abuse, these regulations are nowhere near enough to oversee the rapidly evolving technologies. The Electronic Transactions Act 2008 does not explicitly address online child sexual abuse. Moreover, the Act Relating to Children 2018 fails to define child pornography, grooming, sextortion or cyberstalking, which are recurring activities involved in online child sexual abuse. The Ministry of Women, Citizens and Senior Citizens in 2021 approved the Online Child Protection Procedure in 2021, where restricting children’s access to harmful content online was stated as the duty of internet service providers; however, that hasn’t been effective. This is why it is vital that our legal mechanisms are strengthened and simple and accessible child-friendly online safety resources created. Additionally, it is imperative to spread awareness of online abuse and sexual exploitation through school curriculums. As children are exposed to online risks, even within the comfort of their homes, parents must realise that safeguarding them in the physical world is not enough. \nFlight delays lasting hours or even days have become the unfortunate norm for anyone flying with an aircraft of the Nepal Airlines Corporation (NAC), the country’s national flag carrier. On Saturday, for instance, its ‘Sagarmatha’ narrow-body aircraft flew from Delhi after a 19-hour delay due to oil filter issues, while the ‘Lumbini’ experienced a three-hour delay after its computer system malfunctioned en route to Dubai. Meanwhile, the wide-body ‘Annapurna’ has been grounded at the Tribhuvan International Airport since last Thursday due to engine trouble, while another wide-body, ‘Makalu’, is undergoing maintenance in Italy. These incidents have left countless passengers stranded at airports, both at home and abroad.Technical disruptions are nothing new to Nepal Airlines, but these recent problems have compounded the carrier’s woes. Such failures have inconvenienced passengers, raised concerns about their safety, tarnished the corporation’s image and burdened it with huge losses. For instance, a high-profit route like Kathmandu-Narita (Japan) has been disrupted, which would otherwise have brought in around Rs20 million for the airlines on normal days. Moreover, due to the grounding of the Makalu aircraft in Italy, the airlines is losing Rs20 million daily in its business. It also has the added burden of accommodating passengers whose flights were delayed and whose tickets to connecting flights had to be rebooked at exorbitant prices. If this state of affairs continues, it is only a matter of time before the inevitable question arises: Why do we need this white elephant of an organisation? The problems don’t end with technical issues. As concerning is the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal’s (CAAN) dereliction of duty, which has pushed Nepal further back on the EU Air Safety List. Nepal’s airlines don’t meet international safety standards and are therefore barred from European skies. The European Council’s long-standing concern has been over the CAAN’s failure to “enhance the safety of flyers”. Nepal’s civil aviation body still plays the dual roles of regulator and service provider. Lack of safety is bad for business too. Aviation experts say safety concerns are one reason Australia is yet to approve the landing of Nepali carriers on its soil. Again, if the airlines cannot reliably operate on these potentially lucrative routes, what is the point of having an international airliner operator? The UN’s International Civil Aviation Organisation and other aviation watchdogs have called for a complete overhaul of CAAN, recommending that it be split into two entities. Political manoeuvring, however, is halting the passage of the CAAN reform bill that is currently stuck in Parliament. Meanwhile, the top management of Nepal Airlines is engaged in an endless blame-game of who is responsible for its sorry plight. It seems like our government stakeholders in aviation are simply uninterested in having safe skies or in increasing the quality of service of our national flag carrier. Nepal Airlines came into operation in 1958, two years before Thai Airways. The former is barely functional with a juddering fleet of six while the latter is thriving with a fleet-footed fleet of 79. This might not be an exact comparison. What we can say with more certainty is that for a remittance- and tourism-dependent economy, the path Nepal Airlines is charting leads to a dead end.  \nGiven the mountain of evidence piled up by the special parliamentary probe committee to establish his involvement in the misappropriation of funds of various cooperatives, the arrest of Rabi Lamichhane, the Rastriya Swatantra Party chief and former deputy prime minister and home minister, was inevitable. Misusing the funds of hundreds of thousands of poor depositors, most of whom occupy the lowest rungs of the national economic ladder, is the most dastardly crime. We thus hope that those named by the committee, including Lamichhane, are brought to book. But that is not enough. Following Lamichhane’s arrest, his supporters have been blaming the government of being motivated by personal vendetta against the RSP chair. As evidence, they point to Nepali Congress vice-president Dhanaraj Gurung and CPN-UML federal lawmaker Rishikesh Pokharel, who, they allege, are being let off the hook despite their involvement in similar scandals.Gurung is accused of abetting the misappropriation of funds from a Lalitpur-based cooperative. He reportedly helped his ex-wife, Joyti Gurung, embezzle around Rs12.5 million. Similarly, there are accusations that Pokharel, the CPN-UML leader who is also the chair of Parliament’s Public Accounts Committee, helped his wife, Anjala Koirala, embezzle as much as Rs120 million from a Morang-based cooperative. Apparently, the Congress-UML government is using all its power to save them from prosecution. Whether that is the case, these critics of the government do have a point. To show that the government machinery is not targeting a single person or party, the allegations against the top Congress and UML leaders should also be thoroughly investigated and the respective parties must help with such probes. The larger goal here is not only to punish particular people like Lamichhane or GB Rai, Lamichhane’s partner-in-crime at Galaxy 4k TV run by the Gorkha Media Network. It is rather to clean up the cooperative sector, one of the three pillars of the national economy. Moreover, the prosecution of Lamichhane will seem credible only if there is also an impartial investigation of the allegations against top leaders affiliated with the ruling coalition. Thankfully, at least in Gurung’s case, the Central Investigation Bureau of the Nepal Police is already looking into his involvement in the Lalitpur-based cooperative. But what is the Congress doing on the matter? In the case of Pokharel, it would be wise of the UML to conduct an internal investigation. The law enforcement agencies can then take over. Such an initiative of the prime minister’s party would buttress the public image of both the UML and the country’s executive head. Given the widespread cynicism with the state machinery, it has become vital to restore some public faith in it. That is difficult when the prime minister himself accepts gargantuan donations to establish a party office. Such gestures signal that PM Oli considers himself above the law. There is growing skepticism of the government representatives’ commitment to the people, or of their ability to work impartially. If some people are prosecuted while others facing similar charges are spared, even genuine cases of cooperatives frauds like those involving former home minister Lamichhane will seem a suspect. Prime Minister Oli and his coalition partners know that well, don’t they?   \nDuring his term as home minister in the previous Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government that was toppled in mid-July, Narayan Kaji Shrestha, who is also senior vice-chair of the CPN (Maoist Centre), undertook some bold actions. He swung into action on high profile corruption cases such as Bhutanese refugee scam, Lalita Niwas land grab and cross-border gold smuggling. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal met him on Sunday to ask him of the performance of the new government, the saga around the arrest of Rastriya Swatantra Party chair Rabi Lamichhane.CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, as leader of the main opposition party, convened a joint meeting of opposition parties on Friday. It seems the opposition parties want to solidify their unity against the ruling coalition. What will be the opposition camp’s strategy to build pressure on the government?The government has not been effective in relief distribution, rehabilitation and reconstruction in the areas ravaged by the devastating floods and landslides in the last week of September. Therefore, we convened the meeting to draw the government’s attention to this sorry state of affairs. Second, right since the formation of this government [in mid-July], we suspected this coalition would play a negative role in terms of controlling corruption as the present coalition partners joined hands after being scared of the anti-corruption movement launched by our government [led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal]. It has become imperative to stop the government from doing wrong things and alert the people. Third, there are suspicions that the government is preparing to make it easier for dissident groups in various parties to split political parties by amending the Political Parties Act-2017 through an ordinance. Thus, we basically wanted to press the government to effectively carry out the post-disaster rehabilitation works and stop it from various wrongdoings.Are there specific issues on which the opposition camp wants to build pressure?Effective work on rehabilitation and reconstruction in the disaster-hit areas is our immediate demand. In the long-run, we want to raise the agenda of good governance because developing Nepal as a prosperous country and ensuring social justice should be our central mission. But this isn’t possible without first curbing rampant corruption. Unfortunately, the government is taking a negative approach in this connection.Could you give more specific details where the government went wrong in terms of corruption?To take the latest example, the CPN-UML, which is headed by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, recently accepted a donation of land worth tens of millions of rupees from Min Bahadur Gurung, owner of the country’s largest retail chain, Bhatbhateni Supermarket. The business tycoon has also announced plans to make a building for the party. During our tenure, the government filed a corruption case against him in Lalita Niwas land scam. He was arrested and later the Special Court convicted him of corruption. The land has already been retained as government property. Later, he moved the Supreme Court, where the case is sub judice. Prime Minister Oli had earlier vented his ire for arresting and filing a case against Gurung. We had suspected that he had done something wrong in collusion with Gurung. Oli’s acceptance of the property in the name of donation is unacceptable on political and moral grounds. It is against the good governance drive we launched. You know, we had initiated action in various major corruption scams during our tenure. There are reports that the government is trying to give clean chit to the accused instead of taking the process ahead. Thus the present coalition is working against good governance.In the meeting of the opposition coalition on Friday, Rastriya Swatantra Party chair Rabi Lamichhane, who was arrested on Saturday, sought support of other opposition parties [based on the information that he was being arrested] arguing that action against him was politically motivated. Will the opposition parties support him?Any case should be independently and fairly investigated. No culprit should be spared. At the same time, no political bias should reflect in the investigation. We can’t say anything about the government agencies’ investigation process. The meeting stressed on the same. It was during my tenure as home minister that the government initiated the investigation against Lamichhane after a supplementary case was registered at the Kaski District Police Office, accusing him of misusing deposits from a Kaski-based cooperative. Later, the parliament formed a special probe committee to investigate. Now the home ministry has taken action against him based on the recommendation of the same panel. We have to cooperate with the government in its investigation. The only thing we can say is that the investigation should be fair and independent. No political party can stand against the investigation itself. How do you see the protests by the RSP cadres following his arrest?They can raise their voice against the possibility of political revenge in the case and demand fair investigation. But they have to cooperate in the investigation and accept the findings. No one can obstruct the investigation just because someone is a politician. The government agencies can’t enforce rule of law if all political parties start protesting against investigations on individuals affiliated to them. A few of the RSP’s concerns are valid too. They argue that the government is working in a discriminatory way. For instance, there are reports with evidence showing involvement of some Nepali Congress and CPN-UML leaders in various cooperatives’ scams. They have asked why the government is not taking any action against them. This is a valid question. The authorities should take action against Congress and UML leaders as well to prove that the government is not discriminatory.Various high-profile corruption cases were prosecuted during your tenure as home minister. You understand if a case has been built on strong or weak grounds. From that perspective, what is your observation of Lamichhane’s case?Rabi ji himself has accepted a level of involvement in the case and said that he is ready to bear the financial liability of the cooperative money invested in the Gorkha Media Network [where he was managing director]. I can comment about the overall case only after the investigation is completed.The fact that over half-a-dozen home ministers since 1990 have been prosecuted in corruption cases shows powerful politicians are involved in corruption. Can this deep-rooted corruption be cleaned up?It is one of the major reasons hindering Nepal’s development. Corruption is promoted by those who are in key state positions. Therefore, we often say our state agencies are influenced by comprador capitalists and there is no investment in productive sectors that would create jobs. Our entire economic ecosystem of creating demand, production, supply and employment has failed. The nexus between powerful politicians, bureaucrats and a handful of business tycoons is promoting activities from where they get huge commissions, and where they get to exploit state coffers. Nepal can’t progress without breaking this nexus. We had taken strong actions in that direction. Unfortunately, the present coalition stopped that process and the comprador capitalists have yet again become active.You must have faced pressure from the political and other quarters when you took action against powerful leaders. Could you give some examples of such pressure?You know, though our party led the government, the other party [Nepali Congress] was the bigger force in the coalition government and actions were taken against the major leaders of the coalition partners. Even those who were affiliated to our party faced actions. So, definitely I faced immense political pressure. But no one could stop me as I was determined to complete my mission of good governance. But a section of people accuse you of sparing individuals close to top leaders and that some individuals were later freed on bail as the cases against them weren’t built as strongly.That is not the case. I pushed the cases despite huge political pressures. But the court later freed them on bail, where we have no role. The court has put some individuals behind bars while some were released. The role of the court is certainly a matter of research. You are right that people wonder why more powerful people aren’t brought under investigation even in big scams such as Bhutanese refugee scam and Lalita Niwas land grab. Media reports indicating powerful individuals’ involvement might be true. However, the government agencies can’t take action against anyone without sufficient evidence. Many have asked why two former prime ministers—Madhav Kumar Nepal and Baburam Bhattarai—were not prosecuted. The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) didn’t recommend action against them saying that the policy decisions made in Cabinet meetings don’t fall under its jurisdiction. And, it is still unclear which decisions made in the Cabinet are policy decisions and which aren’t.The secretaries who prepare proposals for Cabinet decisions are held responsible while the ministers who present the same proposals for a decision at the Cabinet meeting and the chief of the Cabinet are not held responsible. People have raised questions about this practice. I think this is a valid question and should be addressed properly. I also believe the ministers who present a proposal for a decision should be held responsible.Also questions were raised over the way the statements of the two prime ministers [Nepal and Bhattarai] were recorded at their homes and in the absence of a government attorney.I take this criticism positively. When I enquired about this episode, police told me that they did so because the CIAA had earlier recorded other former prime ministers at their homes and the police followed the same precedent. In the future, we should be careful. There is one crucial aspect in this case. The two prime ministers weren’t prosecuted in the Lalita Niwas land grab case. But the court has proved that the land deal was wrong. So, it has been recovered as government property. Thus, the decisions taken from the Cabinet meetings [chaired by Nepal and Bhattarai] were wrong. Don’t they need to do public self-criticism?Let’s move on to party politics. As in the past, leaders in your party rigorously discussed the issue of leadership change in Maoist Centre in recent meetings. But nothing happened. Do you see any chance of leadership change in the Maoist Centre?In our recent party meetings, we discussed whether the party’s transformation is more important or leadership change. We need a more unified, transformed and stronger party to implement our party’s agenda in national politics. This is more important. We discussed whether our leadership at present is obstructing this process. Our leadership is ready to work to transform the party, make the organisation stronger and then hand over the leadership. Our chair wants to take the party back to its past strength. We have taken his spirit positively. But this doesn’t mean that Prachanda [Dahal] is irreplaceable.Amid reports about reunification between various Maoist parties, party chairman Dahal and Nepal Communist Party General Secretary Netra Bikram Chand have both spoken on the need for such reunification. Is it happening soon?Our conclusion is that our party can take leadership in carrying out important national tasks. In principle we are in the right direction but the party can’t accomplish the tasks in its present form. So it needs to be made stronger. The ideological and moral grounds of our party have eroded. We have been distanced from downtrodden communities while party leaders have increased proximity with the well-off class. On the other hand, corruption has increased within the party. Therefore, we want to transform the party into a more revolutionary and stronger force. This should be the priority. But even after that, our party’s present strength alone will not suffice to accomplish important national tasks. So we have decided to join hands with more left and Maoist forces. Discussions with various groups for party unity and forging alliances are underway.Reports say the negotiation with the Chand-led party is more positive.The [Chand-led] party made two important decisions from a central committee meeting. They decided to go for party unity and take part in the next general elections. This is an important policy departure of the party. It has increased the possibility of party unity. But we haven’t reached any definite conclusion in this connection. Do you see any chances of forging a working alliance with new forces such as the RSP?The new forces raised an agenda [of good governance] and got good support from the public in elections. But people have already started complaining against them saying that they didn’t work as per their promises. They have started comparing them to traditional forces. The new leaders from whom people had expected a lot have already courted controversy. Having said that, we can’t brush aside the public disenchantment towards major political forces as well.The RSP champions an agenda which is quite different from what the Maoist Centre lobbies for. For instance, the policies the Maoist Centre and the RSP advocate on the federal system are opposite. In this context, can the two parties be long-term allies?The RSP has failed to be honest to the agenda it championed in the elections and to make its political ideology clear. And it has adopted a wrong policy on the federal system. Therefore, at present, we can’t say that we will have a long-term strategic collaboration. There is no reliable basis for that. As far as a working alliance is concerned, it can be with any party. For instance, we have diametrically opposed political viewpoints with the Rastriya Prajatantra Party. They want monarchy while we are strongly for the republic system. They are against federalism while we want a stronger federal system. But we can still forge a working alliance with them on certain agendas.Opposition parties seem quite scared of ordinance on Political Parties Act-2017. There is a need to end the legal void that exists after Congress-Maoist Centre government issued an ordinance three years ago. Is it based on the information about certain provisions that the government is implementing or because it is being brought by bypassing the parliament?It is true that there has been delay in reviving the provisions of the law that were inactivated after introduction of the ordinance at the time. We want that to be done through parliament. Now the government wants to make changes in it because it wants to meet certain vested political interests through it. There are suspicions that the present government leadership is working to split small parties and make the UML the largest in the House of Representatives.Why would Congress help the prime minister bring an ordinance that would make it smaller than the UML?That is why they might be at loggerheads over the issue. What I heard is that both the proposals to arrest Rabi Lamichhane and to issue the ordinance on the Political Parties Act-2017 were discussed in the same Cabinet meeting. The Congress reportedly pushed for the proposal on Lamichhane while the prime minister was for issuing the ordinance as well. It is certain that there is a tug of war between the two sides over the ordinance. \nCentral and eastern parts of Nepal witnessed devastating incidents of landslides and floods last week. At least 244 people were killed, while 19 are still missing. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Basanta Raj Adhikari, director at the Centre for Disaster Studies, Institute of Engineering at Tribhuvan University, to discuss how the country can be better prepared to manage the disasters and minimise damages.Recently we faced disastrous floods and landslides. How do you analyse the losses? Could the damages have been reduced with better preparation and timely response?To begin with, I want to make one thing clear. There is a fundamental difference between a disaster and hazard. Hazard is always natural but it becomes a disaster if there is human involvement. If there is a landslide in a jungle with no human activity, it is a hazard. If a landslide hit a human settlement and it required external involvement to restore the place, then it becomes a disaster. An earthquake is a hazard but it becomes a disaster when man-made structures kill people. As far as the losses from the recent floods are concerned, we could have minimised them with better preparation. For instance, Nakkhu was one of the worst hit areas in the Kathmandu Valley. The river there has drastically narrowed and a human settlement has been developed on the riverbanks in recent years. Human activities in rivers are natural as human civilisations took place on the banks of rivers. But it should be done without disrupting the natural flow of the water. We developed huge settlements encroaching the riverbanks. This invited huge losses. Such activities could have been avoided.As Nepal witnessed record-high rainfalls, were not these losses to be expected? It is true that the country witnessed record rainfalls this season, the highest in the past over five decades. Climate change has caused extreme weather events in recent years. But we can’t blame only natural factors. If you see the images of 2003, it clearly shows that the place where the MediCity Hospital now stands is clearly the floodplain of the Nakkhu river. If you go further downstream, you see a colony. This is how we have encroached riverbanks. We can encroach rivers but it should be done in a scientific way. What is scientific encroachment of rivers?We can model flooding based on the highest volume of water a river can carry. Based on such evidence, we can decide what kind of activities can and cannot be carried out on a riverbank. We can develop settlements but that should be based on scientific evidence and data. Another important concept we should follow is risk sensitive land use planning. Nepal government has already prepared land use maps of all the 753 local units that give vital information about a particular place such as the soil, land capability, risk layer, present land use map, zoning map and cadastral layer. But some people have stopped the authorities from implementing the maps as once they are passed, a land categorised as an agricultural area cannot be converted into commercial land. If that scheme is implemented, one can’t build a house in high flood land. Now the local authorities enforce only the building codes and that don’t include these provisions. That doesn’t inquire whether a building is being built on a riverbank or a landslide susceptible area. In developed countries, those who build in high flood risk areas have to pay more in insurance. Also, areas are categorised based on the chances of occurrence of landslides on the basis of soil type, rock type, geology, distance from a drainage or a road etcetera and structures built there are dealt with accordingly. We are witnessing extreme weather events. In this context, what should we do to prevent more loss in the days ahead?We require an engineering paradigm shift in building infrastructures. The extreme weather patterns have made the data we used to refer to in the past while building infrastructures irrelevant. The data on water levels that were referred to while making a bridge in a river now need to be updated as water levels in our rivers have been rising in recent years. The existing infrastructures can’t withstand that volume of water. We witnessed record rainfalls last week. This can be a reference data for some years. Also, the sedimentation pattern has changed because of human settlements built upstream.Second, we have a generalised rule of building roads across the country. The impact of 200 millilitres of rainfall in Pokhara and rainfall of the same volume in Jhapa is different. As Pokhara experiences rains on a regular basis, the soil in the area can withstand it because it has been weathered by regular rain but the same volume of rainfall can cause more losses in Jhapa because of weak soil there. We thus have to consider the strength of soil while building a structure in a particular place.There is a single road construction method across the country, whether the place is in a high himalayan range, Mahabharat, Shivalik hills or plains. We have to make specific rules for specific places based on the geological and soil structures. The parameters of road construction should be redefined. We are improving the weather forecasting system but now we also need impact-based forecasting to inform the public not only about the volume of likely rainfall but also its likely impact.Where are the problems in our disaster response approach?The Natural Calamity (Relief) Act, 1982 was guided by a fatalistic approach as it saw natural hazards as destined by fate. Then came Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act, 2017. This change in law is in fact a paradigm shift in disaster management in Nepal. The new law’s perspective is progressive. The new Act changed us from response-centric to preparedness-centric. Legally, we are on a progressive path. But we lag in implementation. We also need to upgrade our skills in handling the situation. Our constitution as well as laws have entrusted local units with the responsibility of handling disaster incidents on their own. The government should make people at the local level aware, and equip and train them for the purpose.Training on some important procedures such as the INSARAG preparedness and response guidelines can be quite effective. Such training and other activities aimed at helping local units to handle disaster incidents should be conducted at the ward levels. “Understanding risk” is an important aspect in disaster management. So common people should be sensitised to the consequences of disaster incidents. You can see people collecting timber from flooded rivers, taking selfies on riverbanks and gathering on a bridge above a roaring river. People at all local wards need to be well-equipped. Those who were swept away at Nakkhu could have been saved if the security personnel and other people there had at least motorboats and life jackets. Our rescue workers now lack even such basic things.Settlements in Nepal’s mountainous and hill areas are located in equally risky zones. What should be done to safeguard them?The mountains in our region are taken as young and the Himalayan range is in the building process. It is also called an active mountain belt. Therefore, we experience frequent earthquakes. Earthquakes cause geomorphological changes. A large number of settlements in Nepal’s hills sit on the debris of old landslides that might have occurred long back. People there should be made aware of the risk and these places be identified. Engineering measures should be taken to make them safe. Scattered populations mainly in the highlands need to be integrated in concentrated settlements.What is the latest status of glaciers and glacial lakes in our mountains?The pace of glacial melting is rising alarmingly because of rising temperature. Earlier, we took only big glacial lakes as threats and gave them more attention but recent incidents showed that even smaller ones pose a threat. The incident of the Thame glacial lake outburst in August showed how the outburst of even a small glacial lake could have a cascading effect. Likewise, the deposits of landslides being piled above 3,000 metres are another serious challenge. Such sediment deposition is increasing in the mountains while there is a huge population downstream. The frequency of cascading hazards has increased, emerging as a major challenge. A landslide blocks a river and when the river breaches the structure built of debris, it causes devastating losses downstream.How can we scientifically prove that the hazards we are seeing were the result of climate change?There has to be scientific evidence to make the link. For instance, the Thame glacial outburst was clearly a climate change-induced hazard as it did not involve human activities. The treeline and snowline are shifting upwards in our mountains. There were no mosquitoes in Mustang until some years ago. Now mosquitos are widespread in the district as temperature there has significantly increased. The crop pattern has changed drastically. Thus we have a number of scientific evidence to show clear signs of climate change in this part of the world. What the government should now do is properly document these climate change-induced incidents following internationally-accepted methods and present them at relevant UN bodies. \nNepal's economy, facing setbacks since 2015, is projected to improve, according to the IMF and ADB, despite ongoing infrastructure damage, decreasing capital formation, private sector pessimism, and a reliance on remittance, tourism, and energy exports.\nThe parliamentary probe report on the cooperatives scam implicates Rabi Lamichhane and 49 others in embezzling Rs2.58 billion from multiple cooperatives, despite failing to establish direct links between Lamichhane and specific financial transactions.\nPartly cloudy weather with isolated thunderstorms forecast for Koshi and Lumbini provinces, and hilly areas; mostly fair weather elsewhere; Dhangadhi records highest temperature (37.3°C), Jumla records lowest (4.1°C); light rainfall in Biratnagar, Dharan, and Lumle.\nOn Thursday, most of Nepal faces partly cloudy to fair weather, with chances of light rain in hilly regions of Koshi and Gandaki provinces; western and local winds influence the country, with Janakpur and Jumla experiencing the highest and lowest temperatures on Wednesday.\nPartly cloudy to fair weather expected, with light rain or thunderstorms possible in hilly areas, especially in Koshi and Gandaki provinces; Janakpur warmest (37.6°C), Jomsom coldest (4.5°C).\nOn Tuesday the weather is forecast to be partly to generally cloudy in Karnali and Sudur Pashchim Province along with the hilly regions of Koshi, Bagmati and Gandaki Province and partly cloudy to mainly fair in the rest of the country.Light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is likely to occur at a few places of hilly regions of Karnali and Sudur Pashchim Province and at one or two places of hilly regions of Koshi, Bagmati and Gandaki Province.
