Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nTwo ruling parties have formed a three-tier political mechanism—at the centre, in the provinces and in the districts—in order to facilitate the government of the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML at the centre and to resolve any disputes at the provincial and district levels.Prime Minister and UML chair KP Sharma Oli and Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba will head the mechanism, according to a statement issued by the secretariat of the newly announced body on Wednesday. The first meeting of the mechanism was held on Tuesday. At the central level, they formed an eight-member team with four members from each party. Among them are the parties’ office bearers and ministers in the Oli Cabinet. However, in the provinces and districts, each party will have three representatives in the task force.The decision to form the joint mechanism is aimed at minimising the differences between the two parties, supporting the spirit of government formation agreed in mid-July when the parties came together, according to ruling party leaders.The development comes at a time when the popularity of the Oli government is dipping as it fails to revive the ailing economy, unlike what was promised in mid-July. The mechanism is also tasked with removing the obstacles to the two parties’ coalition so that it continues to govern until the elections in 2027. Formation of the mechanisms at provincial and district levels are said to be in the final stage.Vice-president Purna Bahadur Khadka, General Secretary Gagan Thapa, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba and Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak are Congress members in the task force while UML senior vice-chairman Ishwar Pokhrel, General Secretary Shankar Pokhrel, Finance Minister Bishnu Paudel and deputy general secretary Bishnu Rimal are representing Oli.The decision was made on October 31, Rimal told the Post. The objectives of the mechanism are to support and facilitate the works of the three-tier government.Representatives from the two parties will lead the mechanism by turns. Khadka of the Congress will coordinate the meetings for a month from November 5. At the provincial level, Congress provincial party chief, incumbent chief minister or the parliamentary party leader (in case the party is not leading the provincial government) and the senior member of the provincial Cabinet will be members of the task force.From the UML, provincial party chair, provincial in-charge and parliamentary party leader will be members of the task force, said Rimal. At the district level, Congress party president and two office bearers will be the members.The UML district in-charge, party chair and secretary will be represented in the task force, according to Rimal.The political mechanism also announced the visit of Prime Minister Oli to China scheduled for December 2-6. But the government is yet to make a formal announcement of the visit. At the invitation of Chinese Premier Li Qiang, prime minister Oli is paying an official visit to China in December. As per the instructions of Prime Minister Oli and Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana will coordinate the visit. The task force will lay the groundwork for the visit , the statement added. Rana has already cancelled her scheduled trip to Baku, Azerbaijan where she was to attend the 2024 United Nations Climate Change Conference. President Ramchandra Paudel is leading the Nepali delegation in the UN climate change conference. The main objective of the three-tire mechanism is to assist and support the federal, provincial and local governments, said Rimal. The provincial and district level mechanisms will resolve disputes related to government functioning, he added. “The main purpose of the mechanisms is to convince people that the government will deliver and address their needs. The mechanism will help restore trust and hope and will solidify the Congress-UML alliance,” added Rimal.Leaders said that there is good working relations between the two parties at all three levels.“This government will complete its full term. The current political Oli-Deuba partnership is doing well as there is a high level of mutual trust,” said Rimal. He said the government would stay intact so long as the trust between Oli and Deuba remains intact and so long as the UML remains a united party. \nPolitical parties have expedited their preparations for the by-elections slated for next month in various local units.The by-elections will be held on December 1 for various positions that went vacant due to various reasons after the local elections in 2022.As the Election Commission has fixed November 18 for filing the candidacy, parties are busy selecting their candidates for the 44 vacant seats ranging from the chief of the district coordination committees to the ward chairpersons.The voters from different local units will vote to elect two chiefs of the district coordination committees, chairpersons of two rural municipalities, four vice-chairs, one mayor, one deputy mayor and chairs of 34 wards. Votes will also be cast to elect chiefs of the district coordination committees in Okhaldhunga and Kailali, the mayor of Kirtipur Municipality in Kathmandu, and the deputy mayor of Nalagad Municipality in Jajarkot.Similarly, the elections will be held to elect chairpersons of Gramthan Rural Municipality in Morang and Mahabu Rural Municipality in Dailekh, and the vice-chairs of Gaurishankar Rural Municipality in Dolakha, Sarkegad Rural Municipality in Humla and Swamikartik Khapar Rural Municipality in Bajura.Additionally, elections will take place to elect ward chair positions in various local units including in the Kathmandu Metropolitan City and Kirtipur Municipality.The Local Level Election Act, 2016 envisions by-elections to fill vacant positions such as district coordination committee heads, vice-heads, rural municipality chairs, vice-chairs, mayors, deputy mayors, and ward chairs if their term has not expired and has more than a year left with for their term. The representatives in all the vacant positions were elected on May 13, 2022 with just half of their terms completed so far.Suman Ghimire, information officer at the commission, said the nominations can be filed during the office hours on November 17 and the list of candidates will be published by 6 pm the same day.Anyone who has an objection to the candidacy of any contestant can lodge the complaint the next day. Similarly, candidates will be allowed to withdraw their candidacies, if they wish so, by 1 pm on October 20.The final list of the candidates from all the vacant positions will be published the same day while the election symbols too will be allotted between 3 pm to 5 pm on the day.“Twenty-five parties have been registered in the commission to compete in the by-polls,” said Ghimire.According to the constitutional poll management body, the mayoral and deputy mayoral candidates can spend a maximum of Rs450,000, rural municipality chairs and vice-chairs are allowed to spend up to Rs350,000 while the aspirants for the district coordination committee chief and deputy can spend up to Rs50,000.Rs300,000 is the maximum amount the candidates for metropolitan city ward chairs can spend but the ceiling is Rs200,000 and Rs150,000 for the ward chairpersons of the municipality and rural municipality, respectively.The main opposition CPN (Maoist Centre) is ahead of other major parties in candidate selection. It has decided to field Shivsharan Maharjan, a professor by profession, for the vacant mayor's position in Kirtipur Municipality. It has picked Nimleki Sherpa for the vice-chairperson position in Gaurishankar Rural Municipality of Dolakha. The third largest party has also finalised its candidates for the ward chairpersons in most of the local units where the by-polls are going to take place.The ruling CPN-UML has picked the contenders for by-elections in the local units from Kathmandu but is yet to decide for other parts. Surendra Manandhar, a UML central committee member, is the party’s mayoral candidate in Kirtipur. Laxmi Ratna Tuladhar will contest for chairperson of ward 16 of the Kathmandu Metropolis from the UML.Rajendra Gautam, publicity department chief of the second largest party, said all the party’s candidates will be finalised within a couple of days.The Nepali Congress, on the other hand, has already received lists of the probable candidates from the respective local units but is yet to finalise the names. The Rastriya Swatantra Party, which came into existence after the 2022’s local elections, is also preparing to contest the by-polls this time.All the parties, including those who had contested earlier polls forming pre-poll alliances, have announced they’d contest the upcoming elections independently. \nKaski residents have started redeveloping the Krapu Kwholasothar trail, a circuit trek of religious and historical significance that remains unexplored.Kwhlosothar, located 3,283 metres above sea level, is in the southern part of Annapurna and Lamjung. It can be reached through Tangting, Sikles, Kori and Yangjakot of Kaski and Pasgaun, Bhujung, and Ghanpokhari of Lamjung.The shortest route is from Tangting.Locals say it's not just an ordinary trekking trail for it connects Kwholasothar, an ancient village believed to be Nepal's first Gurung or Tamu settlement, with ruins of an ancient town over 1500-1200 years old.Until half a decade ago, northern Kaski and Lamjung locals used this route to bring salt from Tibet.A decade ago, a joint research team from Cambridge University of the UK and the Central Department of Geology, Tribhuvan University, studied the artefacts in Kwhlosothar.Bed Bahadur Gurung, a Gandaki provincial assembly member and former chairman of Madi rural municipality, said the trail has many historical and archaeological sites for pilgrimages for the Tamu [Gurung] people and could be an important historical attraction for Nepali and foreign trekkers.Kwhlosothar or Kohla Sothar is divided into three villages—lower, middle and upper. ‘Sothar’, in the Gurung language, means three villages. Locals and researchers say Kohla Sonthar resembles the 15th-century Inca ruins of Machu Pichu in Peru. For a long time, people have been demanding the area be declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.“There are many historical artefacts, including houses and palaces, in these three villages,” said Gurung.There are caves after walking two hours more from Kwhlosothar at the height 3,800. ‘The cave is known as ‘Chamsyo Nagra.’Gurung remembers when his father brought salt via Tangting of Kwhlosothar-Namun Bhanjyang-Larke Pass-Tibet route five decades ago.When the road from Pokhara-Butwal opened, the people of Kwhlosothar stopped going along the mountainous route.No human settlement exists above Tangting, but many sheep and buffalo herders can be found there.Gurung said that before the Annapurna Conservation Area Project was established in 1985, foreign trekkers used to go for camping treks. However, since the project didn’t include the Kwhlosothar, trekkers stopped hiking in the area and remained isolated.The project promoted Manang, Lamjung, Thorong Pass, Mustanf, Myagfi and Annapurna Base Camp, Ghandruk-Ghorepani, but Kwhlosothar remained in the shadows.In Tony Hagen's book Building Bridges to the Third World: Memories of Nepal 1950-1992, the Swiss geologist mentions his travel experience to Namun Bhanjyang, from the base of Machapuchhre to Sikles, Madi River, and Krupudanda.The trail was named the ‘Tony Hagen Trail’ after Bed Bahadur Gurung became the chairman of the Madi rural municipality to promote it.“This trail needs to be redefined to allow people to know the historical importance of the place. The provincial and local governments and tourism entrepreneurs of Lamjung, Manang, and Kaski all need to play an equal role in promoting the area,” said Gurung.The Ministry of Industry, Tourism, Forest and Environment of Gandaki Province, Nepal Tourism Board office in Pokhara have been allocating a budget to promote trails in Madi in Kaski, Kwhlosothar of Lamjung and Chame of Manang. But on the promotional front, locals say nothing has been done.The Gurung Tourism Entrepreneurs Association has named the trekking route the Gurung Heritage Trail.“As trekking trails have been losing charm due to haphazard road construction, such trails are still untouched by modern development,” said Kisham Kumari Gurung, president of the association.“These trails can draw high-end trekkers, which can create jobs and increase the income of people in the areas,” said the president. “Gurung heritage trail has a combination of nature and culture.”Gurung heritage trekking trail has been developed from Tangting to Danda-Tapro-Kwhlosothar-Thulilek-Thurju-Dudh Pokhari-Gurung Deurali-Danfe Kharka-Timang to Besi Sahar, said Bobar Jung Gurung, founding president of the association. The association's members and others recently conducted a 10-day trekking trail exploration and promotion programme.The trekking trail includes Kwhlosothar (3,283 metres); Thulilek, a vast grazing area (4,070 metres); Dudh Pokhari, a religious place (4,585 metres); Namun Bhanjyang (5,560 metres); and Danfe Kharka, a yak grazing area (3,862 metres).The Annapurna Conservation Area Project and the Trekking Agency Association of Nepal coordinated the exploration. The trekking can be completed in 12 days.As a motor road has been reached to Ghandruk and Ghorepani of Annapurna Conservation Area, reducing the charm of trekking, the new trekking trail can be an alternative, said Deepak Sapkota, a member of the Trekking Agency Association of Nepal, Gandaki.“In this area, we can revive camping trekking, which can be a big draw for trekkers.” \nThe popular social media platform TikTok has officially registered in Nepal. TikTok representatives received its registration letter from the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology on Tuesday.TikTok initiated the registration process in the second week of October in accordance with the 2023 Directives on Operation of Social Networking issued by the government. The platform has committed to following the regulation’s requirements and additional provisions mandated by a Cabinet meeting on August 22. According to the Cabinet’s decisions, TikTok must contribute to promoting tourism in Nepal, invest in digital literacy initiatives, support improvements in Nepal’s public education system, and ensure decent language use on its platform.TikTok becomes the third social media company to register with the ministry after Viber and WeChat. The government has also been urging other major social media platforms to complete the registration process.“Now our laws apply to TikTok within our territory,” said Gajendra Kumar Thakur, spokesperson for the Communications Ministry. “If any unlawful content appears on the platform, Nepal Police’s Cyber Bureau can take action with TikTok’s cooperation. TikTok has already provided certain tools to support Nepal Police in criminal investigations.”In addition to its commitment to promoting digital literacy and tourism, TikTok has designated Ram Bahadur Thapa as its main focal person for Nepal. “We have limited information about him so far, but TikTok has provided his address, phone number, and other details in its registration application,” Thakur added.The ministry has also corresponded with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and X CEO Elon Musk, requesting them to register their respective platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and X in Nepal. “Although we haven’t received responses yet, we hope these major companies will reply,” Thakur said. “If they fail to respond, we will follow up. Eventually, they must register.”The Council of Ministers has made it mandatory that social media platforms operating in Nepal must actively promote the country’s tourism, support internet and digital literacy programmes, and help enhance the quality of public education through digital cooperation in the country. The regulations also require social media companies to implement content moderation and filtering practices, remove material that could harm social harmony or spread obscenity, and aid in controlling cybercrimes.Digital rights advocates have acknowledged the importance of the registration process but have raised concerns over the content filtering requirement, warning that it could pose risks to freedom of expression. They argue that government directives should not restrict the right to expression based on the agreements reached with the private companies.The previous coalition government of the Maoist Centre and Nepali Congress, approved the social media regulations on November 9, 2023. Four days later, a Cabinet meeting chaired by Maoist Centre chief Pushpa Kamal Dahal decided to ban TikTok, citing its potential to disrupt social harmony. After nearly ten months, the incumbent government under Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli lifted the TikTok ban in August.Following the adoption of the social media guidelines, the ministry had formed a five-member social media management unit to oversee the implementation of the regulations. Last year, the unit notified platforms of their obligation to register within three months and emailed English translations of the guidelines to the companies concerned. The ministry hopes TikTok’s registration will encourage other platforms to follow suit. \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli on Thursday congratulated Donald Trump on his victory in the 2024 US presidential election.In a social media post, Oli congratulated the president-elect and described Trump’s return to office as a “historic chapter in American history.”He expressed optimism about strengthening Nepal-US relations under Trump’s leadership, highlighting a commitment to “mutual prosperity and cooperation” between the two nations.Earlier on Wednesday, President Ramchandra Paudel congratulated Trump as the Republican candidate won the election for a second term, defeating Kamala Harris of the Democratic Party.In the message shared on social media, President Paudel expressed confidence that the Nepal-US relationship would be further strengthened during Trump’s upcoming tenure.Trump was elected president, capping a remarkable comeback four years after he was voted out of the White House and ushering in a new American leadership likely to test democratic institutions at home and relations abroad, the international news agency Reuters reported.Trump, 78, recaptured the White House on Wednesday by securing more than the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the presidency. \nDonald Trump overcame them all. A felon convicted 34 times over. A pair of assassination attempts. Endorsement of Kamala Harris, his Democratic rival, by major news organisations and Hollywood A-listers. The baggage of history, whereby in the past 100 years just one other person had won a non-consecutive American presidential election. The opposition’s message that Trump harboured fascist tendencies, that he was openly misogynistic, that he had no concrete plan besides the vacuous ‘Make America Great Again’ slogan—they all fell on deaf ears. On election eve, most Americans said the economy was their top priority and they seem to have voted accordingly—never mind that the US continues to be the best performing rich economy, by a long shot. Whatever the state of the overall economy, many Americans felt their personal lives were getting worse. Harris also clearly failed to kindle hope as first-time voters, especially young men, leaned towards Trump. Arab-Americans were unhappy with US President Joe Biden’s handling of the war in Palestine, and Vice-president Harris seems to have lost many of their votes as a result. It was also interesting that more Americans saw in Trump a better presidential material than they did in Harris.So what does Trump’s triumph mean, especially for the rest of the democratic world? A few lessons emerge. One, it reinforces the message that voters are far from rational creatures and tend to vote with their hearts. Logically, compared to 2020, more Blacks voting for Trump, someone who harbours white supremacist views, does not make sense. Nor does the fact of Arab-Americans voting for Trump, who is likely to be worse when it comes to protecting the rights of the Palestinians. Even more generally, why would you choose someone who neither has the temperament nor the credentials to handle arguably the most important job in the world? But, again, in this age of social media, hard logic alone is insufficient. For example, many first-time male voters said they were persuaded to vote for Trump after watching 30-second Republican messages on TikTok. And most Americans think they are worse off today than they were four years ago, despite many indications to the contrary. Concomitantly, by appealing to people’s baser instincts, a lying Trump could capture many votes than a rather wooden but more truthful Harris.As in the US, there is a lot of disgruntlement in Nepal, especially among the youth. They feel cheated by old parties and their ageing leaders. Yet newer parties have also failed to gain their trust. Currently, it is unclear what this state of perpetual disgruntlement will lead to. Another Bangladesh, some suspect. People are looking for options to the status quo. Again, as in the US, a strongman may emerge in order to tap into this deep sense of frustration. Like Trump’s tropes, the message of these strongmen will be simple yet emotionally-laden and hence easy to gulp down in a world increasingly drowned in confusing online chatter. We often take our liberties for granted. But as the appeal of ‘democratic strongmen’ like Trump grows far and wide, those freedoms may come under jeopardy. If the US, with its strong history of check and balance, is struggling to manage a single man’s challenge to democracy, a country like Nepal with its weak institutions will be a lot more vulnerable to despotism.   \nMultilateral institutions are becoming the new reality in the geopolitical landscape. On October 22-24, Russia hosted the 16th Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS) summit at Kazan. The summit was projected as a diplomatic success for Russia, sending a message to the West that it is not isolated internationally and continues to be courted by important countries around the world. BRICS started as a group of four emerging economies in 2006 and later included South Africa in 2010. Since then, it has expanded to add new members, i.e. Saudi Arabia, Iran, Ethiopia, Egypt, Argentina and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), giving economic teeth to the organisation. BRICS comprises 41 percent of the world population, having 24 percent of the world GDP and over 16 percent share of the world trade. With the new members joining, its potential is set to increase exponentially. Relevance of BRICSEven though obituaries of the organisation have been written by analysts who argue that BRICS does not have the potential to emerge as an organisation of geopolitical relevance, it continues to be pertinent to a multipolar global order currently dominated by Western countries, which China and Russia challenge. For India, BRICS remains an important multilateral vehicle in its foreign policy. While the Western countries perceive both Russia and China as antithetical to Western values and West-dominated global order, India continues to be a linchpin in the US strategy for the Indo-Pacific.However, India has avoided a direct confrontation with China. It has underlined the importance of the Indo-Pacific Economic Forum and other pillars of cooperation, such as enhancing maritime security, counterterrorism, non-proliferation and cyber issues between the countries of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue.Multilateralism, multi-alignment and multipolarity attest to the fact that the world order is in flux. While the US-dominated international system is in crisis for failing to establish peace, an accountable international system like the BRICS, a multilateral financial institution that caters to the economic needs of developing countries or has climate governance sensitive to the requirements of the developing world, emerged as an organisation promising inclusive international order. Further, the New Development Bank, established by BRICS states, funds projects in different countries and caters to the needs of developing countries. As of 2019, the bank had funded 45 projects with loans aggregating to $12.5 billion.Critics labelled BRICS as part of a China-led global order like the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO). However, its recent expansion showed that an alternative to the US-dominated order has pushed many countries to apply for membership, despite sceptics saying the organisation has not achieved anything.Admission of new members, done by consensus, is frozen at the moment. Such a move has dejected many countries aspiring for full membership. Several South Asian countries aspire to join BRICS, and India will play an essential role in getting them on the board as and when membership is open. The organisation is also interested in partnering with Emerging Markets and Developing Countries (EMDCs). There is concern that BRICS should not emerge as a forum for geopolitical contestation, with contradictory interests that could render the organisation defunct.The member countries emphasise the global south and how strengthening multilateralism would further their interest. Given the dominance of Western powers in several organisations, the global south feels unheard. In this context, emphasising other multilateral organisations has become vital. BRICS and outreach programmes remain a critical forum for dialogue among aspiring countries. It gives the UN a central role as a global body and underlines the need for the organisation to be equitable and geographically inclusive.It needs to be underlined that the UN remains relevant along with other statutory bodies. However, the global south feels alienated as the Security Council enjoys immense power, and there is no sign of UN reform in the near future. As Brazil currently holds the presidency of the G20, it will bring issues such as sustainability, sustainable development, climate change, poverty reduction, and so on—concerns that affect the Global South—to the agenda of the G20 summit.Overall, the Kazan summit defined the essence of BRICS at a time when several multilateral forums are flourishing. It emphasises “a more representative, fairer international order, a reinvigorated and reformed multilateral system, sustainable development and inclusive growth.” While this statement embodies the aspirations of the BRICS members, the ideas remain a glue for further global cooperation.India and BRICSFor the past few years, India has been pursuing its foreign policy by being involved in several multilateral organisations. Its relationship with both Russia and China has been significant. Russia has remained a vital defence partner of India since independence. While India has diversified its defence procurement, it depends on Russia for spare parts and equipment servicing. Russian weapons have kept India in good stead. Western powers pressurised India when it decided to purchase S 400 S-400 anti-aircraft systems. Similarly, India’s purchase of Russian oil has helped its economy. For a long time, the country has been balancing its relationship with both Russia and Ukraine, given the Russia-Ukraine war, which has made Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy unhappy. The disengagement at the India-China border and the restoration of normal patrolling, following an agreement between the two countries, would benefit India. This summit facilitated a bilateral meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping on the sidelines, which contributed to the disengagement of India-China troops at the border. It is important to note that India does not want the opposition to the Western-dominated world order be replaced by a Russia-China dominated alternative international order.Multilateralism remains a key part of India’s foreign policy. The underlying theme is that it ‘does not believe in a world order where few are considered superior’. With no sight of the UN reforms, these multilateral organisations will help smaller groups of countries pursue their interest and get funding from alternative sources while being part of a UN-dominated global system. \nEconomics and economic policy need a rethink. This is clear from the scale of inequality, joblessness, insecurity and environmental disasters we see in the world. People feel left behind, impoverished and unvoiced. They are looking to ethno-nationalist strongmen to help them. Right-wing movements and governments are on the rise. As an economist who has written for many decades about debunking the neoclassical approaches to economic thinking, I think there is clear evidence that the mainstream ideas and policies no longer work.The dominant approaches to economic policy focus on a few narrow goals, such as growing gross domestic product (GDP) or suppressing inflation. The use of GDP since the late 1940s to understand the health of an economy has been criticised. What’s needed is a more precise understanding of the broad impact of macroeconomic policies, one that accounts for paid, unpaid and non-market work. The standard economic variables used by mainstream economics don’t consider all these. Mainstream policies don’t see the huge impact of unpaid care work on GDP. According to the International Labour Organisation an estimated 16.4 billion hours are spent on unpaid care work every day. This is equivalent to two billion people working eight hours a day with no remuneration.The idea of economic growth is also ill suited to evaluate improvements to well-being at the social level. Though growth in GDP can be a useful measure of economic activity, growth itself does not always bring better outcomes in terms of poverty, health or jobs. GDP growth can even worsen health status, pollute the environment, and reduce leisure time. Many countries are now starting to give indicators of well-being a central role in judging how well the economy is doing. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, such as New Zealand, have been looking at measuring societal progress in terms of how well people and households are doing.The human rights approach is another way to judge economic policies and their outcomes. It’s different from the dominant approach in economics, which is mainly interested in the ability of individuals to make choices that maximise their own individual satisfaction, termed “utility”. If, instead, the purpose of the economy was to fulfil rights, we would have a very different set of policy priorities. Like equality in the right to leisure, the right to an adequate standard of living, and the right to housing, education and health.A human rights approachThe human rights approach allows for a complex interaction between individual rights, collective rights and collective action. It sees policy as a social and political process that should conform to human rights standards. It recognises that states can both enable and deny social justice. Individuals need the power of the state to realise their rights but also need protection against misuse of state power. The human rights framework looks beyond GDP or income when evaluating economic outcomes. It looks to the realisation of economic and social rights over time. Social justice makes advances when the enjoyment of the rights to an adequate standard of living, education, health, work and social security, among others, improves over time. These aspects of the human rights framework can be used to evaluate and assess economic policies and their outcomes.Many of these human rights aspects are implicit in wellbeing indicators but are not clearly stated. The measurement of wellbeing highlights inequalities, focuses on people and outcomes at the individual and household level, and allows for an analysis of inequalities. But the criteria it uses are not well articulated, especially in terms of gender equality.The environmentOne of the serious shortcomings of an approach that regards growth as the solution to economic crisis is that continued growth has environmental limits and potentially catastrophic consequences. The larger question is whether economic growth is sustainable over time and whether it can be achieved in a sustainable way. There is some attention to sustainability within the human rights framework. For example, a clean environment is necessary for the full enjoyment of human rights. But this relationship needs to be better understood, beyond environmental crisis.The OECD has developed a series of indicators to measure wellbeing in many countries. They are: income and wealth; work and job quality; housing; health; knowledge and skills; environmental quality; subjective wellbeing; safety; work-life balance; social connection; and civil engagement. The resources for future wellbeing are natural capital, economic capital, human capital and social capital. These are attempts at considering wellbeing but are still very economistic and capital oriented. It’s necessary to go beyond looking at the negative consequences of pollution to radically shift how development is conceived. Ecuador, for example, is using the concept of Buen Vivir, which is based on indigenous traditions and values of the Andean region. It departs from western ideas of affluence and growth; instead it is about harmony with oneself, the community and nature.Some of the language around Buen Vivir is around rights, such as the right to a good life, and the rights of nature. The right to a good life includes the rights to nutrition, health, education and water, and uses the economic, social and cultural rights norms. The concept of Buen Vivir has some problems, though, like its scalability and the gender assumptions of indigenous traditions.To address the roots of people’s disenchantment and avoid ecological catastrophe, we must develop new approaches to economic policy. Instead of using growth as the measure of an economy’s health, there are other approaches to consider, like wellbeing, human rights and Buen Vivir. Each approach has its limitations. But bringing them into conversation is a start when asking the most basic of questions: What is the economy for?—The ConversationRead the original article here. \nSince taking office around three months ago, Health Minister Pradip Paudel has announced several initiatives focused on free healthcare programmes. Although these announcements appear laudable at the outset, those acquainted with our healthcare system suspect they will do more harm than good. Such a spree of free healthcare programmes is impractical in a nation where funding for even basic health facilities is scarce. Isn’t the availability of facilities a prerequisite for making them “free” to the public?Last week, Minister Paudel announced three free programmes, including free treatment for cancer patients under 14. A week before that, Paudel had pledged free care for burn victims who cannot afford treatment. But how will these be executed as hospitals lack vital resources? Every year, around 1,500 children under 14 have cancer. Many have no option but to travel abroad for treatment due to a lack of positron emission tomography (PET) scans, immunohistochemistry, bone marrow transplants and other important tests. Moreover, there is a severe shortage of support staff in health facilities. On burn care, most health facilities only provide basic treatments, compromising patient safety even as, according to the ministry, around 57,000 people are affected by it every year.Without proper budget allocation, such ambitious programmes are bound to fail. In the budget for the current fiscal year, the health sector received Rs86.24 billion, which was only a 2.5 percent increase from the previous fiscal year. With only 4.6 percent of the total budget dedicated to healthcare, experts warned about its long-term impacts, potentially affecting crucial milestones achieved over the years. Several healthcare programmes, including those related to safe motherhood, child health, nutrition, and mental health, were already impeded by the cut in the previous year’s budget. What’s more, the agencies under the ministry don’t even have the funds to provide something as basic as mental health screening training to children and adolescents. While the health minister unveils one free programme after another, the agencies under the ministry seek funds from aid agencies to carry them forward. At a press conference 100 days after assuming office, Paudel claimed that federal hospitals are now better organised and he would now focus on health insurance reform. However, his promise to do away with long waiting lines at state hospitals within a month and raise the coverage of the government’s health insurance scheme to Rs500,000 have yet to be realised. Such long queues reflect the poor healthcare accessibility, with facilities mostly Kathmandu-centric. Over the years, patient numbers have increased exponentially, even while there has been no rise in human resources in state-run hospitals in the past three decades. All of these reflect how misguided and superficial these health-related commitments are. In yet another example of incompetence, the health ministry released a circular in September to operate outpatient services on public holidays. How is this sustainable in a system where doctors are already overworked and offered no extra incentives?Perhaps the health minister should focus more on using available funds to push the current healthcare programmes than on starting more ambitious initiatives. Nepalis have had their fill of populist vows that disregard their well-being, especially in an area as basic as healthcare. Government representatives would do well not to make lofty promises that adds burden on our already overworked healthcare providers.  \nA threat by Donald Trump, who has been elected as the next US president, to impose 60% tariffs on US imports of Chinese goods poses major growth risks for the world’s second-largest economy.Not only are the tariff rates much higher than the 7.5%-25% levied on China during his first term, the economy is also in a much more vulnerable position.This is what is different:Property market crisisIn 2018, the property market was strong, driving about a quarter of China’s economic activity. That meant local government finances, heavily reliant on auctioning land for residential projects, were not questioned so forcefully. This helped China absorb the tariff shock. But since 2021, real estate has been in a severe downturn and local government revenues have plunged.Housing oversupply means this sector may never return to the driving seat of Chinese economic growth. DebtThe property sector’s downturn has saddled local governments with unsustainable debt.While Beijing is lining up fiscal help for them to curb their liabilities, the burden is huge, limiting China’s ability to respond to any external growth shocks. The International Monetary Fund calculates total government sector debt at 147 trillion yuan ($20.7 trillion) at the end of 2023. Add household and corporate debt and that number surpasses 350 trillion yuan - roughly three times the size of the economy, according to the Bank for International Settlements.Weak domestic demandLow wages and pensions, high youth unemployment and a feeble social safety net leave China’s household spending below 40% of GDP, about 20 percentage points behind the global average.Boosting that requires either more debt or an overhaul of how national income is distributed, so that it benefits households at the expense of government and businesses. That could be achieved by changing how companies and households are taxed and how government spends the money, raising retirement, health and unemployment benefits and removing an internal passport system responsible for huge rural-urban inequalities, among other reforms.So far, however, authorities have focused on upgrading the export-reliant manufacturing sector instead, with remarkable success in electric vehicles, solar energy and batteries.But this also prompted tariffs in the United States, Europe, Turkey and elsewhere.China may be able to boost external sales in areas where its economy is extremely competitive, but has little control on external demand.Deflationary pressuresThe property crisis, the debt overhang and weak consumption have all fuelled deflationary pressures.China’s policy of redirecting resources from the property market to the manufacturing sector, rather than consumers, has fuelled what Western governments describe as industrial overcapacity. This has led to factory gate deflation. Producer price inflation was 4.6% in July 2018 when Trump’s first tariffs came into effect. In September 2024 this stood at minus 2.8%. Consumer price inflation has ground to a paltry 0.4% from 2.1% over that period.Deflation, which hurts consumption, businesses and growth, could get much worse if tariffs shrink external demand, exacerbating industrial overcapacity.Limited room for currency depreciationThe yuan ended 2019 roughly 10% weaker against the dollar than in early 2018, when Washington flagged the tariffs plan and 4% weaker in trade-weighted terms against all currencies. The US curbs increased the effective tariff rate on all Chinese exports by 2.4 percentage points, according to Capital Economics analysts, which means that the yuan’s depreciation more than offset the tariff impact. This time, the yuan might have to fall 18% against the dollar to fully offset 60% US tariffs, implying a rate of 8.5 per dollar, the analysts calculated - levels unseen since the 1990s Asian financial crisis.Worried about capital outflows, authorities tried to prevent the yuan from weakening past 7.3 earlier this year. A full adjustment looks unlikely.Other factorsDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Washington unleashed trillions of dollars in stimulus, including cash handouts to consumers, some of which was spent on goods made in China.Also, after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Moscow got shut out of many Western markets, pushing it to source more goods from China.These were unexpected opportunities for Beijing, and are unlikely to be repeated. \nGermany’s ruling coalition collapsed on Wednesday as Chancellor Olaf Scholz sacked his finance minister and paved the way for a snap election, triggering political chaos in Europe’s largest economy hours after Donald Trump won the US presidential election.After sacking Finance Minister Christian Lindner of the Free Democrats (FDP) party, Scholz is expected to head a minority government with his Social Democrats and the Greens, the second-largest party.He would have to rely on cobbled-together parliamentary majorities to pass legislation and he plans to hold a parliamentary confidence vote in his government on Jan. 15, which could trigger snap elections by the end of March.Scholz said he would ask Friedrich Merz, leader of the opposition conservatives who are far ahead in polls, for support in passing the budget and boosting military spending. Merz is due to respond in a Thursday morning news conference.The collapse of Scholz’s three-way alliance caps months of wrangling over budget policy and Germany’s economic direction, with the government’s popularity sinking and far-right and far-left forces surging.“We need a government that is able to act, that has the strength to make the necessary decisions for our country,” Scholz told reporters.Scholz said he fired Lindner for his obstructive behaviour on budget disputes, accusing the minister of putting party before country and blocking legislation on spurious grounds.The move comes a day after the election of Republican Donald Trump as US president, with Europe scrambling to form a united response on issues from possible new US tariffs to Russia’s war in Ukraine and the future of the NATO alliance.The government crisis comes at a critical juncture for Germany, with a flatlining economy, aging infrastructure and an unprepared military.A political shake-up could fuel growing frustration with Germany’s mainstream parties to the benefit of younger populist movements, including the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD).With France also facing political uncertainty after snap elections this year, turmoil in the European Union’s two largest economies could hamper efforts to deepen the bloc’s integration at a time when it is facing challenges from east and west.DEBT BRAKE SUSPENSION DEMANDThe coalition has been at odds over how best to rescue Europe’s largest economy, which is facing its second year of contraction and a crisis in its economic model after the end of cheap gas from Russia following its 2022 invasion of Ukraine and amid increasing competition from China.Scholz said he had proposed capping energy costs for companies to bolster Germany’s appeal as a place to do business. He wanted a package to help save jobs in the ailing auto industry, as well as increased support for Ukraine.The FDP had proposed public spending cuts, lower taxes and less regulation as the answer to the malaise. It also wants to slow Germany’s shift to a carbon-neutral economy.Speaking after Scholz, Lindner said the chancellor had tried to strong-arm him into breaking a constitutionally-enshrined spending limit known as the debt brake, a move that Lindner, a fiscal hawk, refused to support.Government sources said Scholz had wanted to increase a Ukraine support package by 3 billion euros ($3.22 billion) to 15 billion euros and to finance it by suspending the debt brake.“Olaf Scholz refuses to recognise that our country needs a new economic model,” Lindner told reporters. “Olaf Scholz has showed he doesn’t have the strength to give his country a new boost.”The SPD and the Greens, while at odds on some issues, agree that targeted government spending is needed.The three other FDP ministers - for transport, justice, and education - all voluntarily left the government.Scholz said Lindner was focused on the short-term survival of his own party. “Especially today, one day after such an important event as the US elections, this kind of selfishness is utterly incomprehensible.”Economy Minister Robert Habeck of the Greens said the coalition could not agree on how to plug a funding gap in the budget for next year.“I want to say on our behalf that tonight feels wrong and doesn’t feel right. It’s almost tragic on a day like today, when Germany needs to show unity and capacity for action in Europe.” \n Donald Trump reshaped the US electorate once again this year, piling up support among Hispanic voters, young people, and Americans without college degrees — and winning more votes in nearly all of the country as he reclaimed the presidency.Following the Republican’s populist campaign, in which he promised to shield workers from global economic competition and offered a wide range of tax-cut proposals, Trump’s increasing strength among working-class voters and nonwhite Americans helped grow his share of the vote almost everywhere.The starkest increase may have been the 14-percentage-point swing in Trump’s share of Hispanic voters, according to an exit poll conducted by Edison Research. Some 46% of self-identified Hispanic voters picked Trump, up from 32% in the 2020 election when Trump lost to Democrat Joe Biden.Hispanics have largely favored Democrats for decades, but Trump’s share this year was the highest for a Republican presidential candidate in exit polls going back to the 1970s, and just higher than the 44% share won by Republican George W. Bush in 2004, according to data compiled by the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank.In counties where more than 20% of voting-age Americans were Hispanic, Trump’s margin over Democratic Vice President Kamala Harrisimproved by 13 points relative to his 2020 performance against Biden.“Young Hispanics do not have the same muscle memory as their grandparents who voted for Democrats for 50 years,” said Giancarlo Sopo, a Republican media strategist who worked on Hispanic outreach for Trump’s 2020 campaign.This time, Trump won 55% of Hispanic men, 19 points more than the 36% share he won four years earlier, while he garnered support from 38% of Hispanic women, up 8 points from 2020.Trump has made opposition to immigration a cornerstone of his political career, pledging to conduct mass deportations of people living in the US illegally. Many Hispanic voters supported Trump’s hardline positions, according to the Edison Research exit poll. About a quarter of Hispanic respondents said most immigrants in the country without documentation should be deported to the countries they came from, compared with 40% of voters overall in the poll.ECONOMIC CONCERNSHispanic Americans skew more working-class than the country’s white majority, with larger shares of Hispanics lacking college degrees, according to US Census Bureau estimates.Hispanics also tend to be younger than average in America, which means many have had less time to build wealth and have also been more exposed to the economic troubles of recent years, including high inflation and soaring interest rates for mortgages. Trump won 43% of voters age 18 to 29 - 7 points more than in 2020.About two-thirds of voters considered the US economy in poor shape, compared with about half of 2020 voters. Some 46% said their family’s financial situation was worse than four years ago, compared with 20% who said the same in 2020.“Republicans have consistently beat Democrats on connecting with voters on the economy,” said Clarissa Martinez De Castro, vice president of the nonpartisan UnidosUS Latino Vote Initiative. “This was a referendum on the economy, and that has consistently been the number one, two and three issues for Hispanic voters.”In the battleground state of Arizona, a state Biden won in 2020, Mexican-born Arturo Laguna became an American citizen earlier this year and cast his first US presidential ballot for Trump, citing the Republican’s conservatism and his embrace of restrictions on abortion access.“The three biggest things of importance are family values, being pro-life and religion,” said Laguna, a 28-year-old corporate manager. “I don’t feel like Kamala represents those values.”Across the country, in places where almost all votes were counted - roughly 2,200 counties nationwide - Trump’s margin was 5 points higher than it was in 2020.This broad increase - a rise of the Republican tide - in part owed to Trump’s gains among voters without college degrees, a massive class of voters that spans racial and ethnic categories and made up just over half of the electorate on Tuesday.Some 56% of voters without degrees picked Trump, up 6 points from the Republican’s share in the 2020 exit poll. Harris won 55% of voters who have degrees, unchanged from Biden’s share in 2020, when affluent suburbs helped power the Democrat’s victory.Trump’s gains build on major shifts in the electorate since his triumph in the 2016 presidential election, when he outperformed past Republicans by far among working-class white voters. He largely maintained his dominance with the group this year, winning 66% of their vote, with his share down 1 point from 2020, according to the Edison Research exit poll.Among people without college degrees and who are not white, however, Trump’s share of the vote increased by 8 points.While Trump gained ground in vote tallies across most of the country, some of his biggest advances were in and around big cities, areas that have been critical for past Democratic victories.Trump flipped Nassau County - just east of New York City on Long Island - winning about 52 percent of the vote there.And in the 25 big urban counties where nearly all the votes had been tallied by Wednesday morning, Harris won 60 percent of the vote, down about 5 percentage points from Biden’s performance in 2020 and the lowest share for a Democrat in those counties since at least 2012.Harris won 53% of the women’s vote, while Trump won 55% of the vote by men, with Trump performing slightly better with both groups compared with 2020. \nThe Meteorological Forecasting Division has predicted partly cloudy skies in the hilly regions of Nepal on Thursday, with fair to partly cloudy weather across the rest of the country.Light rain, accompanied by thunder and lightning, is likely at one or two locations in the hilly areas of Koshi, Gandaki, and Sudurpaschim provinces.For tonight, the hilly areas are expected to remain partly cloudy, while the rest of the country will experience mainly fair conditions. The division cited the influence of western and local winds on the current weather patterns.On Wednesday, Janakpur recorded the highest temperature at 36.2°C, while Jomsom saw the lowest at 3.5°C. The most rainfall was observed in Jiri, with 3.2 mm in the past 24 hours. \nSunil Babu Pant has played many roles. As the first openly gay parliament member, he helped inshrine LGBTQ rights in the Nepali constitution. He was also a monk, has a tourism agency, and made a documentary ‘Ajima and Six Gender Identities.’In this conversation with the Post’s Xenia Klaus, Pant shares his thoughts on storytelling and literature's role in his activism and filmmaking.You are a politician, an LGBTQ activist, a tourist guide and, since recently, a filmmaker. Is there one book that has influenced you through all of it?It wasn’t just one book; a vast body of literature impacted me. I started reading philosophical and religious books seriously as a young teenager, and they affected me deeply. Through this reading, I discovered Mahayana Buddhism. Unlike Theravada Buddhism, which often centres on suffering, Mahayana encourages you to engage with the world. Life isn’t only about your enlightenment or meditation—it’s about much more. This idea inspired me, and I became a committed practitioner.Is there one book that stands out among this vast body of literature?One book that had particular significance for me was ‘Bodhicharyavatara’ by Shantideva. In it, he discusses cultivating a selfless, compassionate mind that opens itself up to others. The book provides many examples of living a life of compassion—like the story of sacrificing one’s feet to feed a starving tiger.You later became a monk, but how has all this reading influenced your other work, for example, as an LGBTQ activist?Buddhism and Hinduism have shaped my worldview and, by extension, all of my work. Along the way, I found more specific influences as well. As I studied these texts, I began to see connections between them. One Hindu figure who has deeply inspired me is the goddess Kali. I admire her so much—she wears her hair loose and even steps on Shiva. Seeing her made me realise how different she is from the expectations society still often has for women; she is beyond imposed morality, fully free. Yet, she is still worshipped. This was a revolutionary idea for me and has inspired my journey toward self-liberation and freedom.Theology and philosophy are intense reading for a teen. How did you initially get into reading those books?I was fortunate to have an educated father who was a teacher and a wonderful storyteller. He loved Bollywood movies, theology, and epic Hindu dramas. Whenever he returned from Kathmandu, he’d bring colourful movie magazines. My love for reading began with him, and soon I was hooked. Nowadays, it's harder to find time to sit down and read a book, but back in the village, reading was the only way to nourish my mind and soul.Is there other literature besides philosophical and religious texts that have influenced your work?I also read extensively about history, including the LGBTQ movements in Europe and America, the Dalit movement, and the histories of Hinduism and Buddhism. Learning about our country’s history has been helpful for my political work; it gives me insight into the roots of our present struggles and how they are interconnected.It seems that philosophical books provided a constant foundation for your worldview, which you then expanded upon with insights from the specific topics you focused on.That sounds about right. Do you read fiction?After getting into philosophical books, I also started reading romances and science fiction. But the romances, in particular, often disturbed me; the gender roles and society’s judgments on love created anxiety and left me feeling distanced. Besides, fiction rarely sticks with me like other genres do. It doesn’t nourish me like philosophical books do. For me, fiction is more a form of entertainment than something fulfilling.I would argue that science fiction, for example, can be intellectually stimulating, as it encourages one to imagine different possible futures.That is true, but sometimes, it is too much for me. It makes me lose my inner balance. One fiction book I really like, though, is ‘Siddharta’ by Hermann Hesse.Are you into poetry?Oh, I love poetry. It feeds the heart and soul. You recently made a documentary, ‘Ajima and the Six Gender Identities’. Did you implement the lessons about storytelling you learned from all your reading?The most valuable storytelling lessons came from my father and family, not from books. As the youngest child, I remember gathering around before or after dinner, and my father would tell stories. My family encouraged me to tell stories, too, and everyone would clap. That positive feedback made me love storytelling from an early age.What does one need to be a good storyteller? To be a good storyteller, you must first be a great listener, listening to all the stories around you. It’s also essential to understand that humans have five senses, but most storytelling doesn’t engage all of them. When telling stories orally, you rely only on your voice. So, your voice must work extra hard to convey the experiences of touch, smell, sight, and taste—it has to bring all those senses to life.Sunil Babu Pant’s book recommendationsBodhicharyavatara Author: ShantidevaPublisher: VariousYear: Circa 700 ADThis is a great option for those who don’t have the time to read vast literature but still wish to grasp the core teachings of Mahayana Buddhism.The Words of My Perfect Teacher Author: Patrul RinpochePublisher: VariousYear: 19th centuryWise individuals can sometimes become arrogant.

Sunisa Bongkodphongampai also picked a wicket.In reply, Nepal bowled Thailand out for 35 inside 11.4 overs on the back of a four-wicket haul from Rachanna Chaudhary.Chaudhary returned the match figures of 4-10 in her magical three-over spell, including three scalps in the ninth over (8.1, 8.2 and 8.5 overs) that also included the wicket of Thailand’s top scorer Aphisara Suwanchonrathi (13).Riya Sharma also shone with the ball, taking two wickets in her four deliveries, while Puja Mahato grabbed two Thailand wickets giving away just three runs in her economical three overs.Except for opener Aphisara, no Thailand batters were able to reach the double digit figures.Hosts UAE, Nepal, Kuwait, and Thailand are competing in the Asia Qualifiers, with the top team at the end of the double round robin league earning their spot in the ICC U-19 Women’s T20 World Cup 2025, which is set to be held in Malaysia.India won the inaugural edition by defeating England by seven wickets in the final in Potchefstroom, South Africa in January last year.The UAE also began their campaign with a 106-run victory over Kuwait, courtesy of unbeaten half-centuries from Lavanya Keny (77 not out) and Samaira Dharnidharka (58 not out), and brilliant bowlings from Mehak Thakur (2-2), Al Maseera Jahangir (2-3) and Lavanya Keny (2-5).The hosts posted 143-1 from the allotted 20 overs before limiting the Kuwaitis to 37-10 in 15.2 overs.Nepal next play Kuwait on Thursday, while the UAE take on Thailand.The winners of the Asia Qualifier will join the other four teams who have already secured their tickets to the World Cup through regional qualifiers. Nigeria qualified from Africa, Samoa from East Asia Pacific and Scotland from Europe. The United States automatically qualified from the Americas region—and for a second time in a row—as they were the only team in the region to meet the criteria required to enter the qualification pathway.The 10 full-members teams from the 2023 U-19 Women’s T20 World Cup—Australia, Bangladesh, England, India, Ireland, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa, Sri Lanka and West Indies—have already received direct entry.Malaysia qualified as hosts.U-19 Women’s T20 World CUp Asia QualifierThe Sevens Stadium, AjmanTOSS: Thailand, bowl first.Nepal 102-6 (20/20 overs)Puja Mahato 35 (40), Seem KC 19*(19); Charukan Saema 4-0-20-2Thailand 35-10 (11.4/20 overs)Aphisara Suwanchonrathi 13 (23), Nattharika Thokoi 6(7); Rachanna Chaudhary 3-0-10-4, Riya Sharma 0.4-0-0-2, Puja Mahato 3-1-3-2Nepal win by 67 runs.Nepal’s next fixturesNov 7Nepal vs KuwaitNov 9Nepal vs UAENov 10Nepal vs ThailandNov 12Nepal vs KuwaitNov 13Nepal vs UAE \nDonald Trump was elected president, capping a remarkable comeback four years after he was voted out of the White House and ushering in a new American leadership likely to test democratic institutions at home and relations abroad.Trump, 78, recaptured the White House on Wednesday by securing more than the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the presidency, Edison Research projected, following a campaign of dark rhetoric that deepened the polarization in the country.The former president’s victory in the swing state of Wisconsin pushed him over the threshold.“America has given us an unprecedented and powerful mandate,” Trump said early on Wednesday to a roaring crowd of supporters at the Palm Beach County Convention Center in Florida.Trump’s political career had appeared to be over after his false claims of election fraud led a mob of supporters to storm the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, in a failed bid to overturn his 2020 defeat.But he swept away challengers inside his Republican Party and then beat Democratic candidate Kamala Harris by capitalizing on voter concerns about high prices and what Trump claimed, without evidence, was a rise in crime due to illegal immigration.Harris did not speak to supporters who had gathered at her alma mater Howard University. Her campaign co-chair, Cedric Richmond, briefly addressed the crowd after midnight, saying Harris would speak publicly later on Wednesday.“We still have votes to count,” he said.Republicans won a US Senate majority, but neither party appeared to have an edge in the fight for control of the House of Representatives where Republicans currently hold a narrow majority.Jobs and EconomyVoters identified jobs and the economy as the country’s most pressing problem, according to Reuters/Ipsos opinion polls. Many Americans remained frustrated by higher prices even amid record-high stock markets, fast-growing wages and low unemployment. With the administration of President Joe Biden taking much of the blame, a majority of voters said they trusted Trump more than Harris to address the issue.Hispanics, traditionally Democratic voters, and lower-income households hit hardest by inflation helped fuel Trump's election victory. His loyal base of rural, white and non-college educated voters again showed up in force.Trump prevailed despite persistently low approval ratings. Impeached twice, he has been criminally indicted four times and found civilly liable for sexual abuse and defamation. In May, Trump was convicted by a New York jury of falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments to a porn star.His victory will have major implications for US trade and climate change policies, the war in Ukraine, Americans’ taxes and immigration.His tariff proposals could spark a fiercer trade war with China and US allies, while his pledges to reduce corporate taxes and implement a spate of new cuts could balloon US debt, economists say.Trump has promised to launch a mass deportation campaign targeting immigrants in the country illegally.He has said he wants the authority to fire civil servants he views as disloyal. His opponents fear he will turn the Justice Department and other federal law enforcement agencies into political weapons to investigate perceived enemies.A second Trump presidency could drive a bigger wedge between Democrats and Republicans on issues such as race, gender, what and how children are taught, and reproductive rights.Harris Falls ShortVice President Harris fell short in her 15-week sprint as a candidate, failing to galvanise enough support to defeat Trump, who occupied the White House from 2017-2021, or to allay voters' concerns about the economy and immigration.Harris had warned that Trump wanted unchecked presidential power and posed a danger to democracy.Nearly three-quarters of voters say American democracy is under threat, according to Edison Research exit polls, underscoring the polarization in a nation where divisions have only grown starker during a fiercely competitive race.Trump ran a campaign characterized by apocalyptic language. He called the United States a “garbage can” for immigrants, pledged to save the economy from “obliteration” and cast some rivals as the “enemy within.”His diatribes were often aimed at migrants, who he said were “poisoning the blood of the country,” or Harris, whom he frequently derided as unintelligent.Despite legal woes and controversies, Trump is only the second former president to win a second term after leaving the White House. The first was Grover Cleveland, who served two four-year terms starting in 1885 and 1893.Unprecedented CampaignIn May, Trump was convicted by a New York jury of falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments to a porn star. Two months later, a would-be assassin’s bullet grazed his right ear during a campaign rally, exacerbating fears about political violence. Another assassination attempt was thwarted in September at his Florida golf course. Trump blamed both attempts on what he claimed was the heated rhetoric of Democrats including Harris.Barely eight days after the July shooting, Biden, 81, dropped out of the race, finally bowing to weeks of pressure from his fellow Democrats after a poor performance during his debate with Trump called into question his mental acuity and the viability of his reelection bid.Biden’s decision to step aside turned the contest into a sprint, as Harris raced to mount her own campaign in a matter of weeks, rather than the typical months. Her rise to the top of the ticket reenergized despondent Democrats, and she raised more than $1 billion in less than three months while erasing what had been a solid Trump lead in opinion polls.Harris' financial advantage was partly countered by the intervention of the world's richest man, Elon Musk, who poured more than $100 million into a super PAC mobilizing Trump voters and used his social media site X to amplify pro-Trump messaging.As the campaign drew to a close, Harris increasingly focused on warning Americans about the perils of reelecting Trump and offered an olive branch to disaffected Republicans.She highlighted remarks from several former Trump officials, including his former chief of staff and retired Marine Corps General John Kelly, who described Trump as a “fascist.”Trump’s victory will broaden the fissures in American society, given his false claims of election fraud, anti-immigrant rhetoric and demonization of his political opponents, said Alan Abramowitz, a political science professor at Emory University who studies voter behaviour and party politics.A Trump Second TermTrump has vowed to reshape the executive branch, including firing civil servants he views as disloyal and using federal law enforcement agencies to investigate his political enemies, violating what has been a longstanding policy of keeping such agencies independent.During his first term, Trump’s most extreme demands were sometimes stymied by his own cabinet members, most notably when Vice President Mike Pence refused to block Congress from accepting the 2020 election results.Once the 2024 vote is certified by Congress on January 6, Trump and his vice president, US Senator JD Vance, are due to take office on Inauguration Day, January 20. Throughout his two-year-long campaign, Trump has signalled he will prioritize personal fealty in staffing his administration. He promised roles in his administration to Musk and former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., both avid supporters. \nRepublican Donald Trump claimed victory in the 2024 presidential contest after Fox News projected that he had defeated Democrat Kamala Harris, which would cap a stunning political comeback four years after he left the White House.“America has given us an unprecedented and powerful mandate,” he said early on Wednesday to a roaring crowd of supporters at the Palm Beach County Convention Center.Other news outlets had yet to call the race for Trump, but he appeared on the verge of winning after capturing the battleground states of Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Georgia and holding leads in the other four, according to Edison Research.Harris did not speak to her supporters, who had gathered at her alma mater Howard University. Her campaign co-chair, Cedric Richmond, briefly addressed the crowd after midnight, saying Harris would speak publicly on Wednesday.“We still have votes to count,” he said.The former president was showing strength across broad swaths of the country, improving on his 2020 performance everywhere from rural areas to urban centres.Republicans won a US Senate majority after flipping Democratic seats in West Virginia and Ohio. Neither party appeared to have an edge in the fight for control of the House of Representatives where Republicans currently hold a narrow majority.Trump went into Election Day with a 50-50 chance of reclaiming the White House, a remarkable turnaround from Jan. 6, 2021, when many pundits pronounced his political career to be over. That day, a mob of his supporters stormed Congress in a violent attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 election.Trump picked up more support from Hispanics, traditionally Democratic voters, and among lower-income households that have keenly felt the sting of price rises since the last presidential election in 2020, according to exit polls from Edison.Trump won 45% of Hispanic voters nationwide, trailing Harris with 53% but up 13 percentage points from 2020.About 31% of voters said the economy was their top issue, and they voted for Trump by a 79%-to-20% margin, according to exit polls. Some 45% of voters across the country said their family’s financial situation was worse off today than four years ago, and they favored Trump 80% to 17%.Global investors were increasingly pricing in a Trump win late on Tuesday. US stock futures and the dollar pushed higher, while Treasury yields climbed and bitcoin rose - all flagged by analysts and investors as trades that favor a Trump victory.At Howard University, where a large watch party was being held for Harris, supporters were leaving in droves, anticipating that the vice president would not address the crowd on Tuesday night.Cedric Richmond, a co-chair of the Harris campaign, briefly addressed the crowd and said Harris would not speak. “We still have votes to count,” he said. “We still have states that haven’t been called yet.”TRUMP OUTPERFORMS 2020Trump was earning a bigger share of the vote than he did four years ago in nearly every corner of the country.By 12:30 a.m. ET, officials had nearly completed their count of ballots in more than 1,600 counties – about half the country – and Trump’s share was up about 2 percentage points compared to 2020, reflecting a broad if not especially deep shift in Americans’ support for the president they ousted four years ago.He improved his numbers in suburban counties, rural regions and even some large cities that are historically bastions of Democratic support; in high-income counties and low-income ones; and in places where unemployment was comparatively high and in places where it is now at record lows.Harris had banked on big margins among urban and suburban voters, but her support in those places was running well behind President Joe Biden’s in the 2020 election.Nearly three-quarters of voters said American democracy is under threat, according to the exit polls, underscoring the depth of polarization in a nation where divisions have only grown starker during a fiercely competitive race.Trump employed increasingly apocalyptic rhetoric while stoking unfounded fears that the election system cannot be trusted. Harris warned that a second Trump term would threaten the underpinnings of American democracy.Hours before polls closed, Trump claimed on his Truth Social site without evidence that there was “a lot of talk about massive CHEATING” in Philadelphia, echoing his false claims in 2020 that fraud had occurred in large, Democratic-dominated cities. In a subsequent post, he also asserted there was fraud in Detroit.“I don’t respond to nonsense,” Detroit City Clerk Janice Winfrey told Reuters.A Philadelphia city commissioner, Seth Bluestein, replied on X, “There is absolutely no truth to this allegation.”DIZZYING CAMPAIGNTrump voted earlier near his home in Palm Beach, Florida.“If I lose an election, if it’s a fair election, I’m gonna be the first one to acknowledge it,” Trump told reporters.Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a prominent Trump backer, watched the results at Mar-a-Lago with Trump.Millions of Americans waited in orderly lines to cast ballots, with only sporadic disruptions reported across a handful of states, including several non-credible bomb threats that the FBI said appeared to originate from Russian email domains.Tuesday’s vote capped a dizzying race churned by unprecedented events, including two assassination attempts against Trump, Biden’s surprise withdrawal and Harris’ rapid rise.No matter who wins, history will be made.Harris, 60, the first female vice president, would become the first woman, Black woman and South Asian American to win the presidency. Trump, 78, the only president to be impeached twice and the first former president to be criminally convicted, would also become the first president to win non-consecutive terms in more than a century. \nThe Montreal Convention increases liability limits for death, injury, delays, baggage, and cargo issues for international air travel from December 28, 2024, protecting passenger rights and ensuring fair compensation.\nDuring Dashain, Nepali families gather, but both young and old are absorbed in their phones, resulting in diminished parent-child interaction, developmental delays, and increased vulnerability to cyber violence, particularly due to parental \"technoference.\"\nTorrential September rains in Nepal killed over 200, left thousands homeless, and caused extensive economic damage, with cleanup efforts still underway despite a lack of government assistance.\nFarmers in Nepal have increased their income significantly by growing round chillies, reducing crop loss due to animal damage and securing a stable market, with plans for a 60 million Nepalese rupee profit this year.\nNepal's PM Oli expresses dissatisfaction towards India, alleges interference and plans to raise concerns at the UN while blaming India for undermining his authority.\n\n\nRae was the envoy to Kathmandu during the promulgation of the 2015 constitution and the subsequent blockade. In this conversation, Rae talks about the evolution of Nepal-India ties since the blockade, regional geopolitics, what the two countries get wrong about each other, how New Delhi views Nepali communist parties and the governments they lead, and the change (if any) in India’s neighbourhood policy since the start of Narendra Modi’s third term in office. \nKunwar has been the MD for just under three years. Before coming back to her homeland to join Daraz Nepal, she worked at different American companies, including Amazon, the world’s biggest e-commerce platform.

The appointment followed the recommendation of the Council of Ministers and approval from the Parliamentary Hearing Committee, with the official announcement made on Wednesday.According to Archana Khadka, the information officer at the President’s Office, the President appointed Pandit as ambassador in accordance with Article 282 (1) of the Constitution. . Pandit will now assume the role of Nepal’s resident Ambassador to Israel.Parliamentary hearing committee endorsed Pandit as Nepal’s envoy to Israel two months ago.During his parliamentary hearing, Pandit expressed his intent to work towards peace in the ongoing Israel-Palestine conflict once he takes up his post. “Palestine also deserves to live,” he said, highlighting his commitment to advocating for peace in the region. \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli is known for his supposed ability to implement decisions and accomplish the tasks he takes up even at the cost of becoming unpopular.But a series of events after he became prime minister in mid-July tells a different story.In the three and half months since he assumed office at Singha Durbar, the prime minister has been compelled to backtrack on a couple of his plans or postpone them.In the first week of September, Prime Minister Oli pushed a plan to remove Deputy Speaker Indira Rana Magar from the post and elect a lawmaker from the ruling Nepali Congress in her place. According to multiple leaders privy to the development, by electing a Congress lawmaker as deputy speaker, Oli wanted to strengthen relations with the major coalition partner Congress, which has more seats than the prime minister’s party, the CPN-UML, in the House of Representatives. Congress chief Sher Bahadur Deuba has a special interest in getting a lawmaker from his party elected to the post, as deputy speaker is an ex-officio member of the Constitutional Council, which nominates members and heads of constitutional bodies.The prime minister on September 9 convened a meeting of the ruling parties and floated a proposal to remove Deputy Speaker Magar and sought a green signal from the coalition partners to his plan.After the meeting, party leaders told the Post that Prime Minister Oli proposed removing Deputy Speaker Magar from her position, citing conduct unbecoming of her office. Deputy Speaker Magar courted controversy after it emerged that she had requested visa interview dates from the US Embassy for individuals unrelated to her official role. On February 26 last year, Magar wrote to the US Embassy in Kathmandu requesting a visa interview for herself and five others. Two months later, the letter was leaked, and she was under pressure to step down.Last month, the prime minister held several meetings and consultations with a plan to introduce an ordinance to amend the Political Parties Act-2017 with an intention to facilitate party splits. This plan also drew widespread criticism as leaders from various political parties and independent observers accused the prime minister of plotting splits of fringe political parties with a plan to merge their dissident groups into the UML.His proposal to introduce ordinance was reportedly floated in order to merge the Ashok-Rai led Janata Socialist Party and the dissident group from the Madhav Nepal-led CPN (Unified Socialist), which in turn would make the UML the largest party in the House of Representatives.As the major coalition partner, the Congress, reportedly did not back his proposal to introduce the ordinance, Oli was again pushed to the back seat.These are just a few cases in point. Oli from the start of this tenure has struggled to assert his authority.Professor of political science Krishna Pokharel assesses that there may have been an understanding between Congress President Deuba and Prime Minister Oli to arrest Rastriya Swatantra Party President Rabi Lamichhane, who was accused of misappropriating cooperative funds, and issuing an ordinance related to political parties.Pokharel believes that the two leaders might have reached a deal to accomplish the two goals—bring an ordinance to facilitate the split of the CPN (Unified Socialist), which was formed in 2021 after breaking away from the UML; and arrest Lamichhane. Lamichhane, the immediate past home minister, had reportedly tried to arrest Congress chief Deuba’s spouse (current foreign minister) Arzu Rana Deuba, on charges of involvement in the Bhutanese refugee scam. “While the wish of the Congress chief was fulfilled, the interest of the UML chair and the prime minister was not,” Pokharel said. However, the UML leaders don’t buy this argument. Vice-chair Yubaraj Gyawali said that the government under UML leadership has just completed its 100 days, so it is too early to judge its performance. “There are many good initiatives taken by this government whose results will come in due course,” Gyawali told the Post. “Everything that the head of the government wants cannot be achieved in such a short period, but that does not mean his influence has waned.” But some political analysts say that Oli’s standing has declined since he became prime minister this time with the support of Congress, the largest party in Parliament. Oli dismisses those who claim his influence has gone down. While addressing the symposium on ‘Role of former security personnel in National Security and Development’ organised by the Nepal National Former Army and Police Association on October 27, Oli rubbished claims that his influence was steadily decreasing.“Those who claim my charm has decreased will know the reality in the 2027 election,” Oli said.Sarita Bhusal, a UML lawmaker, said a mistaken impression might have been created among the people. “Sometimes there are constraints to leading a coalition government,” Bhusal told the Post.Gyawali, a vice chair of the UML, agrees. “Earlier, Oli became prime minister with the support of smaller parties. But this time, he has the backing of the largest party in Parliament, so it is not easy for him to do all that he wants.” Oli first headed a coalition government after the promulgation of the constitution in 2015. When he became prime minister again in 2018 after the 2017 election, his party was the largest in the House. He became prime minister with the support of the Maoist Centre, which was his coalition partner during his previous stint as well.The Congress publicity department head, Min Bahadur Bishwakarma, said his party has been giving full support to the Oli government. “Our party has not opposed any government programme that is good for the country,” Bishwakarma told the Post. “We only caution the government on issues that may cause public backlash.”This government was formed in the spirit of a seven-point agreement between the two parties, and achieving those objectives must be its primary focus, Bishawakarma said. Of late, Oli has also faced criticism from within his party. Some UML leaders publicly opposed his recent decision to accept a donation from Min Bahadur Gurung, owner of Bhatbhateni Supermarket, for the construction of the party’s head office. Experts see it as a sign of his decreasing hold in the party organisation. Although party’s standing committee member Binda Pandey and central committee member Ushakiran Timilsina protested against it publicly, other party leaders are also reportedly dissatisfied with Oli’s decision.Bhim Rawal, who contested the election for chair against Oli during the party’s 10th general convention in Chitwan in November 2021, also criticised Oli for accepting the donation. Sidelined by Oli, Rawal is currently inactive in the party. Even leaders like Gokul Baskota, who used to be a staunch Oli supporter, couldn’t back him on the deal with businessman Gurung.In an interview with Image television, Baskota said, “The UML cannot accept Gurung’s donation and carry his old baggage.” On October 28, the Supreme Court issued an interlocutory interim order barring the ruling party, UML, from building any structure on the land donated by businessman Gurung. A single bench of Justice Sunil Kumar Pokharel said the UML-Gurung donation deal was illegal prima facie, putting Oli further on the defensive. \nAfter being ousted from government leadership on July 12, the CPN (Maoist Centre), the third largest party in the House of Representatives, finds itself in uncharted territory, facing a long spell out of power for the for the first time in nine years since the promulgation of the constitution in 2015. In a show of dissent, the party organised a protest rally in Kathmandu on October 26.As the main opposition party in the House, the Maoist Centre marked the new government’s 100th day with the protest rally, but its leaders say they have no specific programmes planned until the by-elections for the local level.The Election Commission is set to hold the by-elections for vacant seats in 39 local units on December 1. “Before the local-level by-election, our party may not organise any major event,\" Yubaraj Chaulagain, a Bagmati Province lawmaker and politburo member of the party, told the Post. “Now our focus will be on the by-elections.” Chaulagain also said that the party will convene a central committee meeting soon after the by-election to chart out the party's strategy ahead. Lekhanath Dahal, a federal lawmaker from the party, echoes Chaulagain, stating that while the party does not have any event, they were encouraged by public participation in their protest rally. He further adds that public interest in the Maoist Centre was evident from the turnout at the rally.“With the support of the people, we will come up with protest programmes against the steps taken by the current KP Sharma Oli-led government, which appears to be encouraging corruption and inefficient governance,” Dahal told the Post.Although Maoist Centre leaders assert that more people support their party because of their effective performance in the immediate past government, political analysts refuse to buy such claims. Like most other political parties, the Maoist Centre has also struggled with a lack of political agenda, which has caused a void in party activity, political analysts claim. “It is one thing to claim that the government under your leadership was better and more effective than others, but to claim that the Maoist Centre’s performance attracting the masses is farcical,” professor of political science Krishna Pokharel told the Post. In Pokhrel's opinion, the lack of a pro-people agenda has caused parties to drift away from the public. A clear example of this is their failure to come up with an effective programme for a long time, he said.Maoist Centre can provide a tough competition in the upcoming general elections if the party establishes itself as a strong opposition in Parliament, Pokharel adds.But the leaders of the Maoist center claim that it is wrong to say that they lack a pro-people programme and agenda. They say that they are working to reunite with the factions that split from the original Maoist party, to attract more public support.Since losing power, the Maoist center has made many efforts to strengthen itself, including reviving the Socialist Front. The party, which later forgot the Socialist Front that it created while in power, organised a meeting in July, right after losing power, and announced plans to reactivate it.However, with other parties affiliated to the Socialist Front focussed on their own internal issues, the front’s activities have stalled. The Front is an alliance of smaller, like-minded political parties with a socialist orientation.However, Lekhanath Dahal, the Maoist Centre leader, claims that the Socialist Front will hold a meeting soon. The Front’s meeting in July had formed a three-member task force to strengthen the front, and based on their recommendations, a full meeting will be scheduled soon. \nAs the government completes 100 days in office, some leaders from its major coalition partner, the Nepali Congress, have started to comment on the government’s performance—often unfavourably.Remarks by some key Congress leaders, particularly by senior Congress leader Shekhar Koirala, have alarmed a section of the governing parties. Congress is the largest party in the government led by KP Sharma Oli of the CPN-UML.Koirala, who contested for the post of party president and got defeated by Sher Bahadur Deuba three years ago, leads the anti-establishment faction in the party.Koirala has been raising critical questions against the government’s wrongdoings, causing apprehension among those in government. At times, he has even taken a stance against the government’s moves.For instance, Prime Minister Oli and Energy Minister Dipak Khadka are at loggerheads with Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) Managing Director Kul Man Ghising over whether or not to disrupt power supply to the companies defaulting in paying the NEA’s bills.In this prolonged dispute, Koirala has supported Ghising, who is backed by the main opposition, the CPN (Maoist Centre).Koirala was once a proponent of the Congress-UML coalition when Maoist Centre ditched the Congress to join hands with UML. He also played a role in forging an alliance with the UML to form a provincial government led by a Congress lawmaker in Koshi.Observers say that his latest stances are part of his strategy to present himself as a strong candidate for the party president in the next general convention, which should be held by the end of 2025 in accordance with the party statute.“It is possible that he is trying to establish himself as the main contender of the party leadership for the next convention, making the party rank and file believe that no other leaders can give alternatives to the party other than him,” Rajesh Gautam, a historian who has written multiple books on Congress, told the Post.As party president Sher Bahadur Deuba has already announced not to contest for the top post in the general convention, second-rung Congress leaders have already started making assumptions about the next leadership.Koirala, who lost to Deuba by a small margin for the party’s top post in 2021, is considered an untested leader because he hasn’t taken any key position in the party and has not even become a minister so far.Party leaders close to Koirala say that he was making comments based on the merit of the government’s performance.They say that by making such comments, Koirala has been trying to bring the government on the right track when it fumbles. Sometimes, he might seem harsh towards the government, but that is aimed at correcting the coalition and not toppling it, they argue.“Before Congress-UML came together to form the government, Koirala was one of the leaders who had advocated for the coalition of the two biggest parties,” Govindaraj Pokharel, a Congress leader close to Koirala, told the Post. “Therefore, as the proponent of the present coalition, he might have thought it was his moral duty to question the government if it cannot live up to its promise.”But Gautam differs.The performance of the government is below par and even the layman can find faults in its functioning, Gautam says.The Congress-UML government was formed in July based on a seven-point agreement, and its basic duty is to work to fulfill it. When the government deviates from its promised objectives to other issues, Pokharel says, Koirala sometimes becomes critical of the government to remind it of its objectives.In the recent party programme held on October 10, Koirala mentioned the three areas where the government had unnecessarily poked its nose: by not allowing the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) chief Kul Man Ghising to work as per his plan, by trying to unseat the Deputy Speaker Indira Magar Rana, and by planning to issue an ordinance related to Political Parties.Pokharel argues that Koirala has supported the government’s right move. When the government decided to constitute a high-level commission to recommend reforms to revitalise the ailing economy under the leadership of former finance secretary Rameshwar Khanal, Koirala welcomed it, Pokharel says.Apart from that, he adds, Koirala never criticised the government when it decided to take the tasks of the peace process ahead, pay the due amounts of sugarcane farmers, or form a committee to revitalise the country's tourism sector. However, the wrong act of the government should be questioned, and even though he is a leader from the coalition partner and he is not mincing words, Pokharel says.Jeevan Pariyar, a Congress joint general secretary, also says that Koirala's opinion on holding the government accountable should not be misinterpreted.“However, the government is still to fulfill its promises,” Pariyar told the Post.Two days ago, the government decided to provide free cancer treatment for children below 14 years of age at government hospitals. Pariyar describes it as a latest example of the positive initiatives taken by the government.Minister for Health and Population Pradip Paudel decided on Sunday to provide free cancer treatment for children below 14 years of age at Kanti Children’s Hospital, Bhaktapur Cancer Hospital and BP Koirala Memorial Cancer Hospital Bharatpur.There is no point in getting disappointed by the government since it has only completed 100 days, Pariyar says.However, some Congress leaders think the government is not working as per their expectation.In Monday’s meeting of the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee under the House of Representatives, Congress lawmaker Hirdayaram Thani raised several questions to Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak, a Congress leader, about the home ministry’s performance.“Where has the investigation on the irregularities on Giri Bandhu tea estate reached?” Thani questioned Home Minister Lekhak. The Giri Bandhu land scam is linked to Prime Minister Oli and Congress, which officially made its position clear through its parliamentary party meeting on May 14 and demanded an investigation into the decision-making process of the land swap permit. Thani also asked the home minister why investigations on various other corruption scams weren’t moving ahead satisfactorily.Pokharel, the Congress leader, says questioning the government does not mean the Congress leader does not favour this coalition government.“The duty of leaders who are representing the party in the government is to do better work,” Pokharel says. “It is also the duty of leaders out of the government to question it to make it accountable to the people.” \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City has designated 47 locations for floriculturists and flower vendors to sell flowers in Tihar.The city office’s move aims to avoid the inconvenience the floral vendors faced last year and reduce congestion on the sidewalks.“This year, we have designated 47 locations, most of them in shopping malls, marts, parks and party palaces,” said Dharma Raj Bhandari, a police inspector at the city office. “Farmers and vendors can take their products to those designated places and do business at their convenience. Our staff will help them reach the designated areas if they can not do so on their own.”Last year, many floral farmers from the adjoining districts of the Kathmandu Valley who brought flowers in the capital city could not sell their products due to restrictions the city office imposed in many places.The farmers were then allowed to sell flowers at Bhrikutimandap, Tinkune park, Handigaun and Balaju Valley Cold Store in coordination with the Floriculture Association of Nepal and the Nepal Chamber of Commerce. However, farmers and vendors discarded piles of flowers and garlands on footpaths and returned home, incurring heavy losses.The metropolis had deployed its staffers, including the metropolis police, to collect discarded flowers and garlands, which were dumped at the landfill site in Bancharedanda.Officials say that the malls, party palaces and parks will not charge farmers and vendors for providing space for selling flowers and garlands. KMC officials discussed the matter with the owners of the malls and party palaces and requested them to provide spaces for farmers to sell flowers and garlands in Tihar.“Floral farmers and vendors can sell flowers from other private places, but we will not allow them to obstruct footpaths,” said Laxmi Maharjan, a senior assistant sub-inspector of the KMC. “This year, we designated specified sales points in advance to avoid repeating last year’s situation.”The metropolis has also requested that people use flowers produced by Nepali farmers in Tihar and prohibit the sale, storage, distribution and use of plastic bouquets and flowers.“We have already confiscated plastic bouquets and flowers from many places,” said Maharjan. “We will fine traders if they ignore our warnings.”The metropolis has asked floral farmers and vendors to call the hotline 1180 or 015901763 and 9851356509 for help. \nTen people were injured in a bus accident at Ghumaune in Kharipati of Bhaktapur district on Tuesday. Two are reportedly in critical condition.According to Pradeep Khatri, a traffic police inspector and chief of the District Traffic Police Range, the bus coming from Talakot of Changunarayan Municipality lost its control and hit a pole. The injured are undergoing treatment at Bhaktapur Hospital, police said. \nTraffic police have reintroduced the no-horn campaign in Kathmandu Valley to combat unnecessary honking.Officers carrying placards with “no-horn” messages are stationed at various intersections, urging drivers to refrain from honking.Deputy Superintendent of Police Rabin Karki, spokesperson for the Kathmandu Valley Traffic Police Office, said the campaign aims to curb noise pollution through stricter enforcement and public awareness.Despite Kathmandu being declared a horn-free zone in April 2017, rampant horn use continues. Karki said the Vehicle and Transport Management Act prohibits honking in restricted areas, classifying it as a traffic violation.Last fiscal year, 10,123 vehicles were fined for unnecessary honking. This year, 13,003 vehicles have already faced penalties. The awareness drive was relaunched on October 17.Karki explained that while normal hearing can tolerate up to 60 decibels, 70 decibels is harmful. Noise pollution causes hearing loss, high blood pressure, heart disease, strokes, respiratory issues, and memory loss. Loud motorcycles and vehicles with modified silencers or pressure horns are major contributors. The police are focusing on violators, with particular attention to the impact on pedestrians, especially children, the elderly, pregnant women, and those with health issues, Karki said. \nAs the Kathmandu Valley’s air quality is set to deteriorate in the coming days, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City is gearing up to start vehicle emission testing.For this, the city office has purchased a smoke meter (a portable device for testing vehicle emissions), which will be used in coordination with other stakeholders—the Metropolitan Traffic Police Division, the Department of Transport Management, and the Department of Environment.“Vehicle emission testing is mainly the responsibility of the agencies under the federal government, but the constitution has also given local governments the authority to take measures to reduce pollution,” said Sarita Rai, chief of the Environment Department. “We also have developed pollution control guidelines as per the KMC Environment and Natural Resources Protection Act-2021.”Officials say vehicle emission testing will start once the pollution control guidelines are published in the metropolis gazette. In the first phase, emissions of petrol and diesel vehicles operating in the metropolis will be randomly tested, and the city office has also planned to carry out emission testing for motorcycles.Emission testing will be carried out on vehicles that have passed emission testing from the Department of Transport Management and received green stickers. Officials say that vehicles with green stickers could still emit black smoke for various reasons, including lack of timely servicing and maintenance.“We have seen many vehicles with green stickers emitting black smoke,” an official at the Environment Department of the KMC said, asking not to be named as the official is not authorised to talk to the media. “Many automobile owners only service their vehicles ahead of the annual pollution testing.” Officials say that the amount of the fine will be determined based on the suggestions of stakeholders.Vehicle emission testing is among the measures the city office has been taking to reduce pollution levels in the metropolis.The KMC has also started independently monitoring the city's air quality, with support from the Partnership for Healthy Cities, which has provided 19 portable devices to the city office.The Partnership for Healthy Cities is a global network of 74 cities, including the Kathmandu metropolis, committed to saving lives by preventing noncommunicable diseases and injuries. The programme is supported by Bloomberg Philanthropies in partnership with the World Health Organisation and Vital Strategies.Nepal’s air quality reaches hazardous levels several times a year during winter and summer, and the capital city often ranks as the world’s most polluted metropolis. Major hospitals also report a spike in respiratory problems due to the impact of toxic air and dust. Doctors warn that people get sick from respiratory illnesses caused by polluted air throughout the year, due to polluted air.Doctors say air pollution is known to cause various respiratory illnesses. Poor air quality can cause short- and long-term effects on public health. In the short term, it can lead to pneumonia, bronchitis, conjunctivitis, skin allergy, stroke, and heart problems, and in the long run it can lead to severe conditions like ulcers, and cancer of the lungs and intestine, kidney disease, and heart complications.People in low- and middle-income countries get disproportionately affected by the polluted air, which accounts for more than 90 percent of deaths, according to the World Health Organisation.Several studies carried out in the past in Nepal show that toxic air takes a huge toll on public health. Along with respiratory illness, the toxic air has led to severe conditions like ulcers, cancer of the lungs and intestine, kidney disease, heart complications, high blood pressure and stroke, according to experts.The report, titled “Global burden and strength of evidence for 88 risk factors in 204 countries and 811 subnational locations, 1990–2021: A systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2021,” finds that air pollution was the leading contributor to the global disease burden in 2021, making for eight percent of total disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), followed by high blood pressure (7.8 percent). The report was published in The Lancet, a leading international medical journal.Studies carried out in the past show that polluted air has been shortening people’s lives. Nepali lives are being cut short by around five years, according to a report by the Air Quality Life Index (AQLI), which converts air pollution concentration into an impact on life expectancy. AQLI is a metric produced by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago.Toxic air is deadlier than tobacco use and high blood pressure, which reduce life by 2.8 years and 1.7 years, respectively, according to the report.Environment experts in Nepal often point out that worsening air quality has not only affected people’s health but also hit the economy and hindered overall development of the country. \nTicket bookings for public transport during the Dashain festival will open this Saturday. Following discussions with stakeholders, the Department of Transport Management announced that tickets will be available online and at counters to manage the expected surge of nearly two million travellers leaving the Kathmandu Valley for the festivities.According to the department’s Director General, Rajiv Pokharel, transport operators will facilitate online bookings. “We have instructed operators to arrange online bookings wherever possible,” he said. “For counter bookings, passengers must obtain tickets only from official staff wearing uniforms and identification badges.”Around two million people are estimated to leave the Kathmandu Valley during Dashain. The department has introduced 20-point directives to ensure safe and hassle-free travel. Key measures include mandatory checks for alcohol consumption by drivers at major entry and exit points and the requirement for two drivers on long-distance routes. Additionally, those under 18 cannot work as assistant drivers.To assist travellers during Dashain, Tihar, and Chhath festivals, citizen help desks will be established at major locations such as Nagdhunga, Kalanki, Swayambhu, Halchowk, Machhapokhari, Gongabu Bus Park, Chabahil, Tilganga, Koteshwar, Jagati, Satdobato, Balkhu, Dakshinkali, Sundhara, and Sangha in Kavre. An inspection team comprising officials from various agencies will monitor travel arrangements with support from provincial transport ministries.Public transport operating on long and medium-distance routes must follow a designated queue system. Transport expert Ashish Gajurel noted that although bookings are open each year, passengers face difficulties. \"Bus operators don’t increase the number of buses during Dashain, despite rising demand. Authorities must increase the number of buses to ease travel,\" he said.Saroj Sitaula, senior vice-president of the Federation of Nepalese National Transport Entrepreneurs, however, argued that ‘unnecessary’ vehicle checks should be avoided to prevent inconvenience for passengers and drivers. He also highlighted the need to repair potholes on roads to ensure smooth travel.Earlier, Minister for Physical Infrastructure and Transport Devendra Dahal instructed the Department of Roads to complete road repairs nationwide before Ghatasthapana, the first day of the 15-day Dashain festival. The department reported that repairs are underway but have been delayed by the monsoon.The Narayanghat-Butwal road section, part of the East-West Highway, remains a major concern, with only 52.7 percent of its upgrade completed after six years of construction and multiple deadline extensions. The Meteorological Forecasting Division of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology has predicted chances of rainfall in various places of the country for a couple of days more, raising concerns about travel difficulties during Dashain. Other problematic sections include Nagdhunga-Mugling and Mugling-Pokhara, with landslides and potholes reported along various highways, including the Mid-Hill, Madan Bhandari, Hulaki, and BP highways. \nThe work on constructing a 24.5-metre-high dam for the 100MW Super Trishuli Hydropower Project on the Trishuli river, the largest private sector undertaking, has started.This is also the first run-of-river project in Nepal that will not require a tunnel.The powerhouse will be built at the bottom of the dam in the Trishuli basin. The plant consists of three turbines, two each with 33.33 MW output and one with the 33.4MW optimum capacity.Project developer Blue Energy is said to have started diverting water to build the dam between Butar of Gandaki Municipality, Gorkha, and Chumlingtar of Ichhakamana Municipality, Chitwan.The four-year project started in March 2023.Blue Energy said this would be the first project in Nepal that will need no tunnel to channel dam water as the powerhouse in Butar of Gorkha will be close by.“Around 20 percent of work was completed before Dashain. The work is making satisfactory progress,” said Niranjan Regmi, director of Blue Energy.The total investment is Rs16 billion. As construction is going on in a major river, floods in the rainy season can obstruct work.In the monsoon gone by, Regmi said, massive flooding swept away machinery, transport vehicles, and construction materials. He said the company faced around Rs200 million in damages, particularly in the late September floods.Five barrages will be constructed to discharge the water, said Dibya Raj Panta, the project's geologist. Each barrage is 12-metre high and 5-metre-wide.Normally, the Trishuli river’s flow is 600 cubic metres per second. At the past monsoon’s end, the water flow was measured at 5,000 cusec.The dam has been designed to withstand a maximum flow of 9,800 cusec.Fish ladders will be constructed in one of the five dams to mitigate the impact on the fish populations. The specialised structures are designed to facilitate fish movement through the barriers, allowing them uninterrupted migration routes.After the dam is built, a lake will be formed in Phisling, Chitwan, extending 3.5 km upstream.The electricity produced is proposed to be connected to the national grid in Marki Chowk of Abu Khaireni, Tanahun, 18 km from the project site. “If the transmission line is constructed in the nearby areas before the project's completion, it will be connected to it,” said Panta.The company obtained the survey licence in 2009.Before the earthquake in 2015, a Chinese company was appointed the project contractor. However, due to Covid-19, the work was stalled.The project for civil and hydromechanical works was awarded to CE Construction Pvt Ltd. The deal involves planning, design, engineering and construction. Electro-mechanical works are being done by GE Power India Ltd.Except for the dam, all the project structures are on the Gorkha side at Butar.The project, however, has courted controversy.Himalayan Gorkha Outdoor Resort Private Limited, which is close to the project, has claimed that it incurred losses of Rs50 million in the September flood due to the project. The resort is currently closed.There was a rock hill 200 metres from the resort. “The project removed it, triggering a current to the resort, which caused the damage,” said Mahendra Singh Thapa, the resort's director. He has demanded compensation from the project.“The shutdown of the resort will cause us losses of Rs5 million annually,” said Thapa.Blue Energy officials have denied responsibility for the losses. “The rainfall was unexpected, and the flood was massive. We, too, suffered damages worth millions,” he said.The story has been updated to clarify a point on the project's construction. \nThe 220kV Chilime-Trishuli transmission line project has been completed after seven years of construction. This crucial development in the energy sector is expected to open the doors to electricity trade with China. The Chilime-Trishuli transmission line links two locations: Chilime, a small village close to the Chinese border in the north of Kathmandu in Rasuwa district, and Trishuli, a smaller town in Nuwakot district. According to the Nepal Electricity Authority, this transmission line project is extremely important for Nepal because it will benefit electricity producers and facilitate power trading with the northern neighbour, China.Kulman Ghising, managing director of the Nepal Electricity Authority, said in a statement issued on Monday, \"The Chilime-Kerung international transmission line will be built for electricity trade with China, the neighbouring country to the north. The Chilime-Trishuli transmission line will serve as a link to China.”During the then prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s visit to China in September last year, the two sides signed an agreement to develop the Nepal section of the proposed 220kV Jilong/Kerung-Rasuwagadhi-Chilime cross-border transmission line with a Chinese grant.“The two sides will launch the construction of the Jilong/Kerung-Rasuwagadhi-Chilime 220kV cross-border power transmission line at an early date,” according to the joint statement issued during the visit.The two sides agreed to build the first transmission line connecting the two neighbours. Currently, without grid connectivity with China, Nepal relies solely on India for importing electricity during the dry season and exports its surplus power during the wet season.Around a dozen cross-border transmission lines are already in operation, including one with 400kV capacity to India, while four other 400kV cross-border grids extending southwards are in the pipeline.According to the NEA officials, the Nepal section is 16 km from the China border to the Chilime hub, while the Chinese will need to construct around 80 km from its side to the border.This project is designed to evacuate electricity generated from the Trishuli River basin, marking a significant milestone in Nepal's energy infrastructure.This is the key power evacuation project that would benefit the projects, including the 216MW Upper Trishuli-1, 60MW Upper Trishuli 3A, and the 36MW Upper Trishuli 3B hydroelectric projects. The transmission line would also evacuate power from the 14.6MW Upper Sanjen, 42.5MW Sanjen, 111MW Rasuwagadhi, 14.3MW Upper Mailung, and 5MW Upper Mailung A hydroelectric projects.The 28 km Chilime-Trishuli 220 kV double circuit electricity transmission line has 76 pylons. “The facility would evacuate power from the 111MW Rasuwagadhi Hydropower Project and 42.5MW Sanjen Hydropower Project, both built under the authority's subsidiary company, Chilime Jalvidyut,” said Ghising, adding that the Rasuwagadhi and Sanjen projects have been completed and are in the power generation stage.“This transmission line will also help many other hydropower projects under construction in the area.”\"Erecting a pylon was challenging in many areas. The mountainous terrain meant many places did not have roads, so people or mules had to carry conduction materials like stones, sand, water and pylon parts. Additionally, floods and landslides, forest clearance, local obstacles and Covid-19 also created hurdles,” said Ghising. According to the NEA, 33 pylons had to be constructed in places without access roads.“Despite all odds, we have completed the project through our continuous efforts,” said Ghising.Tharka Bahadur Thapa, chief of the grid operation department of the NEA, said the project built more than 20 kilometres of access roads.He said that nine pylons were constructed by transporting construction materials and equipment by mules and people, while two were built by transporting construction materials by helicopter. In most mountain areas, drones were used to connect the overhead line cables from one pylon to another. The 65 million euro (approximately Rs9.49 billion as per Monday’s exchange rate) project was jointly financed by the German government through its Development Bank KfW (grant of 14 million euro), European Investment Bank (loan of 25 million euro), the European Union under its Asia Investment Facility (2.25 million euro) and the rest by Nepal government.In October 2017, Chinese firm Pinggao Group of Companies was awarded the contract to build the transmission line and substation. The transmission line project includes the construction of the 220/132 kV Trishuli 3B hub substation, the 220/132 kV Chilime substation, and the Chilime-Trishuli 220 kV double-circuit transmission line.The transmission line has been constructed at elevations ranging from 680 to 2,600 metres above sea level.  \nWithout appropriate intervention on universal access to safe drinking water, sanitation and adequate hygiene (WASH) services, the number of malaria and dengue cases in Nepal could increase by up to 27 percent and 44 percent, respectively, over 2011–2040, according to the new study of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) released on Thursday. The report recommended that Developing Asia be made more committed to tackling climate change.Based on a 2023 study supported by the ADB, over 2041–2070, case numbers could rise by as much as 69 percent for malaria and 113 percent for dengue. However, the study said better access to drinking (tap) water and improved household waste management can reduce disease risks by eliminating informal water storage that serves as mosquito breeding sites.The study also showed that Nepal’s investments to reach the Sustainable Development Goals on water and sanitation and improving waste management could reduce infections from malaria by 17 percent and from dengue by 41 percent in urban areas. “Improving WASH services can also deliver other health benefits, such as lessening diarrhoeal disease and increasing good hygiene practices, as well as helping to build resilience to vector-borne diseases.”The ADB research finds the impacts of climate change could reduce gross domestic product (GDP) in developing Asia and the Pacific by 17 percent by 2070 under a high-end greenhouse gas emissions scenario, rising to 41 percent by 2100.Rising sea levels and falling labour productivity would cause the most significant losses, with lower incomes and fragile economies hardest hit. The new research in the inaugural issue of ADB’s Asia-Pacific Climate Report details a series of damaging impacts threatening the region. The report said that if the climate crisis continues to accelerate, up to 300 million people in the region could be threatened by coastal inundation, and trillions of dollars of coastal assets could be damaged annually by 2070.The Sixth Assessment Report of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projects that the risk of vector-borne diseases (e.g., malaria and dengue) will increase if individual economies do not take climate change adaptation measures. Due to increased temperatures and altered weather patterns, more localities will become suitable breeding grounds for disease vectors, such as mosquitoes.“Climate change has supercharged the devastation from tropical storms, heat waves, and floods in the region, contributing to unprecedented economic challenges and human suffering,” said ADB President Masatsugu Asakawa. “Urgent, well-coordinated climate action that addresses these impacts is needed before it is too late.”The report finds that regional public sentiment supports climate action. In an ADB climate change perception study this year, 91 percent of respondents across 14 regional economies said they view global warming as a serious problem, with many seeking more ambitious government action. To address growing climate risks, adaptation responses need to be accelerated, and adaptation-focused climate finance must be greatly upscaled.The report values annual investment needs for regional countries to adapt to global warming at between $102 billion and $431 billion—far exceeding the $34 billion of tracked adaptation finance in the region in 2021–2022. On the mitigation front, the report shows that the region is well placed to embrace renewable energy and drive a transition to net zero and that forging ahead with domestic and international carbon markets can help achieve climate action goals cost-effectively.Investments in WASH can help reduce health risks exacerbated by climate change. The report said that agriculture is vulnerable to increased frequency of extreme climatic events due to climate change. However, achieving goals under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change is likely to depend on expanding carbon sequestration through forests, limiting land availability for agriculture.In most Paris Agreement-compatible emissions pathways scenarios, bioenergy use rises, often combined with carbon capture and storage. Bioenergy production also reduces the land area available for growing food crops.The report said that in 2023, the ADB released a study that models a set of scenarios compatible with the Paris Agreement, then contrasts these scenarios with current policies. This modelling considers both the deployment of bioenergy and expanded forest cover and other energy-related mitigation options. The Paris Agreement compatible scenarios find that the land area for growing food crops in developing Asia will decrease by 36 million hectares by 2050 and 58 million hectares by 2070. Much of this is driven by the expansion of bioenergy crops, which will reach 97 million hectares in the region by 2070. As a result, food prices will reach values 35 percent higher than they would be under current policies by 2065.“Agriculture, therefore, clearly needs adaptation to emissions mitigation policies, as well as to the impacts of climate change, to avoid adverse food security outcomes,” the report said. Climate change will lead to new disease burdens, including new and emerging climate-related vector-borne diseases (e.g., chikungunya, dengue). The G20 High-Level Independent Panel calls for more robust disease surveillance and detection networks, coordinated regional action and information sharing.This will require a significant expansion of surveillance networks and the development of global, regional, and national expertise. Embodied agricultural innovations, including stress-tolerant varieties, can help address climate shifts using existing extension systems. Agricultural research has a key role in adaptation, and related studies provide very positive cost-benefit ratios for investing in research to address climate change risks. High-returns research products include stress-tolerant crop varieties, especially for drought and floods. They require transmission of much more information among farmers. More iterative and interactive extension approaches, such as farmer field schools, demand responsive approaches, such as farmer contracted extension, and gender-sensitive approaches all show promise to improve the adoption of knowledge-intensive practices, according to the report.As climate change may affect the energy sector, the report said there is potential to build climate resilience into energy supply. The Asia and Pacific region is receiving some of the most significant flows of investment into energy supply, with an increasing share of this investment being in green and renewable energy. However, this new infrastructure is vulnerable to climate change, especially given its long lifetime, and it is important to address these climate risks during design, a concept known as ‘climate-proofing’.“Doing so involves low additional costs and is highly cost-effective, generating benefits four times greater than the costs,” the report said.Several smaller economies, including Bhutan, Nepal, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan, generate most of their electricity (86 percent-100 percent) through hydropower.According to the report, substantial investments are needed in generation capacity and energy storage, grid enhancement, and smart grid technologies to manage the intermittent nature of sources such as wind and solar energy and achieve net zero emissions.Meanwhile, the extensive hydropower resources in developing Asia can support grid stability as wind and solar power capacity increases, and enhanced grid interconnection can help mitigate intermittency challenges further.However, effective climate-proofing often requires enabling actions by the government, including changes to design standards.Nepal’s second Nationally Determined Contribution, or NDC, is each country's national climate action plan under the Paris Agreement. The submission provides more details than the first plan. It includes quantified targets for agriculture, energy, forestry, and waste and a commitment to gender equality and social inclusion by empowering women, Indigenous people, and youth in climate policy.Despite these updates, the report said that NDC commitments across developing Asia remain insufficient to align with the Paris Agreement goals.The report said that 44 economies of developing Asia with submitted NDCs all include targets for the energy sector. Still, only 40 include targets for the agriculture, forestry, and other land use sectors.Moreover, just 30 economies have targets for the industry sector despite this sector's crucial role in decarbonisation.Forty- four economies, representing 98 percent of the region’s emissions, have ratified the 2015 Paris Agreement and submitted nationally determined contributions (NDCs) with commitments to cut GHG emissions and adapt to climate change.In addition, 36 of these economies have announced or adopted net-zero targets. However, according to the report, current actions fall short of what is needed to limit the global temperature rise to 2°C or, ideally, 1.5°C.The NDCs and net zero targets lack concrete, sector-specific emission reduction road maps.Implementing decarbonisation plans faces key challenges, including institutional capacity gaps, governance issues, insufficient financing, limited access to technology and expertise, and vulnerability to climate events that divert resources from decarbonisation efforts.The ADB climate change perception survey conducted in 2024 finds that 91 percent of people in 14 economies in developing Asia view climate change as a severe problem. Additionally, 84 percent of respondents report that they and their families are already experiencing climate change impacts or expect to within the next decade.  \n\nA team of senior health officials from the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, who were deployed recently in Gandaki Province to assess the latest situation of the dengue spread, returned with complaints. Along with health workers serving at local bodies and provincial hospitals, elected representatives and local leaders of political parties, with whom they discussed, complained about exorbitant testing charges at private laboratories.“We are aware of the excessive prices being charged by private labs for dengue testing and held discussions about setting a maximum price but couldn't reach a decision,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director at the division. “For the next dengue season, we would make a decision about slashing the testing charges.”Nepal has been witnessing a rapid surge in new cases of dengue infection in recent months. Health authorities, however, do not concede that the number of new dengue cases is rising alarmingly. Doctors say there could be dengue patients in almost all households, especially in the Kathmandu Valley and in major cities like Pokhara.Officials say that state-run health facilities do not charge for dengue testing, and they are aware of excessive charging by private labs despite the significant decline in the cost of rapid diagnostic test kits.“It cost less than 100 rupees for a rapid diagnostic testing kit, but private labs have been charging excessively,” an official at the Department of Health Services said, asking not to be named, as he is not authorised to speak to the media. “Due to a lack of regulation, private labs and hospitals have been fleecing patients, and health officials have been avoiding making decisions to appease the private laboratories and hospitals.”Public health experts say that it was obvious for patients to bear brunt when the authorities concerned, including the health minister, focus on gaining popularity by announcing populist programmes that are not feasible to implement with existing resources.“Some hospitals have been charging up to Rs 3,000 for dengue tests,” said Dr Baburam Marasini, a public health expert. “When the authorities forget their prime duties and fear antogonising private hospitals and labs, it is inevitable that patients will suffer.”Most state run health facilities and labs remained closed during Tihar holidays, which forced infected patients to seek services at private hospitals. Meanwhile, the Department of Health Services said that its attention has been drawn to the excessive charging for dengue testing at private labs.“I have noted the issue and will discuss it with the Health Ministry,” said Dr Bikash Devkota, director general at the Department of Health Services. “We will make some decisions regarding this issue.”Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika viruses, according to the World Health Organisation.So far, only 12 people have died, and over 29,000 have been infected since the start of 2024 if the government data is to be believed. Experts say reported dengue cases may only represent a small fraction of the true scale of the outbreak, as around 90 percent of the infected people do not show any symptoms and health authorities often concealed the actual number of deaths and infections.As there is no specific treatment for dengue, health workers provide symptomatic care and diagnose patients based on symptoms, including platelet-rich plasma transfusion.According to doctors, mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes are some symptoms of dengue.The World Health Organisation (WHO) says there is no specific treatment for severe dengue, but early detection and access to proper medical care can save lives. \nIn rural Madhesh, where cultural norms and limited access to healthcare compound an already fragile health infrastructure, women’s sexual and reproductive health needs are often sidelined.For many women there, awareness of their own bodies and health needs remains a distant reality. Seeking help for sexual and reproductive health (SRH) issues is often a last resort.Seema Kumari Pasman, a 20-year-old from Karmahi village in Dhanusha who the Post is identifying with a pseudonym for privacy, is one such example.Married at 16 in 2019, she quickly became a mother of two children by 2022.After two child births, her menstrual complications worsened, yet she had no frame of reference to understand that what she was experiencing—menorrhagia, or abnormally heavy bleeding—was a medical condition.Pasman endured a year of painful, prolonged periods that she had been taught were simply part of a woman’s life—a burden, not a condition needing treatment.Daily chores became unbearable for her but those around her continued to dismiss her symptoms.One night in December 2023, after collapsing while fetching water from a hand pump, Pasman’s family rushed her to Janakpur Provincial Hospital.There, doctors diagnosed her with severe anaemia from untreated menorrhagia. “The doctors told me that if I had received earlier intervention, my suffering could have been prevented...but I only thought it was normal,” Pasman says.The culture of silence around SRH issues means that women like Pasman get help only when their conditions are critical.A 2018 study in the Journal of Health and Allied Sciences reported low awareness of SRH rights among 384 married Madheshi women in Sarlahi. Three-fifths were unaware of these rights, and the same proportion reported experiences of physical and dowry-related violence.Chandra Rekha Issar, a gynaecologist at Janakpur Provincial Hospital and assistant professor at the Madhesh Institute of Health Sciences (MIHS), says that for many women, the concept of openly talking about SRH—especially with male doctors—is almost unthinkable.In rural Madhesh, as part of ‘ghunghat pratha’, married women have limited interaction with unrelated men outside their family. They are often expected to wear a veil in front of everyone except their husbands and rarely go outside alone for extended periods.This restrictive environment creates a hesitation among women to discuss their SRH. When these women visit a gynaecologist and are assigned a male doctor, it often leads to discomfort.Health consultations can thus become uncomfortable or are avoided altogether, exacerbating a pattern of undiagnosed and untreated conditions.At Janakpur Hospital, this cultural barrier plays out every single day.Kamala Devi Mandal, a 30-year-old woman from Khariyani, Janakpur, sat clutching her veil in the waiting area of the Department of Gynaecology, with her mother in law on the side.When her turn came, Mandal hesitated upon seeing a male gynaecologist, Raj Kishor Pandit, at the door. Despite a female attendant’s presence, Mandal’s mother-in-law ultimately did the talking, while Kamala remained silent, visibly uncomfortable.For Issar, these hesitations are all too familiar. She works alongside male gynaecologists in a department where only four of the 13 doctors are female.“In a setting where women are uncomfortable speaking about reproductive issues, especially with male doctors, we have to proceed carefully, often through the person accompanying the patient,” she says.Most of the female patients are accompanied by family members, as husbands are often working abroad.For something as basic as the date of their last menstrual cycle, the patient often defers to the person accompanying her. “Most of them are under a veil,” Issar added, “and removing it, even for an eye check to assess anaemia, takes coaxing… It requires long counselling for women to open up. At times, the information we receive is incomplete, which creates challenges in treatment.”If patients still hesitate to see a male gynaecologist after counselling, a female gynaecologist is assigned when possible, says Issar. However, this is often unfeasible during busy hours due to limited staff compared to the high patient load.Gynecologist Issar says that about 85 percent of the hospital’s gynaecology and obstetrics cases involve pregnancy-related complications, often worsened by malnutrition, lack of prenatal care, and early marriages.General gynaecology accounts for 15 percent of patients, with menstrual issues like dysmenorrhea and heavy bleeding common among adolescents under 19, while older patients face infections, cervical cancer, and uterine prolapse.Due to early marriages, multiple childbirths, and home deliveries without medical supervision, many women develop uterine prolapse—a condition typically seen in older women but increasingly common in those as young as 30 in rural Madhesh.The gendered expectations that govern interactions in rural Madhesh leave women ill-equipped to advocate for their health.“During a health camp in Saptari, I found that over ten percent of women under 35 had uterine prolapse,” Issar says. “Early marriage and childbirth in an environment without health education or postnatal care have serious consequences.”The barriers also include outdated beliefs and superstitions which affect women’s diet and recovery after childbirth.“Although the situation has improved, women in remote Madhesh are often prohibited from consuming protein-rich foods like chicken soup or meat after giving birth,” says 24 year old Sapana Ray, a bachelor’s student in public health at Madhesh Institute of Health Sciences. “They are typically allowed only one meal of roti and are discouraged from more water and meal, as it’s believed that this prevents colds and other illnesses in the child,” Ray added, “This lack of nutrition contributes to malnutrition and anaemia, exacerbating their health issues.”When rural women lack basic health literacy, common gynaecological issues go unchecked, leading to preventable complications. For instance, over 80 percent of cases at Janakpur Provincial Hospital are critical.“Most of these severe cases could have been prevented with early intervention or just an understanding of basic health,” Issar says.As Issar sees it, comprehensive awareness campaigns are crucial for educating women about sexual and reproductive health.“The government should consider monthly outreach programmes in rural areas. Women in far rural communities need direct, consistent health education,” Issar says. Further, local health posts with trained personnel could provide preventive care and answer questions women may hesitate to bring up in a hospital setting.The hospital’s efforts to include female attendants in male doctors’ consultations and to counsel women on gender-neutral healthcare only go so far. Often, patients’ deep-seated fears and hesitation prove challenging to overcome.While Madhesh’s women struggle with silence and a lack of resources, healthcare professionals are left piecing together fragmented stories, trying to heal patients who are often reluctant to share their suffering. It is a race against time and tradition.Dr Issar says that it’s unfair to blame women for hesitating to discuss their issues with gynaecologists. “We need to understand and empathise with their background,” she says.Many women, living in conservative settings, rarely have the freedom to speak openly. Given this, she questions, “How can we expect them to feel fully comfortable discussing their sexual and reproductive health, especially with a male doctor?” Even for educated urban women, she adds, these conversations can be challenging.According to Ray, consistent ground-level awareness and counselling programmes on SRH are essential, alongside changes to the conservative and predominantly patriarchal settings in rural areas. “These social barriers, even more than medical intervention, are often the primary obstacles to healthcare access for women in these communities,” she says. \nOfficers and employees at the Ministry of Health and Population and the Department of Health Services will receive training on coping with mental health problems.Officials hope that the training will help employees understand common mental health conditions and identify warning signs of depression, anxiety, stress and other psychological issues.“Employees are human beings too and can suffer from various health conditions, including mental health conditions,” said Dr Pomawati Thapa, chief of the Non-communicable Disease and Mental Health Section at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “We have planned to impart one-day training to the employees at the Health Ministry and the Department of Health Services.”Officials say that 80 of the 160 employees serving at the Health Ministry and at the Department of Health Services will receive training first, and the rest will receive it another day. They say the training would be provided to employees of other ministries only if they get positive results from the training imparted to Health Ministry officials.Studies carried out in the past show that the majority of government officials at Singha Durbar suffered from multiple health complications such as hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, kidney diseases, anxiety and depression. Health problems could have been exacerbated since the workplace environment hasn’t improved, the studies showed.Singha Durbar is the country’s federal administrative heart where most ministries and important government offices are located. Reports show that many civil servants are unaware of their health ailments.Doctors say a sedentary lifestyle, poor eating habits and stress contribute to the health crisis among government employees. They advise employees to visit a hospital if they feel something is wrong with their health.Of late, noncommunicable diseases have emerged as the leading killers in Nepal, and its reflection can also be seen among government employees.A 2019 study by the Nepal Health Research Council on the prevalence of noncommunicable diseases found that the diseases accounted for 71 percent of the country's deaths.The study shows that hypertension, diabetes, renal malfunction, liver problems, heart issues and cervical cancer are responsible for the majority of morbidity and mortality in Nepal.The findings showed that the leading risk factor of death in 2019 was smoking, whose attributable death was 17.7 percent, followed by high systolic blood pressure at 12.3 percent, household air pollution at 11.2 percent, ambient air pollution at 9.3 percent, diabetes at 8 percent, and high cholesterol and kidney dysfunction, among others.The study was primarily focused on behavioural risk factors, including tobacco and alcohol consumption, and biological risk factors—raised blood pressure, heavyweight, obesity, abnormal lipid prevalence, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes.To address the growing burden of non-communicable diseases, the government has previously announced that it will carry out free screening of non-communicable diseases of people over 40. However, the programme has not yet been started.Public health experts say the increase in non-communicable diseases is a global phenomenon, but developing countries like Nepal have been facing a double burden.They say that many lives can be saved if people are screened for non-communicable diseases for free. \nAs Minister for Health and Population Pradip Paudel is on a spree announcing one populist programme after another, health agencies under his ministry are reaching out to aid organisations for small amounts to basic training.Officials say they do not even have the budget to provide mental health screening training to children and adolescents, and this has delayed the planned programme.“We have been asking aid agencies for help to carry out training programmes for health workers,” an official at the Health Ministry said, asking not to be named as he is not authorised to speak to the media. “The minister is busy unveiling new free programmes but does not bother to learn about the real problems.”On Monday and Tuesday, Minister Paudel announced three free programmes that include free treatment for children under 14 with cancer, free treatment and health check-ups for women soccer players injured in matches, and upgrades to the Sailaja Acharya Heart Disease Centre in Biratnagar. Last week, Paudel pledged free care for poor burn victims who cannot afford treatment. However, most health facilities offering burn care provide only basic treatments, which often puts patients' safety at risk. Since taking office three months ago, Minister Paudel has announced several other populist programmes.While most of these initiatives—which include reducing hospital wait times, increasing government health insurance coverage to Rs500,000, and providing outpatient care on public holidays—have yet to be implemented, Paudel continues to announce more free programmes.Experts have questioned the effectiveness and sustainability of such programmes stating that previous ministers and governments would also have made similar decisions if there were simple solutions.“Only those who are unaware of the limitations and working style of our health system could be impressed by these populist announcements, but the reality is quite different,” said Sagar Rjbhandari, a health expert. Many other health programmes, including nutritious food for pregnant and nursing mothers and children in Karnali Province, as well as maternal and perinatal death surveillance, among others, have been affected by budget constraints in the current fiscal year.Health Ministry officials said they have requested UNICEF for financial help to impart mental health screening training of children for health workers.“We need around Rs700,000 to train health workers, including doctors, nurses, and paramedics, on mental health screening for children and adolescents,” said Dr Pomawati Thapa, chief of the Non-communicable Disease and Mental Health Section at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “UNICEF has responded positively to our request. A four-day screening training will be organised in the fourth quarter of the current fiscal year.”Officials said that they plan to train 150 health workers.“We hope that the health worker training will help reduce existing mental health problems among children and adolescents,” said Thapa. “Those serving in primary health care centres will be trained first to ensure that children and adolescents in villages will easily access the services.”A report from the National Mental Health Survey Nepal-2020 shows that the prevalence of mental disorders among adolescents was 5.2 percent that year, and neurotic and stress-related disorders were the most common at 2.8 percent.Likewise, the prevalence of current suicidal thoughts among adolescents was around four percent, while the rate of suicidal attempts in the same age group was 0.7 percent. The report also shows that 0.6 percent of children and adolescents were found to have been suffering from depression.The prevalence of suicidality, including current suicidal thoughts, lifetime suicidal attempts, and the future likelihood of suicidal thoughts, was found to affect 7.2 percent of the population.Experts say that mental health problems in children and adolescents could be several times more than what the survey portrays. They say that around 10 to 15 percent of the total children and adolescent population could have been suffering from various types of mental health issues, and due to methodological problems, the survey may not accurately portray the actual problems.Health officials say that there are only around half a dozen child and adolescent psychiatric doctors in the country, and only a few are serving in state-run health facilities. Similarly, the major contributors to the treatment gap are societal beliefs, traditions and stigma associated with mental disorders, according to experts.“This training will help health workers identify problems and refer patients to health facilities with child psychiatrists and psychologists,” said Thapa.Studies show the magnitude of suffering, the burden and costs for individuals, families and societies arising from mental health disorders are alarming in Nepal. \nDozens of children with severe urological birth defects and rare urological conditions in HCM City, Vinh, Hà Nội and Đà Nẵng are receiving free genital surgeries under the ‘Thiện Nhân & Friends’ programme – a project that offers child genital reconstruction surgeries in Việt Nam.Part of an annual programme that started 18 years ago, these surgeries are being performed from October 18 to November 9 by a volunteer medical team from Italy, England, Egypt and the UAE, led by Italian surgeon Dr Roberto De Castro.The surgeries take place at Children’s Hospital 2 in HCM City, the Nghệ An Obstetrics and Pediatrics Hospital in Vinh City, the National Pediatric Hospital and Việt Đức Hospital in Hà Nội, and the Đà Nẵng Children and Women’s Hospital in Đà Nẵng City.Over decades, Dr De Castro has performed pioneering surgical techniques to effectively treat genital malformations and injuries in both boys and girls to allow them to live full lives.One of De Castro’s biggest success stories is Phùng Thiện Nhân, who was abandoned by his biological mother at birth in a remote area in the central province of Quảng Nam. When Nhân was found three days later, he was barely alive and had lost most of his genitals and one leg due to a brutal attack by wild animals.The infant survived the incident and was subsequently adopted by journalist Trần Mai Anh, moving to Hà Nội with his new family. With the support of De Castro, Thiện Nhân received successful reconstructive surgery in January 2011.His foster mother, Mai Anh, later became the founder of the ‘Thiện Nhân & Friends’ programme which, together with the Asia Injury Prevention (AIP) Foundation, pays for surgeries, travel costs and medical supplies for poor Vietnamese children needing genital reconstruction.Over the years, the ‘Thiện Nhân & Friends’ programme has conducted 630 surgeries, examinations and diagnoses for 2,000 children, with another 1,000 patients still awaiting treatment.Dozens of leading experts in paediatric reconstructive and urological surgery from around the world have participated in the programme. In Việt Nam, along with conducting examinations and surgeries, the international specialists also hold scientific workshops and hands-on training sessions with Vietnamese medical staff, sharing their experiences and introducing the latest advanced methods in paediatric urological surgery.According to founder of the AIP Foundation and co-founder of the ‘Thiện Nhân & Friends’ programme Greig Craft, the mission of the progamme is not just to treat a small number of children with genital disabilities.“By spreading the inspiration to live and sharing medical knowledge as leading experts come together, we believe that the impact will extend beyond the confines of the programme. We are fortunate that Thiện Nhân, our first patient, shares this vision and has chosen to become a scientist in the future,” he said.Eighteen years after being found in the jungle and given a second chance at life, Thiện Nhân has entered university. He chose the field of Artificial Intelligence, believing that “AI has the potential to revolutionise healthcare and improve the lives of many people, just as my life was transformed through medical intervention”. From these 18 years of experience, the young man is convinced that “empathy and patience will lead to miraculous achievements”.-In Association with ANN \nDusit Princess Kathmandu is organising a five-day trout festival at its SOI restaurant. The dishes will be available for order from 12:30 pm to 10:00 pm every day till August 30. In celebration of Nepal’s rivers and lakes, which provide an ideal environment for high-quality trout, the Director of Culinary Food and Beverage Service, Chef Utpal Mondal, and his team at Dusit Princess Kathmandu have crafted a menu showcasing the flavours and versatility of locally sourced trout. “As the festive month of Shrawan ends, people focus on healthy and nutritious food. Trout, rich in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and essential minerals, offers a heart-friendly option that checks all the boxes from a nutritional and culinary standpoint,” says Mondal.He adds that the goal of the culinary event is to offer their guests a rare opportunity to experience a wide variety of trout dishes they wouldn’t typically find at home.The event menu features twelve unique dishes, six of which are drawn from diverse culinary traditions across continents. Three dishes are inspired by oriental cuisine, while the remaining three highlight flavours from Nepal and India. The menu has been designed to include various dishes, from soups and starters to main courses, including Mexican, Italian, Continental, and Thai flavours.While discussing the event’s highlights, Mondal said, “The celebration presents a unique opportunity for guests to indulge in a diverse range of trout-based dishes, something they wouldn’t typically have the chance to experience elsewhere.” \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nNepal wrapped up their turbulent year in the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup League 2 with a point against Scotland after their match was called off due to bad weather on Monday.Nepal were looking to complete a double against the Scots after thrashing them by five wickets in the first leg of the United States Tri-Series that also helped them register their first League 2 win in eight months.The Rhinos were invited to field first after losing the toss in a rain-delayed match at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas, the United States, but the play was suspended again when the Rhinos were at 26-1 in six overs. The match was then officially called off due to lightning and tornadoes.Nepal lost both League 2 matches against hosts US (by three wickets and 37 runs).The outcome means Nepal ended their chaotic year managing just two wins in 12 League 2 matches as they sit in the seventh position in the eight-team standings. Their match against Oman during the Canada Tri-Series was also abandoned due to rain.Nepal play their next tri-series of the League 2 in Scotland in May next year. \nChitwan Rhinos, one of the eight franchise teams of the inaugural Nepal Premier League (NPL) T20 cricket tournament, have signed Namibia batter Jan Nicol Loftie-Eaton.The 23-year-old Namibian hitman will join South African Marchant de Lange, English Luc Benkenstein and Afghanistan’s Hassan Eisakhil in the Chitwan squad.The NPL is scheduled to take place from November 30 to December 21.Left-handed batter Loftie-Eaton broke the record for the fastest T20I hundred in the men’s cricket last year (now joint second fastest), a feat he achieved during Namibia's 20-run victory against Nepal in the Nepal T20I Tri-Nation Series in Kathmandu. Loftie-Eaton brought up his century in just 33 balls, eclipsing Kushal Malla’s record by one ball (currently fourth fastest in the list).Malla is the marquee signing of Chitwan.“I have fond memories of TU Cricket Ground,” Loftie-Eaton said after joining Chitwan. “It gave me one of the most iconic innings in T20I cricket. It’s time to do more of the same for Chitwan Rhinos at the Nepal Premier League in front of passionate Nepali cricket fans.”Chitwan’s Managing Director Aayush Neupane said: “It is there to see what Loftie-Eaton can do in T20 cricket. Nepali cricket fans saw him break Kushal’s record last season at the TU Ground. Now, both the swashbucklers will play for the same team. Fasten your seat belts.”Chitwan bought Rijan Dhakal, Kamal Airee, Sharad Vesawakar, Bipin Rawal, Santosh Karki, Dipesh Shrestha, Amar Singh Rautela, Deepak Bohara, Ranjeet Kumar and Gautam KC through auction last month. \nEnglish cricketer Stephan Eskinazi, known for his aggressive batting, joined Kathmandu Gurkhas for the Nepal Premier League T20 tournament starting on November 30.\nIn the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup League 2, Nepal lost to the US by 37 runs despite Anil Sah's 52 and Sompal Kami's late 46, falling short of the US's 281-8 total set by Monank Patel's 67, Saiteja Mukkamalla's 75, and Harmeet Singh's 59.\nNetanyahu and Israeli supporters celebrated Trump's election, while Hamas urged an end to \"blind support\" for Israel, with Trump's win potentially shifting Israel's international support and relations with the US.\nThe tradition of kite flying in Kathmandu, dating back to ancient China and introduced through traders, was both religiously and socially significant, involving kite fights, love letters, and competitions. Despite difficulties in securing materials and preparing thread, kite makers and sellers flourished during Dashain and used different types of kites made from Nepali paper or imported from Lucknow. Kite enthusiasts filled rooftops and open grounds, cheering for their favorites and celebrating the cutting of other kites' lines with the sound of \"chait.\" The season culminated in a grand event at Budhanilakantha, but the lack of open spaces, urbanization, and modern entertainment have led to a decline in the kite culture in recent decades.\nFrom 2008 to 2017, Matina Shakya served as Kumari, a goddess worshipped in Nepal, while Trishna Shakya took over in 2017; the tradition has evolved to prioritize the education and well-being of Kumaris and ex-Kumaris.\nJuddha Shumsher Rana's zoo in Jawalakhel, established in 1932, housed a diverse collection of animals, including elephants, horses, deer, monkeys, tigers, rhinos, leopards, red pandas, bears, civets, antelope, gorals, pheasants, monals, and even exotic species like crocodiles and porcupines, potentially including a lion.\nOn the fourth day of the five-day Tihar festivities, an enterprising person had fastened an ox to a temple pillar for the convenience of worshippers. Perhaps the bovine was transported from somewhere outside of Kathmandu Valley in a truck and then tethered by the side of a Shakta shrine close to a busy street. The ox appeared dazed, and its eyes looked glazed as it tried to yank some marigolds off garlands that the worshippers had put around its neck.Despite the relative flatness of rice paddies along riverbanks in the Nepal valley, the Newa community have historically resisted the temptation of using bullocks for pulling ploughs or drawing carts. Since the Nandi bull is revered as the sacred mount of Lord Shiva, all bullocks are deities requisitioned on Goru Tihar even in the hills and mountains where its utility as a drought animal is considered either impractical or sacrilegious. The importance of the bull for the cowherds of the Gopal kings that ruled over settlements in and around the Nepal valley nearly 3,500 years ago is indisputable. However, it wasn’t as inseparable with the everyday life of the pastoralists as with the farmers in the Indo-Gangetic Great Plains. Rather than castrate and domesticate male calves, cowherds allowed their bulls to roam free in the wilderness.One hardly needs to dedicate a day to worship the oxen as every day is the bull’s day in the Kathmandu valley. Ritualised practices, however, acquire religious, spiritual, or cultural connotations after multiple repetitions over time and become an integral part of the collective behaviour.Since events, personalities, practices and experiences aren’t always recorded, it needs constant retelling and multiple recounting for the remembrance of the past to solidify into myths of collective memory. Every narration, however, is a recreation—sometimes even a complete fabrication—of an imagined rather than an authentic past. Most, if not all, festivals are about collective memories: Various stories about a successful hunt of a dangerous predator in the land or water, the victory of a tribal chieftain over a more powerful aggressor, the sacrifice of a holy soul for the good of all, the challenges of sowing or the joys of harvesting and sometimes just the celebration of a pleasant season. Layers of legends and myths get added to various memorialised days as they become common festivals of the yearly calendar in different parts of the world. Since Hinduism is a collection of faiths with multiple deities and many sacred texts, unlike religions of “one God, his chosen Messenger and the holy Book”, it has more festive occasions of fasting, feasting and merrymaking than almost any other culture. But the dual processes of Brahmanisation of indigenous practices and marketisation of traditions have turned almost every festival into an event of ostentatious celebration, conspicuous consumption and thus invariably an expensive affair.Cultural SanskritisationWhen sociologist M.N. Srinivas (1916-1999) found that the “process by which a low caste or a tribe or a group changes its customs, ritual, ideology and way of life in the direction of a high twice-born caste” was more than Brahmanisation and included the adoption of lifestyles of dominant castes by the aspiring section of the erstwhile dominated groups, he began to use Sanskritisation for the method of upward mobility. Analogous to modernisation in many post-colonial cultures, Sanskritisation was the preferred way of establishing acceptability in the Chaturvarna society. The process of Sanskritisation transforms existing practices, absorbs folklores, co-opts tribal heroes, pulls myths into Sanskrit texts, renames rituals and adopts local deities as different avatars of the Hindu Trinity or the eternal Shakti. Last, but not the least, it often institutes a role for the Brahmin priests. Eventually, the socio-economic origins of a festive occasion are forgotten as it becomes a cultural practice with its prescribed rituals. Through multiple repetitions, memories get modified, and then a sanctified way of celebration is eventually established.It's possible to argue that Dashain in the mountains and valleys of the Mahabharata Ranges signified the end of monsoon: A short interlude of autumn for hunter-gatherers, a brief break for the farmers before the harvesting began, an occasion for tradesmen to embark on a journey to or from home, a sunny but balmy weather for everyone and hence a time to show one’s gratitude to Mother Nature through a family affair.The Shakta sect first appropriated Dashain through the legend of Mahishasura Mardini—a form of Durga, the fierce protector of durg, the Sanskrit term for fortress. The Vaishnavas of the Ganga plains added the lore of Lord Ram burning demon-king Ravana with fiery arrows. Adherents of the Shaiva sect are indifferent to the religious significance and continue to mark Dashain as a cultural event of family reunion with food, drink, songs, dance and games.Mindless marketisationThe Brahmanisation process of Sanskritisation seems to have mutated into Vaisyakaran or commercialisation of festivals with manipulators of the market pushing conspicuous consumption and pretentious religiosity. It made sense to get new clothes before Dashain to prepare the family for the coming winter, but luring gullible masses into borrowing to buy consumer durables that they can ill-afford is a symptom of mindless marketisation.Somewhat like Dashain for the hunter-gatherers, the Yam Panchak probably began as a tribute to the forces of nature after the farming revolution that made a settled life possible: Crows as a sign of human habitation, dogs as guards of cattle, cows as givers of milk, oxen as pullers of plough and finally the bonding between brothers and sisters to keep the extended family intact. The day of the crow (Kaag Tihar) was first appropriated as the Dhanbantari Jayanti to honour the healer-sage of yore. Then it became the day to mark the acquisition of household goods and now more gold is sold and bought on the “day of good health”, which has now become Dhanteras, than any other occasion. Adherents ritually worship crows, dogs, cows and oxen but alarm pet parents and frighten birds and animals by bursting firecrackers.Incidentally, legends of Nepal Sambat of Newa community (the largesse of Shankhadhar Sakhwa) and Bestu Varas (Lord Krishna protecting pastoralists from the fury of Indra) of Gujratis are different, but both mark the beginning of a new accounting year for the traders. The season of festivities will end with the five-day-long Chhath Mahaparva of the Greater Mithila that includes large swathes of land where Bajjika, Bhojpuri, Hindi, Magahi and Nepali are the chosen languages of communication now. It has spread with the diaspora of the region all over the world.Just as Dashain and Deepawali were folk festivals before Sanskritisation, Chhath was a penance of commoners to appease Mother Nature present in the five elements of life: Earth, fire, water, air and sky. The word Chhath is said to be derived from Shashthi Tithi, but Chhaith in Maithili simply meant ‘She is’: Omnipresent, timeless, formless, nameless and generous. Sneaking Sanskritisation is ritualising observance, creeping commercialisation is leading towards competitive display of wealth and misguided marketisation is adding land, air, water, fire and sound pollution. May Chhathi Maiya forgive her devotees who have forgotten the inviolability of Mother Nature and bless us all with health, happiness and mindfulness.   \nRoad crashes claim nearly 11.9 lakh lives globally every year, with two to five crore people suffering non-fatal injuries (as of 2023 data). Among these, vulnerable road users (VRUs)—including pedestrians, motorcyclists, and cyclists—account for over half of all traffic-related deaths. Pedestrians, in particular, face significant risks as they lack protection when sharing the road with vehicles. Crossing the road is especially hazardous, with many incidents occurring in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where inadequate infrastructure exacerbates the danger.Bangladesh is not immune to these challenges. Roadside environments near schools, factories, and commercial centres generate high volumes of pedestrian crossings, especially along major highways. Without proper infrastructure, crossing the road can be life-threatening; the road traffic fatality rate in the country is alarmingly high, at 102.1 fatalities per 10,000 vehicles—over 10 times the Southeast Asian average. In 2018, massive student protests erupted in Bangladesh after two high school students were killed in a road crash, highlighting the urgency of improving pedestrian safety. Traditionally, highway agencies have implemented at-grade crossings like zebra crossings or built footbridges and underpasses, but pedestrian usage of these facilities remains low.In developing countries like Bangladesh, the debate over pedestrian safety often revolves around two main points: poor infrastructure design and road user behaviour. While road authorities and professionals often attribute pedestrian injuries and fatalities to the reckless actions of pedestrians and drivers, the users themselves frequently point to inadequate and unsafe facilities. However, ensuring road safety, particularly for vulnerable users such as students and workers commuting across highways, requires shared responsibility and collaboration between authorities and the public.The Safe System approach emphasises that authorities are primarily responsible for providing safe infrastructure. However, road users' needs and behaviours must also be considered to create effective and lasting solutions. Unfortunately, these user-centred elements (i.e. understanding pedestrian behaviour and promoting positive change) are often overlooked in the design of road interventions in Bangladesh.A recent study examined the institutional design practices in Bangladesh and explored the benefits of using a participatory design process, known as co-design, alongside a behaviour change framework to enhance pedestrian safety. The study's goal was to identify how these methods could improve the effectiveness of road safety interventions, reduce injuries and fatalities, and promote shared responsibility among stakeholders.In Bangladesh, professionals from local road agencies first proposed conventional design interventions at four highway sites known for high pedestrian traffic. Focus group discussions were then held with students and workers—those most at risk while crossing these highways. Following these discussions, four co-design workshops were conducted, allowing road users to collaborate with professionals in creating safety interventions. To further enhance the design process, a behaviour change model, COM-B (Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation influencing Behaviour), was integrated into some of the workshops. The study's methodology involved comparing interventions created solely by professionals with those developed through co-design, as well as evaluating the added benefits of incorporating the COM-B model. The efficacy of each intervention was assessed through safety evaluations and stakeholder feedback.The results were striking. Co-designed interventions—created in collaboration with road users—demonstrated significant improvements in usability and safety compared to conventional designs. The participants contributed valuable insights into the practical challenges they face, enabling the creation of more intuitive and effective infrastructure. Incorporating the COM-B model yielded even more positive outcomes, addressing not only design flaws but also encouraging safer crossing behaviour among pedestrians.Perhaps one of the most critical findings was the shift in perception among stakeholders. Interviews revealed that co-design fostered a sense of shared responsibility, breaking the blame cycle where authorities and road users point fingers at each other. By involving users in the design process, stakeholders gained a better understanding of the challenges faced by pedestrians and began working collaboratively to find solutions.Bangladesh is not alone in its struggle to protect vulnerable road users. Worldwide, VRUs, especially in LMICs, are disproportionately affected by road crashes. Pedestrians in these regions often rely on outdated or poorly designed infrastructure, while intervention strategies from high-income countries (HICs) primarily focus on vehicle passengers and may not be applicable in LMIC contexts. Designing effective solutions requires an understanding of local injury patterns and the unique challenges faced by pedestrians.The Safe System approach, widely advocated in HICs, emphasises authorities' responsibility to ensure road safety through proper design and infrastructure. However, in many LMICs, the gap between user behaviour and infrastructure use remains unaddressed. As the study in Bangladesh highlights, interventions that fail to consider user behaviour are unlikely to succeed, no matter how well-designed they may appear on paper. By combining co-design with behaviour change models like COM-B, authorities can create interventions that not only meet safety standards but also encourage proper usage.The findings of this study underscore the potential of co-design and behaviour change models to transform road safety for vulnerable users. By involving pedestrians in the design process, authorities can ensure that crossing facilities are both safe and intuitive to use. Furthermore, the integration of the COM-B model helps address behavioural factors that influence road safety, leading to more effective and sustainable interventions.In Bangladesh and other developing nations, where resources for road safety are often limited, these innovative approaches offer a cost-effective solution. Co-design promotes shared responsibility, while behaviour change models help bridge the gap between user behaviour and safe infrastructure use. As Bangladesh moves forward, adopting these strategies could significantly reduce pedestrian injuries and fatalities, creating a safer road environment for all.—The Daily Star (Bangladesh)/ANN \nThe global order is crumbling rapidly. It appears nowhere near the Schumpeterian idea of creative destruction; Jacques Derrida's deconstruction theory, therefore, barely posits the optimism of legendary phoenix-like revival. The global playground of powers is now without a custodian or a referee to stop the ratchet. It is almost axiomatic that the global order is critical to global governance, which is inevitable for global peace and prosperity. In this increasingly interconnected world, societal and national orders are also largely contingent on the global order and the outcome of the geopolitics of the governance, whether good or bad.The imperative of global governance was desperately realised in the 1940s after the two devastating Great Wars. As a result, essentially, the United Nations (UN), World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF), General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT, now WTO) and similar other multilateral institutions were established. So far, hundreds of international treaties, conventions and covenants have been drafted and implemented or enforced, at least in theory. However, due to the rapidly widening gap between expectation and (in)effectiveness (or helplessness?), these institutions and instruments, mainly the UN and its agencies, are now being questioned regarding the rationale of their very existence.Without a refereeThe end of the Russia-Ukraine war is nowhere on the horizon. Russian President Vladimir Putin appears to be consolidating his legitimacy through forums like Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS). Economic sanctions on Russia by Western countries have had little impact due to the unhindered revenue flow from oil and gas supplied to Europe and Asia. The Gaza crisis is spreading to the entire Arab world and, perhaps, beyond. The foreign policy of the United States on Gaza and Israel seems pressed between its interest in protecting the Israeli state and saving its democratic credentials by stopping inhuman excesses at the Israeli war targets. Digital, communication and transportation technologies, such as artificial intelligence, the Internet and drones, are being used more for destructive purposes, such as starting wars, rather than serve humanity. Trade wars have intensified. The global debt balloon has spiralled out of control, and so has the climate crisis. So, apprehensions abound that we may be on the verge of World War III.Personalities like UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres often cry foul from the fringes, but there are no takers of it. The UN is unable to safeguard its agency, UNWRA (The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East), against the formal Israeli allegations of colluding with the groups that Israel has labelled as 'terrorists'. They are even incapable of admonishing the countries that are blatantly engaged in arms sales and doing nothing tangible to mitigate the potential threat of nuclear war. The leaders of powerful nations on the frontline continue to disregard international laws, rules or norms, sine qua non for maintaining global order and, thereby, ensuring fair global governance.Of course, there is a broader age-old unanswered question surrounding the very design of these institutions, choice of location for their headquarters, personnel selection processes, modus operandi and funding mechanisms. All these aspects were ab initio at the control and mercy of the same group of powerful nations that often choose to flout the so-called international rules and norms. The current international governance mayhem is akin to a game without a referee capable of flagging a foul to powerful global players who are quarrelling rather than respecting the game of rules.Throb of repolarisationThe debate over the shift of the global power poles and the emergence of multipolarity is gaining currency. However, the throb and thong of creating, recognising and sustaining multiple such poles have fiercely gripped the world. The emerging potential poles are keen to build new alliances, while the existing ones exert all efforts not to lose their grip. This has resulted in multifaceted tit-for-tat actions and reactions among the countries through diplomatic rows, strategic bans and fresh trade barriers.Within days after Putin appeared in a triumphant mood regarding his ability to invite leaders from 36 countries for the 16th BRICS Summit in Russia on 22-24 October, the US government on October 30 imposed ‘sanctions on nearly four hundred entities and individuals for enabling Russia’s illegal war against Ukraine.’ This action targets multiple sectors essential to Russia’s war effort.’ This includes the ‘entities and individuals’ from China, India, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Türkiye, Switzerland, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) who continue to sell ‘important dual-use goods to Russia, including critical components that the country relies on for its weapons systems to wage war against Ukraine.’Extracting allegianceThis United States’ move is critical since it involves putative allies and big trade partners like India, Switzerland and the UAE. India is part of ‘the Quad’, the group of four countries (the other three being Australia, Japan and Australia) created out of large ‘democracies’ in the Indo-Pacific region. They had a summit in the last week of September in Washington, DC. The US sanction to 19 Indian entities and two Indian nationals comes at a time when its diplomatic row with Canada, one of the closest US allies, is at its height. Its trade deficit with Russia was $57.14 billion last year against the export of only $4.26 billion. India is among the countries which continued to import Russian oil during the Western sanctions. Nepal is one of the beneficiaries of stable oil prices that are maintained due to this supply. The American move appears to extract unconditional allegiance from India, moving away from Russian engagement. The tug-of-war of creating or breaking alliances is poised to only be nastier in the future.The most alarming and dangerous trait is that the war, financing billions from these rich countries, has been forthcoming and instant. However, humanitarian and development assistance to the developing world has been asymptotic to zero for decades. What’s more, the governments and parliaments of these countries are approving these finances to the parties of their interest at the cost of astronomical debt burden to their treasuries. The IMF estimates that the global public debt will exceed $100 trillion, or about 93 percent of the global gross domestic product, by the end of this year. Only two countries, the US and China, account for 50 percent of it—$36 trillion and 16 trillion, respectively. There is no mechanism to tame them. \nLow-quality goods and price manipulation are rampant in Nepali markets. Are the milk and butter we are buying fresh? What about rice, lentils, noodles and other goods in groceries? And are we being sold fake sneakers and jeans slapped with the labels of popular brands? Also, who among us has not been frustrated when we order one thing online and something completely different arrives? It’s frustrating. But there is hope on the horizon. Starting December, the government plans to establish a consumer court in Kathmandu to hear the consumers’ grievances and complaints against unethical market practices. The court is finally coming into being, nearly three years after a Supreme Court directive. Consumer protection in Nepal has for long been overlooked. The Consumer Protection Act 2018 did mandate the establishment of consumer courts, but there were significant delays in its implementation. This in turn emboldened unscrupulous traders and led to the proliferation of their businesses. Meanwhile, Nepali consumers, long used to getting shoddy deals, have long since stopped complaining. But the new court will allow them to resolve even minor issues quickly and effectively within a specialised setting guided by judges who are experts in consumer law. Consumers only need a bill of goods and services to file a case and they will not have to wait long for a hearing.But there is also bad news. This service is only limited to the federal capital, Kathmandu, which will initially hear cases from Lalitpur, Kathmandu and Bhaktapur. Plans are underway for an extension to other districts and provinces, but officials fear lack of adequate budget and bureaucratic hurdles may hinder such an expansion. Some local units have acted against malpractices and punished businesspersons who cheat on customers, but these initiatives are insufficient. What we really need is a nationwide network of consumer courts. Last fiscal year alone, the Department of Food Technology and Quality Control filed 178 cases in the District Administration Office, Kathmandu. These cases were related to processed drinking water, food items, lentils, sweet items, oil and ghee, milk and dairy items, and spices. The department recorded many cases of substandard products produced by major brands like Bhat-Bhateni food products, Dabur Nepal, CG Oil and Derivatives and Pokhara Noodles. These businesses were found to be flouting Nepal’s consumer laws and compromising people’s health. Consumer protection provisions were thus due. Now that the country is embarking on the journey of establishing consumer courts, there should be no further delays. Expansion of the courts beyond the confines of Kathmandu Valley should not be a big problem too. We hear of large chunks of budgets of all three levels of government in Nepal going unspent every single year. What better way to spend the money than in ensuring that people get value for their money—at a time unjustified price hikes and selling of fakes is giving them a lot of headache? This is why United Nations Guidelines for Consumer Protection recognise the “access to and availability dispute resolution and redress mechanism as a basic need of consumers”. That is also among people’s basic rights as taxpayers.  \nFrequent plane crashes, natural disasters, poor infrastructure and bureaucratic challenges—they all ail Nepali tourism. There is a dire need to ramp up efforts to get it on track. But then we as a country are taking a step back when the rest of the world is looking to boost tourism with robust plans and policies. The Civil Aviation Authority’s latest decision to close Tribhuvan International Airport—Nepal’s only ariel gateway for foreign tourists and the sole door of opportunities for millions of its citizens—for 10 hours (10 pm to 8 am) to complete a long-overdue taxiway expansion, has garnered national and international criticism for the strain it will put on the country’s tourism.While there is nothing wrong with the project to renovate taxiways that have worn out from years of use, the authorities perhaps didn’t consider its impact on tourism and passengers seriously. The airport closure from November 8 to March 31 is bound to inconvenience foreign visitors as it coincides with both autumn and spring peak trekking seasons. Festivals, family reunions, holidays and favourable weather make this season the perfect time to travel to Nepal. Such a prolonged halt will only dampen people’s enthusiasm. One is left wondering why such a vital time was chosen for these renovations.The financial repercussions are substantial. The Nepal Tourism Board, which had aimed for 1.3 million tourists this year, has cut down the expected number to 1.1 million. This could lead to a revenue loss of around Rs50 billion for the airline and tourism industry. Indirect cost could be many times higher. International airlines have cut flights or cancelled tickets at short notice, taking airfares to all-time highs. For instance, the most popular destination in November, Sydney, which would have cost Rs85,000 on normal days, will now cost Rs217,000 (for the highest priced tickets) and Rs114,000 (lowest). For average Nepali workers and students, these fares are unaffordable. Tourism entrepreneurs are facing losses as hotels are reporting cancellations.In 2019, for the same project, the airport was closed for seven hours (11:30 pm to 6:30 am) after which 24/7 operations began for the first time to compensate for the lost flight hours. Earlier this year, too, for the very project, landings from the northern side of the airport were barred, but there were no airport closures. Given these precedents, one would have expected more robust planning this time. Instead, it seems there has not been enough homework. The civil aviation authorities’ efforts to manage the Kathmandu airport’s congestion by redirecting traffic to Pokhara and Gautam Buddha international airports have also failed because no foreign airline operator is willing to fly to these destinations. Travel trade entrepreneurs lament that this “unplanned construction” is taking too long and fear it might extend to spring, another peak tourist season. This is understandable given Nepal’s poor record in completing roads and infrastructure. They have also urged the authorities to limit the shutdown to five hours. However, that risks further delaying the project. A balanced approach that prioritises tourism and passengers while ensuring timely completion is the best. The International Air Transport Association’s (IATA) request that the authorities shorten the closure or spare high-traffic days is logical. Halting operations at peak arrival and departure is neither wise nor sustainable. Ultimately, the health of the country’s civil aviation is closely linked to the state of its regulator. Right now, it appears that our top aviation officials are working more for themselves than for the benefit of the intended beneficiaries.  \nNepal has again shown how ill-prepared and neglectful it is about running a project built and handed over by a foreign friend. This has been Nepal’s chronic problem mainly after the 1990 political change: Nepali authorities have turned several entities built by or with the support of foreign donors into non-functioning bodies. The latest victim of neglect is the Jayanagar-Kurtha cross-border railway. India’s Konkan Railways Corporation Limited (KRCL) has been helping Nepal operate the railway by providing its staffers to run trains along the route. The Indian Railway Construction International Limited had built the section and handed it over to the Nepal Railway Company Limited in June last year. Erstwhile prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi jointly flagged off the railway, which is considered a milestone in cross-border connectivity between the two countries.As Nepal’s only railway company had no trained staff to run the trains, the Indian company, KRCL, agreed to provide the human resources until the Nepali side had necessary staff, including technicians. The Indian company was also ready to train Nepalis. For that, all the Nepali side needed to do was select people and send them for training across the border. But Nepali authorities failed to do even that bare minimum. Eventually, the Indian company wrote to the Nepali side asking either to renew the contract that expires in December or terminate it. As Nepali authorities are still unprepared to run the train, they are planning to extend the contract with the KRCL for another year. The Indian company provides 28 railway technicians, including engine drivers, whom the local railway administration has been paying hefty amounts in salaries and perks. This is not the first project built with the support of a friendly country that Nepal has failed to run properly. In the 1970s, China built a 13-kilometre trolley bus route where buses operated through overhead electric cables from Kathmandu to Bhaktapur. Within years of China handing over the mass transit project, it started facing one after another managerial problems. Eventually, the project collapsed and the Nepal government closed it in 2009. The case of the Jayanagar-Kurtha cross-border railway will inspire no trust among either India or China, the two neighbours, both of whom supposedly want to boost rail connectivity with Nepal. The Indian side has been working to develop a cross-border Raxaul-Kathmandu railway line. The Indian company KRCL last year submitted its location survey report for the proposed line. Similarly, a China-Nepal cross-border railway project connecting Chinese city Kerung and Nepal’s capital Kathmandu has long been a stuff of Nepali dreams.For a relatively poor country like Nepal, there is no alternative to taking support from other countries to develop big projects. But such ventures should be taken as opportunities for both technology and skill transfer. Yet that is apparently not how the authorities in Kathmandu see things. If the country can’t build certain projects on its own, it should at least have a clear vision and a plan on how to run the ones it accepts from generous donors. If the country continues to be neglectful of the support of its foreign friends, not only will it reflect poorly on Nepal’s standing as a trusted partner. It will also show that the country is uninterested in learning from its friends abroad and in time developing its own capabilities to run vital projects and ventures. If Nepal cannot help itself, it is useless to seek outside help.  \nFormer Election Commissioner Bhojraj Pokharel, despite successfully conducting Nepal's first constituent assembly elections, witnessed the erosion of electoral integrity due to the increasing influence of big business on political parties, leading to a surge in corruption and the weakening of state agencies.\nDuring his term as home minister in the previous Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government that was toppled in mid-July, Narayan Kaji Shrestha, who is also senior vice-chair of the CPN (Maoist Centre), undertook some bold actions. He swung into action on high profile corruption cases such as Bhutanese refugee scam, Lalita Niwas land grab and cross-border gold smuggling. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal met him on Sunday to ask him of the performance of the new government, the saga around the arrest of Rastriya Swatantra Party chair Rabi Lamichhane.CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, as leader of the main opposition party, convened a joint meeting of opposition parties on Friday. It seems the opposition parties want to solidify their unity against the ruling coalition. What will be the opposition camp’s strategy to build pressure on the government?The government has not been effective in relief distribution, rehabilitation and reconstruction in the areas ravaged by the devastating floods and landslides in the last week of September. Therefore, we convened the meeting to draw the government’s attention to this sorry state of affairs. Second, right since the formation of this government [in mid-July], we suspected this coalition would play a negative role in terms of controlling corruption as the present coalition partners joined hands after being scared of the anti-corruption movement launched by our government [led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal]. It has become imperative to stop the government from doing wrong things and alert the people. Third, there are suspicions that the government is preparing to make it easier for dissident groups in various parties to split political parties by amending the Political Parties Act-2017 through an ordinance. Thus, we basically wanted to press the government to effectively carry out the post-disaster rehabilitation works and stop it from various wrongdoings.Are there specific issues on which the opposition camp wants to build pressure?Effective work on rehabilitation and reconstruction in the disaster-hit areas is our immediate demand. In the long-run, we want to raise the agenda of good governance because developing Nepal as a prosperous country and ensuring social justice should be our central mission. But this isn’t possible without first curbing rampant corruption. Unfortunately, the government is taking a negative approach in this connection.Could you give more specific details where the government went wrong in terms of corruption?To take the latest example, the CPN-UML, which is headed by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, recently accepted a donation of land worth tens of millions of rupees from Min Bahadur Gurung, owner of the country’s largest retail chain, Bhatbhateni Supermarket. The business tycoon has also announced plans to make a building for the party. During our tenure, the government filed a corruption case against him in Lalita Niwas land scam. He was arrested and later the Special Court convicted him of corruption. The land has already been retained as government property. Later, he moved the Supreme Court, where the case is sub judice. Prime Minister Oli had earlier vented his ire for arresting and filing a case against Gurung. We had suspected that he had done something wrong in collusion with Gurung. Oli’s acceptance of the property in the name of donation is unacceptable on political and moral grounds. It is against the good governance drive we launched. You know, we had initiated action in various major corruption scams during our tenure. There are reports that the government is trying to give clean chit to the accused instead of taking the process ahead. Thus the present coalition is working against good governance.In the meeting of the opposition coalition on Friday, Rastriya Swatantra Party chair Rabi Lamichhane, who was arrested on Saturday, sought support of other opposition parties [based on the information that he was being arrested] arguing that action against him was politically motivated. Will the opposition parties support him?Any case should be independently and fairly investigated. No culprit should be spared. At the same time, no political bias should reflect in the investigation. We can’t say anything about the government agencies’ investigation process. The meeting stressed on the same. It was during my tenure as home minister that the government initiated the investigation against Lamichhane after a supplementary case was registered at the Kaski District Police Office, accusing him of misusing deposits from a Kaski-based cooperative. Later, the parliament formed a special probe committee to investigate. Now the home ministry has taken action against him based on the recommendation of the same panel. We have to cooperate with the government in its investigation. The only thing we can say is that the investigation should be fair and independent. No political party can stand against the investigation itself. How do you see the protests by the RSP cadres following his arrest?They can raise their voice against the possibility of political revenge in the case and demand fair investigation. But they have to cooperate in the investigation and accept the findings. No one can obstruct the investigation just because someone is a politician. The government agencies can’t enforce rule of law if all political parties start protesting against investigations on individuals affiliated to them. A few of the RSP’s concerns are valid too. They argue that the government is working in a discriminatory way. For instance, there are reports with evidence showing involvement of some Nepali Congress and CPN-UML leaders in various cooperatives’ scams. They have asked why the government is not taking any action against them. This is a valid question. The authorities should take action against Congress and UML leaders as well to prove that the government is not discriminatory.Various high-profile corruption cases were prosecuted during your tenure as home minister. You understand if a case has been built on strong or weak grounds. From that perspective, what is your observation of Lamichhane’s case?Rabi ji himself has accepted a level of involvement in the case and said that he is ready to bear the financial liability of the cooperative money invested in the Gorkha Media Network [where he was managing director]. I can comment about the overall case only after the investigation is completed.The fact that over half-a-dozen home ministers since 1990 have been prosecuted in corruption cases shows powerful politicians are involved in corruption. Can this deep-rooted corruption be cleaned up?It is one of the major reasons hindering Nepal’s development. Corruption is promoted by those who are in key state positions. Therefore, we often say our state agencies are influenced by comprador capitalists and there is no investment in productive sectors that would create jobs. Our entire economic ecosystem of creating demand, production, supply and employment has failed. The nexus between powerful politicians, bureaucrats and a handful of business tycoons is promoting activities from where they get huge commissions, and where they get to exploit state coffers. Nepal can’t progress without breaking this nexus. We had taken strong actions in that direction. Unfortunately, the present coalition stopped that process and the comprador capitalists have yet again become active.You must have faced pressure from the political and other quarters when you took action against powerful leaders. Could you give some examples of such pressure?You know, though our party led the government, the other party [Nepali Congress] was the bigger force in the coalition government and actions were taken against the major leaders of the coalition partners. Even those who were affiliated to our party faced actions. So, definitely I faced immense political pressure. But no one could stop me as I was determined to complete my mission of good governance. But a section of people accuse you of sparing individuals close to top leaders and that some individuals were later freed on bail as the cases against them weren’t built as strongly.That is not the case. I pushed the cases despite huge political pressures. But the court later freed them on bail, where we have no role. The court has put some individuals behind bars while some were released. The role of the court is certainly a matter of research. You are right that people wonder why more powerful people aren’t brought under investigation even in big scams such as Bhutanese refugee scam and Lalita Niwas land grab. Media reports indicating powerful individuals’ involvement might be true. However, the government agencies can’t take action against anyone without sufficient evidence. Many have asked why two former prime ministers—Madhav Kumar Nepal and Baburam Bhattarai—were not prosecuted. The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) didn’t recommend action against them saying that the policy decisions made in Cabinet meetings don’t fall under its jurisdiction. And, it is still unclear which decisions made in the Cabinet are policy decisions and which aren’t.The secretaries who prepare proposals for Cabinet decisions are held responsible while the ministers who present the same proposals for a decision at the Cabinet meeting and the chief of the Cabinet are not held responsible. People have raised questions about this practice. I think this is a valid question and should be addressed properly. I also believe the ministers who present a proposal for a decision should be held responsible.Also questions were raised over the way the statements of the two prime ministers [Nepal and Bhattarai] were recorded at their homes and in the absence of a government attorney.I take this criticism positively. When I enquired about this episode, police told me that they did so because the CIAA had earlier recorded other former prime ministers at their homes and the police followed the same precedent. In the future, we should be careful. There is one crucial aspect in this case. The two prime ministers weren’t prosecuted in the Lalita Niwas land grab case. But the court has proved that the land deal was wrong. So, it has been recovered as government property. Thus, the decisions taken from the Cabinet meetings [chaired by Nepal and Bhattarai] were wrong. Don’t they need to do public self-criticism?Let’s move on to party politics. As in the past, leaders in your party rigorously discussed the issue of leadership change in Maoist Centre in recent meetings. But nothing happened. Do you see any chance of leadership change in the Maoist Centre?In our recent party meetings, we discussed whether the party’s transformation is more important or leadership change. We need a more unified, transformed and stronger party to implement our party’s agenda in national politics. This is more important. We discussed whether our leadership at present is obstructing this process. Our leadership is ready to work to transform the party, make the organisation stronger and then hand over the leadership. Our chair wants to take the party back to its past strength. We have taken his spirit positively. But this doesn’t mean that Prachanda [Dahal] is irreplaceable.Amid reports about reunification between various Maoist parties, party chairman Dahal and Nepal Communist Party General Secretary Netra Bikram Chand have both spoken on the need for such reunification. Is it happening soon?Our conclusion is that our party can take leadership in carrying out important national tasks. In principle we are in the right direction but the party can’t accomplish the tasks in its present form. So it needs to be made stronger. The ideological and moral grounds of our party have eroded. We have been distanced from downtrodden communities while party leaders have increased proximity with the well-off class. On the other hand, corruption has increased within the party. Therefore, we want to transform the party into a more revolutionary and stronger force. This should be the priority. But even after that, our party’s present strength alone will not suffice to accomplish important national tasks. So we have decided to join hands with more left and Maoist forces. Discussions with various groups for party unity and forging alliances are underway.Reports say the negotiation with the Chand-led party is more positive.The [Chand-led] party made two important decisions from a central committee meeting. They decided to go for party unity and take part in the next general elections. This is an important policy departure of the party. It has increased the possibility of party unity. But we haven’t reached any definite conclusion in this connection. Do you see any chances of forging a working alliance with new forces such as the RSP?The new forces raised an agenda [of good governance] and got good support from the public in elections. But people have already started complaining against them saying that they didn’t work as per their promises. They have started comparing them to traditional forces. The new leaders from whom people had expected a lot have already courted controversy. Having said that, we can’t brush aside the public disenchantment towards major political forces as well.The RSP champions an agenda which is quite different from what the Maoist Centre lobbies for. For instance, the policies the Maoist Centre and the RSP advocate on the federal system are opposite. In this context, can the two parties be long-term allies?The RSP has failed to be honest to the agenda it championed in the elections and to make its political ideology clear. And it has adopted a wrong policy on the federal system. Therefore, at present, we can’t say that we will have a long-term strategic collaboration. There is no reliable basis for that. As far as a working alliance is concerned, it can be with any party. For instance, we have diametrically opposed political viewpoints with the Rastriya Prajatantra Party. They want monarchy while we are strongly for the republic system. They are against federalism while we want a stronger federal system. But we can still forge a working alliance with them on certain agendas.Opposition parties seem quite scared of ordinance on Political Parties Act-2017. There is a need to end the legal void that exists after Congress-Maoist Centre government issued an ordinance three years ago. Is it based on the information about certain provisions that the government is implementing or because it is being brought by bypassing the parliament?It is true that there has been delay in reviving the provisions of the law that were inactivated after introduction of the ordinance at the time. We want that to be done through parliament. Now the government wants to make changes in it because it wants to meet certain vested political interests through it. There are suspicions that the present government leadership is working to split small parties and make the UML the largest in the House of Representatives.Why would Congress help the prime minister bring an ordinance that would make it smaller than the UML?That is why they might be at loggerheads over the issue. What I heard is that both the proposals to arrest Rabi Lamichhane and to issue the ordinance on the Political Parties Act-2017 were discussed in the same Cabinet meeting. The Congress reportedly pushed for the proposal on Lamichhane while the prime minister was for issuing the ordinance as well. It is certain that there is a tug of war between the two sides over the ordinance. \nCentral and eastern parts of Nepal witnessed devastating incidents of landslides and floods last week. At least 244 people were killed, while 19 are still missing. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Basanta Raj Adhikari, director at the Centre for Disaster Studies, Institute of Engineering at Tribhuvan University, to discuss how the country can be better prepared to manage the disasters and minimise damages.Recently we faced disastrous floods and landslides. How do you analyse the losses? Could the damages have been reduced with better preparation and timely response?To begin with, I want to make one thing clear. There is a fundamental difference between a disaster and hazard. Hazard is always natural but it becomes a disaster if there is human involvement. If there is a landslide in a jungle with no human activity, it is a hazard. If a landslide hit a human settlement and it required external involvement to restore the place, then it becomes a disaster. An earthquake is a hazard but it becomes a disaster when man-made structures kill people. As far as the losses from the recent floods are concerned, we could have minimised them with better preparation. For instance, Nakkhu was one of the worst hit areas in the Kathmandu Valley. The river there has drastically narrowed and a human settlement has been developed on the riverbanks in recent years. Human activities in rivers are natural as human civilisations took place on the banks of rivers. But it should be done without disrupting the natural flow of the water. We developed huge settlements encroaching the riverbanks. This invited huge losses. Such activities could have been avoided.As Nepal witnessed record-high rainfalls, were not these losses to be expected? It is true that the country witnessed record rainfalls this season, the highest in the past over five decades. Climate change has caused extreme weather events in recent years. But we can’t blame only natural factors. If you see the images of 2003, it clearly shows that the place where the MediCity Hospital now stands is clearly the floodplain of the Nakkhu river. If you go further downstream, you see a colony. This is how we have encroached riverbanks. We can encroach rivers but it should be done in a scientific way. What is scientific encroachment of rivers?We can model flooding based on the highest volume of water a river can carry. Based on such evidence, we can decide what kind of activities can and cannot be carried out on a riverbank. We can develop settlements but that should be based on scientific evidence and data. Another important concept we should follow is risk sensitive land use planning. Nepal government has already prepared land use maps of all the 753 local units that give vital information about a particular place such as the soil, land capability, risk layer, present land use map, zoning map and cadastral layer. But some people have stopped the authorities from implementing the maps as once they are passed, a land categorised as an agricultural area cannot be converted into commercial land. If that scheme is implemented, one can’t build a house in high flood land. Now the local authorities enforce only the building codes and that don’t include these provisions. That doesn’t inquire whether a building is being built on a riverbank or a landslide susceptible area. In developed countries, those who build in high flood risk areas have to pay more in insurance. Also, areas are categorised based on the chances of occurrence of landslides on the basis of soil type, rock type, geology, distance from a drainage or a road etcetera and structures built there are dealt with accordingly. We are witnessing extreme weather events. In this context, what should we do to prevent more loss in the days ahead?We require an engineering paradigm shift in building infrastructures. The extreme weather patterns have made the data we used to refer to in the past while building infrastructures irrelevant. The data on water levels that were referred to while making a bridge in a river now need to be updated as water levels in our rivers have been rising in recent years. The existing infrastructures can’t withstand that volume of water. We witnessed record rainfalls last week. This can be a reference data for some years. Also, the sedimentation pattern has changed because of human settlements built upstream.Second, we have a generalised rule of building roads across the country. The impact of 200 millilitres of rainfall in Pokhara and rainfall of the same volume in Jhapa is different. As Pokhara experiences rains on a regular basis, the soil in the area can withstand it because it has been weathered by regular rain but the same volume of rainfall can cause more losses in Jhapa because of weak soil there. We thus have to consider the strength of soil while building a structure in a particular place.There is a single road construction method across the country, whether the place is in a high himalayan range, Mahabharat, Shivalik hills or plains. We have to make specific rules for specific places based on the geological and soil structures. The parameters of road construction should be redefined. We are improving the weather forecasting system but now we also need impact-based forecasting to inform the public not only about the volume of likely rainfall but also its likely impact.Where are the problems in our disaster response approach?The Natural Calamity (Relief) Act, 1982 was guided by a fatalistic approach as it saw natural hazards as destined by fate. Then came Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act, 2017. This change in law is in fact a paradigm shift in disaster management in Nepal. The new law’s perspective is progressive. The new Act changed us from response-centric to preparedness-centric. Legally, we are on a progressive path. But we lag in implementation. We also need to upgrade our skills in handling the situation. Our constitution as well as laws have entrusted local units with the responsibility of handling disaster incidents on their own. The government should make people at the local level aware, and equip and train them for the purpose.Training on some important procedures such as the INSARAG preparedness and response guidelines can be quite effective. Such training and other activities aimed at helping local units to handle disaster incidents should be conducted at the ward levels. “Understanding risk” is an important aspect in disaster management. So common people should be sensitised to the consequences of disaster incidents. You can see people collecting timber from flooded rivers, taking selfies on riverbanks and gathering on a bridge above a roaring river. People at all local wards need to be well-equipped. Those who were swept away at Nakkhu could have been saved if the security personnel and other people there had at least motorboats and life jackets. Our rescue workers now lack even such basic things.Settlements in Nepal’s mountainous and hill areas are located in equally risky zones. What should be done to safeguard them?The mountains in our region are taken as young and the Himalayan range is in the building process. It is also called an active mountain belt. Therefore, we experience frequent earthquakes. Earthquakes cause geomorphological changes. A large number of settlements in Nepal’s hills sit on the debris of old landslides that might have occurred long back. People there should be made aware of the risk and these places be identified. Engineering measures should be taken to make them safe. Scattered populations mainly in the highlands need to be integrated in concentrated settlements.What is the latest status of glaciers and glacial lakes in our mountains?The pace of glacial melting is rising alarmingly because of rising temperature. Earlier, we took only big glacial lakes as threats and gave them more attention but recent incidents showed that even smaller ones pose a threat. The incident of the Thame glacial lake outburst in August showed how the outburst of even a small glacial lake could have a cascading effect. Likewise, the deposits of landslides being piled above 3,000 metres are another serious challenge. Such sediment deposition is increasing in the mountains while there is a huge population downstream. The frequency of cascading hazards has increased, emerging as a major challenge. A landslide blocks a river and when the river breaches the structure built of debris, it causes devastating losses downstream.How can we scientifically prove that the hazards we are seeing were the result of climate change?There has to be scientific evidence to make the link. For instance, the Thame glacial outburst was clearly a climate change-induced hazard as it did not involve human activities. The treeline and snowline are shifting upwards in our mountains. There were no mosquitoes in Mustang until some years ago. Now mosquitos are widespread in the district as temperature there has significantly increased. The crop pattern has changed drastically. Thus we have a number of scientific evidence to show clear signs of climate change in this part of the world. What the government should now do is properly document these climate change-induced incidents following internationally-accepted methods and present them at relevant UN bodies. \nNepal’s economy that has been facing one after another setbacks since the 2015 earthquake has been struggling to bounce back. Last week, two international agencies—the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB)—announced that Nepal’s economy was poised to improve in the upcoming fiscal year. In this context, the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Nara Bahadur Thapa, former executive director of the research department of Nepal Rastra Bank, to discuss the current state of the national economy. The ADB, in its report last week, anticipated Nepal’s economy to grow by 4.9 percent this fiscal. A few days earlier, a visiting IMF team also painted an improving picture of Nepal’s economy. How do you see these projections?Nepal’s economic growth in the past 2-3 years has remained below 5 percent. But successive governments in their fiscal budgets have been setting the target of 6 to 7 percent growth. Also, the budget this year has aimed for 6 percent growth. In the meantime, two donor agencies have painted an improving picture of our economy. The ADB has anticipated 4.9 percent growth. Also, the IMF’s team that visited Nepal on a fact finding mission has projected better prospects. They expected better yield from the agriculture sector as Nepal is witnessing more rains. Last year, the growth of agriculture was 3 percent. Now they expect the sector may grow by 3.5 to 4 percent and that may lift overall growth. They have cited improvement in tourism and increased energy export as other bases. Based on these grounds, the ADB has projected 4.9 percent economic growth. But even the target of 5 percent growth looks ambitious if you analyse economic data available as of now and the steps taken by government agencies. We have witnessed more rain but that doesn’t always do us good. More rain in the late monsoon often damages paddy at the time of harvest. Second, the heavy monsoon has caused huge losses in our infrastructure such as roads and bridges that are vital to keep the daily lives and trade running. This may impact potential economic growth as some vital highways and roads have been badly damaged. These factors may pose a challenge in achieving the targets set by the government and donor agencies. Another important factor is that the ratio of capital formation to GDP [gross domestic product] is consistently decreasing. It was 33.8 in the fiscal year 2018-19, it decreased to 30.5 in 2019-20, to 29.3 in 2020-21, 29.0 in 2021-22, 25.1 in 2022-23 and 24.5 in 2023-24. How can we expect economic growth when capital formation keeps decreasing. We can’t achieve 6 percent growth without first improving the situation of capital formation. Capital formation in the private sector is on a decline and the government hasn’t been able to boost it. On the other hand, capital expenditure was lower in the past fiscal year in comparison to the previous fiscal. There is no strong sign of increasing capital formation even in the coming year. This is because the government has failed to collect revenue as per its own target. The revenue collection ratio is falling. It has come down to 18 percent of GDP, from 22 percent not so long ago. With this, the government’s funding capacity is continuously declining. It has failed even to fulfil its own duties. For instance, it hasn’t been able to pay health insurance bills and or the contractors. Similarly, credit offtake from private banks to the private sector has not increased from 6 percent. It used to be around 15-16 percent. Also, no substantive initiatives have been taken to improve productivity. For this, government agencies have to cut red tape. The private sector isn’t optimistic. We are talking a lot but not working seriously to lay a strong ground for growth.What are the signs that private investors are pessimistic?There is enough liquidity in the banks, and the interest rate is decreasing, but the private sector is not borrowing. Bankers say there is no demand from the sector. This indicates pessimism. None of the big business houses have launched any big projects in recent times. The government talks a lot about the energy sector but it is not doing power purchase agreements (PPAs) with hydropower project developers. We aren’t doing enough to realise the goal of exporting 10,000MW electricity to India. This shows no serious effort is being made to initiate reforms. The capital market has required some urgent reforms. But the government hasn’t appointed office bearers in the regulatory body for the past seven months. The government hasn’t given permission to issue IPOs and FPOs. Hence, the government is keeping two important sectors—energy and capital market—on hold. All these trends and activities suggest it will be a challenge to achieve even moderate economic growth.You pointed to the policy hurdles but the multilateral agencies have hailed the government for policy reforms. The IMF in its statement has welcomed recent amendments to various laws and the ADB has welcomed “the cautiously accommodative monetary policy”. Don’t these statements reflect reality?While making their positions public, the international agencies follow certain norms and criteria. First, they take macro pictures such as the government’s commitments. They take the pledges made by the government in the investment summit seriously. They think the commitments will be implemented. Second, they don’t want to irk the host country by presenting a bleak picture because they are diplomats. They point out possible pitfalls during bilateral and table talks but present themselves diplomatically while making their official statements public.Remittance, tourism and energy export are taken as major bases for economic growth but all three depend on external factors. How reliable can the projection be?Without trading and increasing exports, we can’t progress economically. We need to export to increase production and create jobs. Export is an engine of economic growth. Anyhow, we must increase exports. About your query, the government should tackle such things by strengthening relations with the countries concerned and devise policies and strategies accordingly.Our economy is increasingly dependent on remittance. How risky is it in the long run?Remittance has become a boon for our economy. It has played a tremendous role in poverty reduction. The first Nepal Living Standard Survey (NLSS) conducted by the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS)—now the National Statistics Office—in 1995-96 showed 42 percent Nepali population living below the poverty line. The latest [fourth] living standard survey has shown the poverty level at 20 percent. It wouldn’t be possible without remittance. Therefore, we can’t undermine the role of remittance in this social transformation. Were not the government’s plans and policies responsible for this achievement?The government role would not have been enough. What government policies have created jobs in Nepal? Are there any schemes worth mentioning? The industrialisation hasn’t increased. It is the industrial sector that creates jobs but the share of the manufacturing sector has come down to 4.87 percent in total GDP. Some years ago, it was nearly 9-10 percent. It shows our economy is being deindustrialised. How can we reduce poverty without providing jobs to the youths? Thus, foreign employment played a vital role in poverty reduction. Second is the role of remittance in maintaining foreign exchange reserves, which is essential to buy things from abroad. We have sufficient foreign exchange reserves because of remittance.Information Technology is now projected as a promising sector in creating jobs and transforming Nepal’s economy. How realistic is this expectation?Four fields can be taken as promising sectors in Nepal—agriculture, tourism, IT and hydropower. The IT sector certainly has a bright future. As our country is land-locked, we have additional challenges in merchandise exports and we can’t be competitive. The IT sector won’t have that barrier so it can be competitive in the international market. But for that the government has to formulate IT-friendly policies. For instance, if a Kathmandu-based Nepali firm wants to sell services in the US, Europe or any other international market, they need liaison offices in those countries. Otherwise, they can’t be competitive and grow. But the government doesn’t provide foreign exchange for them to expand their business abroad.Without this policy reform, Nepalis can’t compete with IT companies from other countries. Similarly, foreign companies need to come and work here so that Nepali youths can learn from them. Foreign banks came to Nepal and Nepali bankers learned. Now Nepali banks are doing good. But our policies aren’t favourable for foreigners interested in setting up IT firms. Also, well-trained IT workers are in shortage. We are progressing but we have to put in extra effort to make transformative changes in this sector.The cooperatives’ scam has emerged as a serious issue. What impact may it cause in the national economy if it’s not resolved soon?The cooperative sector played a vital role in creating financial inclusion in our economy by making 7.3 million people its members. Those who couldn’t do their regular transactions with banks were engaged with cooperatives. If that sector collapses, our state of financial inclusion will decline too. Second, they were major financiers for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME). Cooperatives are directly linked to entrepreneurship through MSMEs. They played a role in making interest rates of banks more competitive as well as banks and financial institutions were under pressure by the interest rates offered by cooperatives. Now they won’t feel the pressure.In this context, many people may resort to informal transactions. According to the 16th periodic plan, nearly 50 percent of Nepal’s economy is informal. We are under pressure to reduce the portion of the informal economy. But the crisis in the cooperative sector may increase the informal economy as those who were involved in cooperatives, which is a formal sector, are likely to do informal transactions with traders or other individuals.Cooperatives are not well regulated and there are anomalies but they are registered in a government agency, pay taxes, have offices and a record system. They brought people in far-flung villages under a formal channel. If the depositors resort to individual transactions, their money will be unsafe. The constitution accepted them as one of the three pillars—along with the government and the private sector—of the country’s economy. The sector expanded its network where there were no economic activities from the government and private sectors. For instance, the government was providing certain services such as distributing fertilisers, crop seeds, sugar through cooperatives. People will now be deprived of these services. Also, the commercial banks might face complications due to the domino effect of the cooperative scam. For instance, if the government seizes the land put up by a cooperative as a collateral in a bank and sells it to return the deposits, the bank might be in trouble.It is also said that cooperatives were becoming platforms for money laundering. How serious was the problem?Cooperatives didn’t seek a source of money from the depositors while accepting big deposits. They weren’t affiliated to the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of the central bank and the Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT). Therefore, there is a problem of money laundering. It can be resolved when they get affiliated with the FIU.What initiatives should be taken to address the problems seen in the cooperative sector?A powerful regulatory authority should be established without delay. The authority should work as a dedicated agency to clear the mess. Then, AML/CFT provisions should be implemented, a credit information centre should be set up and a debt recovery tribunal formed, and deposits guaranteed. The concept of self-regulation isn’t enough. These financial infrastructures are essential. \nThe parliamentary special probe committee formed to investigate cooperatives scam submitted its report last week. The government has already started implementing the report. In this context, Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with the committee chair Surya Thapa for more insights on the probe’s findings and the anomalies in the cooperative sector they saw during the investigation.After your committee submitted the report on cooperatives scam, people have interpreted its findings in different ways. Why the confusion?Our committee prepared, finalised and endorsed the report unanimously. No member registered any dissent. This is an important point. However, people have interpreted its findings a bit differently. The supporters of [Rastriya Swatantra Party chair] Rabi Lamichhane have tried to make it appear like the report has given him a clean chit. They have selectively taken a certain portion of the report which states that Lamichhane’s involvement couldn’t be formally established in the process of transferring funds from cooperatives to the Gorkha Media Network. But a huge amount of money has been provided to the Gorkha Media Network from various cooperatives against the Cooperative Act 2017, which prohibits investment of cooperative deposits to any company. It is seen that Lamichhane is directly involved in spending the funds collected from the cooperatives. Based on that, we have found chair of the media company Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai, the then managing director Rabi Lamichhane, directors Chhabilal Joshi and Kumar Ramtel directly responsible in the misuse of cooperative funds and have asked the government to take action against them as per the existing laws. The aforementioned two aspects are inextricably linked. We didn’t find any evidence of transfer of cooperative funds to Lamichhane’s personal bank account. It is sent to the bank account of the Gorkha Media Network. The KYC form of the Global IME Bank shows that Lamichhane is one of the three holders of the joint account. Any one of the three can issue cheques from the account. The funds invested as loan in the Gorkha Media Network have been transferred to the joint bank account, from where Lamichhane has released money by signing cheques. This is how Lamichhane is directly involved in embezzlement of the cooperative funds. Many argue that as per the cooperative law only those who release money from the cooperatives are held responsible but not those who spend it after it is received at the company. Is that the case?The Cooperative Act 2017 prohibits releasing any loan to a company. But it is sent to the company, where Lamichhane is an owner with 15 percent share and a managing director. And, the money is misused there. An informal statement of GB Rai shows Rs1.20 billion of cooperative deposits has been invested in the media company while our financial analysis shows the amount is Rs654 million. Evidence shows Rs220 million has been directly sent to the media company’s bank account. Depositors have been deprived of their money. Other staff working at the company aren’t responsible but the owners are. They could be charged with cooperative fraud under the Cooperative Act, fraud and duping under the National Penal Code, organised crime cases under the Organised Crime Prevention Act, and money laundering cases under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. Some individuals involved with various cooperatives including Roshni Gurung of a Butwal-based cooperative told the committee that they deposited millions of rupees in the bank account of a person named Rabi Lamichhane. Kumar Ramtel said the person named Rabi Lamichhane is none other than the Rastriya Swatantra Party chair. Still, the committee couldn’t establish the link. What is the complication?The flow of the money shows the connection but documents to link the transactions are not available. We didn’t find documents with Lamichhane’s signatures and fingerprints that needed to be submitted to get a loan. All the seven cooperatives run by GB Rai were releasing loans without following due procedure. But we have successfully traced the flow of the money. The loan amount created in the name of Rabi Lamichhane in Butwal and deposited by Roshni Gurung had reached the Gorkha Media Network’s bank account which was jointly operated by GB Rai, Rabi Lamichhane and Chhabilal Joshi. This is an established fact. The committee didn’t find any document showing the flow of cooperative money to his personal account. But that alone is insufficient to give him a clean chit as a huge sum has been sent to the media company’s bank account jointly run by three people including Lamichhane. Another sum from the Supreme Cooperative has been deposited to the bank account of Gorkha Media Network. The bank voucher shows Roshni Gurung/Rabi Lamichhane as depositors. The amount also goes to the same joint account.Now the government has forwarded the report to the investigation agencies. Do you think the agencies can unearth the missing documents?Our committee worked in a different way to regular House committees. We followed methods of investigation just like the police investigation agencies and government’s prosecution agencies do. We recorded the suspects’ statements, took their fingerprints, and got the signatures to authenticate their statements. I believe this is a new practice by a Nepali parliamentary committee. Sufficient evidence has already been gathered in the past as well. While carrying out this task and preparing the 1,124-page document, we have followed the norms and procedures of an investigation body.During the interrogation, many suspects told the committee that they knew nothing and shifted the responsibility to GB Rai, who is on the run. Those from seven cooperatives–Hamro Nayakrishi Multipurpose Cooperatives; Swarnalaxmi; Supreme; Suryadarshan; Sahara; Samanata and Sano Paila and the officials from Gorkha Media Network gave such answers. Their common answer is, “I don’t know about this, GB Rai does.” Many of them might have been trying to evade their responsibility by blaming Rai. The government has failed to produce Rai. Won’t this investigation be incomplete in his absence?Based on its facts and evidence, the investigation report is complete. Yes, 29 suspects including GB Rai are at large. They are believed to be staying abroad. Their statements have not been recorded. But that doesn’t make the investigation incomplete. We have accessed the database of Gorkha Media Network and other cooperative organisations, collected important documents and analysed them. There is no confusion about the money embezzled in the scam. We have determined a total of Rs2.58 billion from various cooperatives has been misused by investing in several organisations including the Gorkha Media Network, Nature Nest, Nature Herbs, Gorkha Group of Investment, Gorkha Ayurved Company—49 people were responsible for these investments, including GB Rai. Of that, Rs654 million has been invested in Gorkha Media Network. A total of Rs8 billion has been embezzled in the seven cooperatives where Rai is involved. So the investigation is complete. During the interrogation, some office bearers of cooperatives claimed they had no role in the transactions as they were dummy officials and GB Rai and some individuals Rai trusted did everything. How convincing is that?The practice of creating dummy officials, fake documents, false marriages and divorces etcetera is rampant in the cooperative sector. In the seven cooperatives GB Rai is at the centre. He has at least one key person in each of these seven cooperatives as chair or manager and carries out everything through them. In some of them, the chairpersons know nothing. The cooperatives don’t follow any norms, rules and regulations of cooperatives. They work just on the basis of orders they get from Rai or his trusted individuals over the phone. Rai gets advice from a California-based individual named Gyan Bahadur Bamjan. The Cooperative Act prohibits an individual from being a member of more than one cooperative but Rai is involved in at least seven cooperatives as a chair, secretary, vice-chair or patron.The government has decided to implement the report. How should the state agencies work to bring good results?The government should immediately initiate action against four persons—Rabi Lamichhane, GB Rai, Chhabilal Joshi and Kumar Ramtel—as the report has found them responsible for misusing cooperative funds. We have also determined the roles and responsibilities of around 1,000 individuals who were chair, vice-chairs, secretaries, treasurers, account chiefs or others who in decision making roles in 40 cooperatives we were tasked to investigate. They should be brought under investigation and their properties should be seized so as to create an environment to return the depositors’ money.Different arrangements need to be made about those who are in judicial custody. They should be released, their all documents including passports seized and they should be kept under surveillance and allowed to take initiatives to return the depositors’ money. The government, while unveiling the fiscal budget, had announced to take initiatives to return deposits upto Rs500,000 by keeping cooperatives’ assets as collateral. This process should be expedited. Likewise, the government should set up an all-powerful regulatory authority. At present, all the 753 local governments, seven provincial governments and the federal government have the regulatory role. That is pointless. Now a strong dedicated regulatory authority should be formed. The Crisis-ridden Cooperatives Management Committee is there but it should be made more effective by giving it greater executive powers. When a cooperative is in crisis, the regulatory body should take over its management and fix the crisis just like Nepal Rastra Bank does in the banking sector.What patterns of anomalies did you find in the cooperatives?The fundamental idea of a cooperative is to run by its own members based on self-regulation. But a few board members were found to be using all the authority and misusing the funds while members were unaware about the affairs in the organisations. The board members use most of the resources for their relatives and other closed ones. Annual meetings are organised as picnics and wedding parties. In some cases, annual meetings are fake, audit reports, auditors and signatures, all are fake.In the course of preparing the committee report, I have coined terms like ‘cooperative divorce’ and ‘cooperative marriage’. Divorce and marriage documents are prepared based on the fortune of the cooperatives. There was misappropriation of Rs120 million in a cooperative, where Jyoti Gurung was manager, in 2075 BS. Dhan Raj Gurung, who is Nepali Congress Vice-president, divorced his wife Jyoti in 2076 BS. But, in 2077, Dhan Raj presented himself as a guarantor of a loan to Jyoti. Again in 2080, both of them jointly paid back a loan of Rs9.1 million. This is a bit of a trend in the cooperative sector.Do you think we need to reconsider the basic idea of cooperatives as self-regulated organisations?In the report, we haven’t questioned its principle, need and importance. Cooperative sector is vital for our economy. But the concept of self-regulation as stated in the Cooperative Act 2017 has failed. Now, this sector should be overseen by a strong regulatory body. Still, the idea of self-regulation can be given continuity as the members should be allowed to run the cooperatives on their own but their activities should be strictly regulated by a powerful authority. Moreover, the cooperatives that do big transactions should be regulated by the central bank.Why did the present regulatory bodies fail?There were over 50 lawmakers who proudly identified themselves as office bearers of certain cooperatives. They over-emphasised self-regulation and undermined the role of regulatory bodies. Individuals like GB Rai and other fraudsters benefited from that. Therefore, we recommended stringent laws and a stronger regulatory authority. \nThe Meteorological Forecasting Division said on Wednesday that Nepal’s hilly areas will experience partly cloudy skies, while the rest of the country is expected to have mostly fair weather.Light rain, accompanied by thunder and lightning, is likely in isolated areas of Koshi and Gandaki provinces. By tonight, conditions are expected to remain partly cloudy in the hilly regions, while other areas will continue to see clear skies.The division attributed these weather patterns to the influence of western and local winds across the country.On Tuesday, Nepalgunj recorded the highest temperature at 33.7°C, Jomsom observed the lowest at 7.5°C, and Lumle received the highest rainfall at 62.9 mm. \nOn Tuesday, Koshi Province and the hilly regions will experience partly to generally cloudy skies, with the rest of the country expected to be partly cloudy to mainly fair.Light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is likely in a few areas of Koshi Province and at isolated locations in the hilly areas of Bagmati and Sudurpaschim provinces. Rain and thunderstorms are also possible in isolated hilly areas across other provinces.Tonight, partly cloudy skies are expected in the hilly regions, while other areas will remain partly cloudy to mainly fair. Light rain with thunder and lightning may occur in isolated areas of the hilly regions in Bagmati and Gandaki provinces.The Meteorological Forecasting Division attributed these conditions to the influence of westerly and local winds across the country. \nLight to moderate rainfall that occurred briefly on Sunday and again on Monday brought a chill to the Kathmandu Valley and several parts of the country. The Meteorological Forecasting Division under the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology said light to moderate rainfall is expected on Tuesday as well in most of the hilly and mountainous regions.“Light to moderate rainfall has occurred in hilly and mountainous areas of Koshi, Bagmati, Gandaki Provinces and some places of Karnali and Sudurpaschim Provinces have also witnessed rainfall on Monday,” said Pratibha Manandhar, a senior meteorologist at the Meteorological Forecasting Division. “Some places of Tarai region of Lumbini Province also witnessed rainfall. Temperature will decline further in the coming days as rainfall will bring chilly weather.”The Met Office attributes the rainfall and weather disturbances to westerly winds, local weather systems and effects of low pressure areas formed around West Bengal of India. There are chances of light snowfall in a few places of the high hilly and mountainous region of the country on Sunday night, according to the Met Office. Hilly areas of the country will witness general to partly cloudy conditions and the rest of the places will witness partial cloudy conditions.“We will see sunlight on Wednesday,” said Manandhar. “Weather will improve Wednesday onwards.”According to met Office, Kathmandu Valley recorded 6.1 mm rainfall in 4 hours on Monday. Minimum temperature of the Valley recorded 16.2 degree Celsius. Many people including office goers were soaked and those returning to Kathmandu Valley and in other destinations across the country after celebrating Tihar were affected due to disturbances in domestic flights. Farmers preparing to harvest rice, millet and other crops have also been affected due to rain.Meanwhile the rainfall has helped reduce air pollution in many places including the capital city, which had worsened of late.Nepal is one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to the climate crisis and has witnessed extreme weather events over the past decade and a half.Evidence suggests that Nepal's maximum temperature is rising at a greater rate (0.056 degrees Celsius per year) than the global average of 0.03 degrees Celsius per year.Experts say extreme weather events—excess rainfall in a short period, continuous rains for several days after the monsoon, dry spells, droughts, below-average precipitation, and above-normal winter temperatures—have become more frequent in Nepal.Evidence suggests that maximum temperatures in Nepal are rising faster, at 0.056 degrees Celsius a year, compared to the annual global average rise of 0.03 degrees Celsius. \nThe country will experience partly to generally cloudy skies in the hilly areas on Monday, while the rest of the country will remain partly cloudy to mostly clear. Light to moderate rain is expected in the hilly regions of Bagmati and Gandaki provinces, with a few showers likely in other hilly regions and isolated parts of the Terai.There is a chance of light snowfall in some high hilly and mountainous areas.Tonight, hilly areas in Koshi, Bagmati, and Gandaki provinces are forecasted to remain partly to generally cloudy with light to moderate rain in some areas. The high hilly and mountainous regions of these provinces may experience light snowfall.According to the Meteorological Forecasting Division, western and local winds, along with a low-pressure system over West Bengal, are partially influencing weather conditions across the country.On Sunday, Janakpur recorded the highest temperature at 33.4°C, while Jiri had the lowest at 12.0°C. Kathmandu received the highest rainfall with 6.1 mm. \n\nBe elaborative as possible. I need more text. Text only no title or headings.

Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nTwo ruling parties have formed a three-tier political mechanism—at the centre, in the provinces and in the districts—in order to facilitate the government of the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML at the centre and to resolve any disputes at the provincial and district levels.Prime Minister and UML chair KP Sharma Oli and Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba will head the mechanism, according to a statement issued by the secretariat of the newly announced body on Wednesday. The first meeting of the mechanism was held on Tuesday. At the central level, they formed an eight-member team with four members from each party. Among them are the parties’ office bearers and ministers in the Oli Cabinet. However, in the provinces and districts, each party will have three representatives in the task force.The decision to form the joint mechanism is aimed at minimising the differences between the two parties, supporting the spirit of government formation agreed in mid-July when the parties came together, according to ruling party leaders.The development comes at a time when the popularity of the Oli government is dipping as it fails to revive the ailing economy, unlike what was promised in mid-July. The mechanism is also tasked with removing the obstacles to the two parties’ coalition so that it continues to govern until the elections in 2027. Formation of the mechanisms at provincial and district levels are said to be in the final stage.Vice-president Purna Bahadur Khadka, General Secretary Gagan Thapa, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba and Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak are Congress members in the task force while UML senior vice-chairman Ishwar Pokhrel, General Secretary Shankar Pokhrel, Finance Minister Bishnu Paudel and deputy general secretary Bishnu Rimal are representing Oli.The decision was made on October 31, Rimal told the Post. The objectives of the mechanism are to support and facilitate the works of the three-tier government.Representatives from the two parties will lead the mechanism by turns. Khadka of the Congress will coordinate the meetings for a month from November 5. At the provincial level, Congress provincial party chief, incumbent chief minister or the parliamentary party leader (in case the party is not leading the provincial government) and the senior member of the provincial Cabinet will be members of the task force.From the UML, provincial party chair, provincial in-charge and parliamentary party leader will be members of the task force, said Rimal. At the district level, Congress party president and two office bearers will be the members.The UML district in-charge, party chair and secretary will be represented in the task force, according to Rimal.The political mechanism also announced the visit of Prime Minister Oli to China scheduled for December 2-6. But the government is yet to make a formal announcement of the visit. At the invitation of Chinese Premier Li Qiang, prime minister Oli is paying an official visit to China in December. As per the instructions of Prime Minister Oli and Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana will coordinate the visit. The task force will lay the groundwork for the visit , the statement added. Rana has already cancelled her scheduled trip to Baku, Azerbaijan where she was to attend the 2024 United Nations Climate Change Conference. President Ramchandra Paudel is leading the Nepali delegation in the UN climate change conference. The main objective of the three-tire mechanism is to assist and support the federal, provincial and local governments, said Rimal. The provincial and district level mechanisms will resolve disputes related to government functioning, he added. “The main purpose of the mechanisms is to convince people that the government will deliver and address their needs. The mechanism will help restore trust and hope and will solidify the Congress-UML alliance,” added Rimal.Leaders said that there is good working relations between the two parties at all three levels.“This government will complete its full term. The current political Oli-Deuba partnership is doing well as there is a high level of mutual trust,” said Rimal. He said the government would stay intact so long as the trust between Oli and Deuba remains intact and so long as the UML remains a united party. \nPolitical parties have expedited their preparations for the by-elections slated for next month in various local units.The by-elections will be held on December 1 for various positions that went vacant due to various reasons after the local elections in 2022.As the Election Commission has fixed November 18 for filing the candidacy, parties are busy selecting their candidates for the 44 vacant seats ranging from the chief of the district coordination committees to the ward chairpersons.The voters from different local units will vote to elect two chiefs of the district coordination committees, chairpersons of two rural municipalities, four vice-chairs, one mayor, one deputy mayor and chairs of 34 wards. Votes will also be cast to elect chiefs of the district coordination committees in Okhaldhunga and Kailali, the mayor of Kirtipur Municipality in Kathmandu, and the deputy mayor of Nalagad Municipality in Jajarkot.Similarly, the elections will be held to elect chairpersons of Gramthan Rural Municipality in Morang and Mahabu Rural Municipality in Dailekh, and the vice-chairs of Gaurishankar Rural Municipality in Dolakha, Sarkegad Rural Municipality in Humla and Swamikartik Khapar Rural Municipality in Bajura.Additionally, elections will take place to elect ward chair positions in various local units including in the Kathmandu Metropolitan City and Kirtipur Municipality.The Local Level Election Act, 2016 envisions by-elections to fill vacant positions such as district coordination committee heads, vice-heads, rural municipality chairs, vice-chairs, mayors, deputy mayors, and ward chairs if their term has not expired and has more than a year left with for their term. The representatives in all the vacant positions were elected on May 13, 2022 with just half of their terms completed so far.Suman Ghimire, information officer at the commission, said the nominations can be filed during the office hours on November 17 and the list of candidates will be published by 6 pm the same day.Anyone who has an objection to the candidacy of any contestant can lodge the complaint the next day. Similarly, candidates will be allowed to withdraw their candidacies, if they wish so, by 1 pm on October 20.The final list of the candidates from all the vacant positions will be published the same day while the election symbols too will be allotted between 3 pm to 5 pm on the day.“Twenty-five parties have been registered in the commission to compete in the by-polls,” said Ghimire.According to the constitutional poll management body, the mayoral and deputy mayoral candidates can spend a maximum of Rs450,000, rural municipality chairs and vice-chairs are allowed to spend up to Rs350,000 while the aspirants for the district coordination committee chief and deputy can spend up to Rs50,000.Rs300,000 is the maximum amount the candidates for metropolitan city ward chairs can spend but the ceiling is Rs200,000 and Rs150,000 for the ward chairpersons of the municipality and rural municipality, respectively.The main opposition CPN (Maoist Centre) is ahead of other major parties in candidate selection. It has decided to field Shivsharan Maharjan, a professor by profession, for the vacant mayor's position in Kirtipur Municipality. It has picked Nimleki Sherpa for the vice-chairperson position in Gaurishankar Rural Municipality of Dolakha. The third largest party has also finalised its candidates for the ward chairpersons in most of the local units where the by-polls are going to take place.The ruling CPN-UML has picked the contenders for by-elections in the local units from Kathmandu but is yet to decide for other parts. Surendra Manandhar, a UML central committee member, is the party’s mayoral candidate in Kirtipur. Laxmi Ratna Tuladhar will contest for chairperson of ward 16 of the Kathmandu Metropolis from the UML.Rajendra Gautam, publicity department chief of the second largest party, said all the party’s candidates will be finalised within a couple of days.The Nepali Congress, on the other hand, has already received lists of the probable candidates from the respective local units but is yet to finalise the names. The Rastriya Swatantra Party, which came into existence after the 2022’s local elections, is also preparing to contest the by-polls this time.All the parties, including those who had contested earlier polls forming pre-poll alliances, have announced they’d contest the upcoming elections independently. \nKaski residents have started redeveloping the Krapu Kwholasothar trail, a circuit trek of religious and historical significance that remains unexplored.Kwhlosothar, located 3,283 metres above sea level, is in the southern part of Annapurna and Lamjung. It can be reached through Tangting, Sikles, Kori and Yangjakot of Kaski and Pasgaun, Bhujung, and Ghanpokhari of Lamjung.The shortest route is from Tangting.Locals say it's not just an ordinary trekking trail for it connects Kwholasothar, an ancient village believed to be Nepal's first Gurung or Tamu settlement, with ruins of an ancient town over 1500-1200 years old.Until half a decade ago, northern Kaski and Lamjung locals used this route to bring salt from Tibet.A decade ago, a joint research team from Cambridge University of the UK and the Central Department of Geology, Tribhuvan University, studied the artefacts in Kwhlosothar.Bed Bahadur Gurung, a Gandaki provincial assembly member and former chairman of Madi rural municipality, said the trail has many historical and archaeological sites for pilgrimages for the Tamu [Gurung] people and could be an important historical attraction for Nepali and foreign trekkers.Kwhlosothar or Kohla Sothar is divided into three villages—lower, middle and upper. ‘Sothar’, in the Gurung language, means three villages. Locals and researchers say Kohla Sonthar resembles the 15th-century Inca ruins of Machu Pichu in Peru. For a long time, people have been demanding the area be declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.“There are many historical artefacts, including houses and palaces, in these three villages,” said Gurung.There are caves after walking two hours more from Kwhlosothar at the height 3,800. ‘The cave is known as ‘Chamsyo Nagra.’Gurung remembers when his father brought salt via Tangting of Kwhlosothar-Namun Bhanjyang-Larke Pass-Tibet route five decades ago.When the road from Pokhara-Butwal opened, the people of Kwhlosothar stopped going along the mountainous route.No human settlement exists above Tangting, but many sheep and buffalo herders can be found there.Gurung said that before the Annapurna Conservation Area Project was established in 1985, foreign trekkers used to go for camping treks. However, since the project didn’t include the Kwhlosothar, trekkers stopped hiking in the area and remained isolated.The project promoted Manang, Lamjung, Thorong Pass, Mustanf, Myagfi and Annapurna Base Camp, Ghandruk-Ghorepani, but Kwhlosothar remained in the shadows.In Tony Hagen's book Building Bridges to the Third World: Memories of Nepal 1950-1992, the Swiss geologist mentions his travel experience to Namun Bhanjyang, from the base of Machapuchhre to Sikles, Madi River, and Krupudanda.The trail was named the ‘Tony Hagen Trail’ after Bed Bahadur Gurung became the chairman of the Madi rural municipality to promote it.“This trail needs to be redefined to allow people to know the historical importance of the place. The provincial and local governments and tourism entrepreneurs of Lamjung, Manang, and Kaski all need to play an equal role in promoting the area,” said Gurung.The Ministry of Industry, Tourism, Forest and Environment of Gandaki Province, Nepal Tourism Board office in Pokhara have been allocating a budget to promote trails in Madi in Kaski, Kwhlosothar of Lamjung and Chame of Manang. But on the promotional front, locals say nothing has been done.The Gurung Tourism Entrepreneurs Association has named the trekking route the Gurung Heritage Trail.“As trekking trails have been losing charm due to haphazard road construction, such trails are still untouched by modern development,” said Kisham Kumari Gurung, president of the association.“These trails can draw high-end trekkers, which can create jobs and increase the income of people in the areas,” said the president. “Gurung heritage trail has a combination of nature and culture.”Gurung heritage trekking trail has been developed from Tangting to Danda-Tapro-Kwhlosothar-Thulilek-Thurju-Dudh Pokhari-Gurung Deurali-Danfe Kharka-Timang to Besi Sahar, said Bobar Jung Gurung, founding president of the association. The association's members and others recently conducted a 10-day trekking trail exploration and promotion programme.The trekking trail includes Kwhlosothar (3,283 metres); Thulilek, a vast grazing area (4,070 metres); Dudh Pokhari, a religious place (4,585 metres); Namun Bhanjyang (5,560 metres); and Danfe Kharka, a yak grazing area (3,862 metres).The Annapurna Conservation Area Project and the Trekking Agency Association of Nepal coordinated the exploration. The trekking can be completed in 12 days.As a motor road has been reached to Ghandruk and Ghorepani of Annapurna Conservation Area, reducing the charm of trekking, the new trekking trail can be an alternative, said Deepak Sapkota, a member of the Trekking Agency Association of Nepal, Gandaki.“In this area, we can revive camping trekking, which can be a big draw for trekkers.” \nThe popular social media platform TikTok has officially registered in Nepal. TikTok representatives received its registration letter from the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology on Tuesday.TikTok initiated the registration process in the second week of October in accordance with the 2023 Directives on Operation of Social Networking issued by the government. The platform has committed to following the regulation’s requirements and additional provisions mandated by a Cabinet meeting on August 22. According to the Cabinet’s decisions, TikTok must contribute to promoting tourism in Nepal, invest in digital literacy initiatives, support improvements in Nepal’s public education system, and ensure decent language use on its platform.TikTok becomes the third social media company to register with the ministry after Viber and WeChat. The government has also been urging other major social media platforms to complete the registration process.“Now our laws apply to TikTok within our territory,” said Gajendra Kumar Thakur, spokesperson for the Communications Ministry. “If any unlawful content appears on the platform, Nepal Police’s Cyber Bureau can take action with TikTok’s cooperation. TikTok has already provided certain tools to support Nepal Police in criminal investigations.”In addition to its commitment to promoting digital literacy and tourism, TikTok has designated Ram Bahadur Thapa as its main focal person for Nepal. “We have limited information about him so far, but TikTok has provided his address, phone number, and other details in its registration application,” Thakur added.The ministry has also corresponded with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and X CEO Elon Musk, requesting them to register their respective platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and X in Nepal. “Although we haven’t received responses yet, we hope these major companies will reply,” Thakur said. “If they fail to respond, we will follow up. Eventually, they must register.”The Council of Ministers has made it mandatory that social media platforms operating in Nepal must actively promote the country’s tourism, support internet and digital literacy programmes, and help enhance the quality of public education through digital cooperation in the country. The regulations also require social media companies to implement content moderation and filtering practices, remove material that could harm social harmony or spread obscenity, and aid in controlling cybercrimes.Digital rights advocates have acknowledged the importance of the registration process but have raised concerns over the content filtering requirement, warning that it could pose risks to freedom of expression. They argue that government directives should not restrict the right to expression based on the agreements reached with the private companies.The previous coalition government of the Maoist Centre and Nepali Congress, approved the social media regulations on November 9, 2023. Four days later, a Cabinet meeting chaired by Maoist Centre chief Pushpa Kamal Dahal decided to ban TikTok, citing its potential to disrupt social harmony. After nearly ten months, the incumbent government under Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli lifted the TikTok ban in August.Following the adoption of the social media guidelines, the ministry had formed a five-member social media management unit to oversee the implementation of the regulations. Last year, the unit notified platforms of their obligation to register within three months and emailed English translations of the guidelines to the companies concerned. The ministry hopes TikTok’s registration will encourage other platforms to follow suit. \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli on Thursday congratulated Donald Trump on his victory in the 2024 US presidential election.In a social media post, Oli congratulated the president-elect and described Trump’s return to office as a “historic chapter in American history.”He expressed optimism about strengthening Nepal-US relations under Trump’s leadership, highlighting a commitment to “mutual prosperity and cooperation” between the two nations.Earlier on Wednesday, President Ramchandra Paudel congratulated Trump as the Republican candidate won the election for a second term, defeating Kamala Harris of the Democratic Party.In the message shared on social media, President Paudel expressed confidence that the Nepal-US relationship would be further strengthened during Trump’s upcoming tenure.Trump was elected president, capping a remarkable comeback four years after he was voted out of the White House and ushering in a new American leadership likely to test democratic institutions at home and relations abroad, the international news agency Reuters reported.Trump, 78, recaptured the White House on Wednesday by securing more than the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the presidency. \nDonald Trump overcame them all. A felon convicted 34 times over. A pair of assassination attempts. Endorsement of Kamala Harris, his Democratic rival, by major news organisations and Hollywood A-listers. The baggage of history, whereby in the past 100 years just one other person had won a non-consecutive American presidential election. The opposition’s message that Trump harboured fascist tendencies, that he was openly misogynistic, that he had no concrete plan besides the vacuous ‘Make America Great Again’ slogan—they all fell on deaf ears. On election eve, most Americans said the economy was their top priority and they seem to have voted accordingly—never mind that the US continues to be the best performing rich economy, by a long shot. Whatever the state of the overall economy, many Americans felt their personal lives were getting worse. Harris also clearly failed to kindle hope as first-time voters, especially young men, leaned towards Trump. Arab-Americans were unhappy with US President Joe Biden’s handling of the war in Palestine, and Vice-president Harris seems to have lost many of their votes as a result. It was also interesting that more Americans saw in Trump a better presidential material than they did in Harris.So what does Trump’s triumph mean, especially for the rest of the democratic world? A few lessons emerge. One, it reinforces the message that voters are far from rational creatures and tend to vote with their hearts. Logically, compared to 2020, more Blacks voting for Trump, someone who harbours white supremacist views, does not make sense. Nor does the fact of Arab-Americans voting for Trump, who is likely to be worse when it comes to protecting the rights of the Palestinians. Even more generally, why would you choose someone who neither has the temperament nor the credentials to handle arguably the most important job in the world? But, again, in this age of social media, hard logic alone is insufficient. For example, many first-time male voters said they were persuaded to vote for Trump after watching 30-second Republican messages on TikTok. And most Americans think they are worse off today than they were four years ago, despite many indications to the contrary. Concomitantly, by appealing to people’s baser instincts, a lying Trump could capture many votes than a rather wooden but more truthful Harris.As in the US, there is a lot of disgruntlement in Nepal, especially among the youth. They feel cheated by old parties and their ageing leaders. Yet newer parties have also failed to gain their trust. Currently, it is unclear what this state of perpetual disgruntlement will lead to. Another Bangladesh, some suspect. People are looking for options to the status quo. Again, as in the US, a strongman may emerge in order to tap into this deep sense of frustration. Like Trump’s tropes, the message of these strongmen will be simple yet emotionally-laden and hence easy to gulp down in a world increasingly drowned in confusing online chatter. We often take our liberties for granted. But as the appeal of ‘democratic strongmen’ like Trump grows far and wide, those freedoms may come under jeopardy. If the US, with its strong history of check and balance, is struggling to manage a single man’s challenge to democracy, a country like Nepal with its weak institutions will be a lot more vulnerable to despotism.   \nMultilateral institutions are becoming the new reality in the geopolitical landscape. On October 22-24, Russia hosted the 16th Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS) summit at Kazan. The summit was projected as a diplomatic success for Russia, sending a message to the West that it is not isolated internationally and continues to be courted by important countries around the world. BRICS started as a group of four emerging economies in 2006 and later included South Africa in 2010. Since then, it has expanded to add new members, i.e. Saudi Arabia, Iran, Ethiopia, Egypt, Argentina and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), giving economic teeth to the organisation. BRICS comprises 41 percent of the world population, having 24 percent of the world GDP and over 16 percent share of the world trade. With the new members joining, its potential is set to increase exponentially. Relevance of BRICSEven though obituaries of the organisation have been written by analysts who argue that BRICS does not have the potential to emerge as an organisation of geopolitical relevance, it continues to be pertinent to a multipolar global order currently dominated by Western countries, which China and Russia challenge. For India, BRICS remains an important multilateral vehicle in its foreign policy. While the Western countries perceive both Russia and China as antithetical to Western values and West-dominated global order, India continues to be a linchpin in the US strategy for the Indo-Pacific.However, India has avoided a direct confrontation with China. It has underlined the importance of the Indo-Pacific Economic Forum and other pillars of cooperation, such as enhancing maritime security, counterterrorism, non-proliferation and cyber issues between the countries of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue.Multilateralism, multi-alignment and multipolarity attest to the fact that the world order is in flux. While the US-dominated international system is in crisis for failing to establish peace, an accountable international system like the BRICS, a multilateral financial institution that caters to the economic needs of developing countries or has climate governance sensitive to the requirements of the developing world, emerged as an organisation promising inclusive international order. Further, the New Development Bank, established by BRICS states, funds projects in different countries and caters to the needs of developing countries. As of 2019, the bank had funded 45 projects with loans aggregating to $12.5 billion.Critics labelled BRICS as part of a China-led global order like the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO). However, its recent expansion showed that an alternative to the US-dominated order has pushed many countries to apply for membership, despite sceptics saying the organisation has not achieved anything.Admission of new members, done by consensus, is frozen at the moment. Such a move has dejected many countries aspiring for full membership. Several South Asian countries aspire to join BRICS, and India will play an essential role in getting them on the board as and when membership is open. The organisation is also interested in partnering with Emerging Markets and Developing Countries (EMDCs). There is concern that BRICS should not emerge as a forum for geopolitical contestation, with contradictory interests that could render the organisation defunct.The member countries emphasise the global south and how strengthening multilateralism would further their interest. Given the dominance of Western powers in several organisations, the global south feels unheard. In this context, emphasising other multilateral organisations has become vital. BRICS and outreach programmes remain a critical forum for dialogue among aspiring countries. It gives the UN a central role as a global body and underlines the need for the organisation to be equitable and geographically inclusive.It needs to be underlined that the UN remains relevant along with other statutory bodies. However, the global south feels alienated as the Security Council enjoys immense power, and there is no sign of UN reform in the near future. As Brazil currently holds the presidency of the G20, it will bring issues such as sustainability, sustainable development, climate change, poverty reduction, and so on—concerns that affect the Global South—to the agenda of the G20 summit.Overall, the Kazan summit defined the essence of BRICS at a time when several multilateral forums are flourishing. It emphasises “a more representative, fairer international order, a reinvigorated and reformed multilateral system, sustainable development and inclusive growth.” While this statement embodies the aspirations of the BRICS members, the ideas remain a glue for further global cooperation.India and BRICSFor the past few years, India has been pursuing its foreign policy by being involved in several multilateral organisations. Its relationship with both Russia and China has been significant. Russia has remained a vital defence partner of India since independence. While India has diversified its defence procurement, it depends on Russia for spare parts and equipment servicing. Russian weapons have kept India in good stead. Western powers pressurised India when it decided to purchase S 400 S-400 anti-aircraft systems. Similarly, India’s purchase of Russian oil has helped its economy. For a long time, the country has been balancing its relationship with both Russia and Ukraine, given the Russia-Ukraine war, which has made Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy unhappy. The disengagement at the India-China border and the restoration of normal patrolling, following an agreement between the two countries, would benefit India. This summit facilitated a bilateral meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping on the sidelines, which contributed to the disengagement of India-China troops at the border. It is important to note that India does not want the opposition to the Western-dominated world order be replaced by a Russia-China dominated alternative international order.Multilateralism remains a key part of India’s foreign policy. The underlying theme is that it ‘does not believe in a world order where few are considered superior’. With no sight of the UN reforms, these multilateral organisations will help smaller groups of countries pursue their interest and get funding from alternative sources while being part of a UN-dominated global system. \nEconomics and economic policy need a rethink. This is clear from the scale of inequality, joblessness, insecurity and environmental disasters we see in the world. People feel left behind, impoverished and unvoiced. They are looking to ethno-nationalist strongmen to help them. Right-wing movements and governments are on the rise. As an economist who has written for many decades about debunking the neoclassical approaches to economic thinking, I think there is clear evidence that the mainstream ideas and policies no longer work.The dominant approaches to economic policy focus on a few narrow goals, such as growing gross domestic product (GDP) or suppressing inflation. The use of GDP since the late 1940s to understand the health of an economy has been criticised. What’s needed is a more precise understanding of the broad impact of macroeconomic policies, one that accounts for paid, unpaid and non-market work. The standard economic variables used by mainstream economics don’t consider all these. Mainstream policies don’t see the huge impact of unpaid care work on GDP. According to the International Labour Organisation an estimated 16.4 billion hours are spent on unpaid care work every day. This is equivalent to two billion people working eight hours a day with no remuneration.The idea of economic growth is also ill suited to evaluate improvements to well-being at the social level. Though growth in GDP can be a useful measure of economic activity, growth itself does not always bring better outcomes in terms of poverty, health or jobs. GDP growth can even worsen health status, pollute the environment, and reduce leisure time. Many countries are now starting to give indicators of well-being a central role in judging how well the economy is doing. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, such as New Zealand, have been looking at measuring societal progress in terms of how well people and households are doing.The human rights approach is another way to judge economic policies and their outcomes. It’s different from the dominant approach in economics, which is mainly interested in the ability of individuals to make choices that maximise their own individual satisfaction, termed “utility”. If, instead, the purpose of the economy was to fulfil rights, we would have a very different set of policy priorities. Like equality in the right to leisure, the right to an adequate standard of living, and the right to housing, education and health.A human rights approachThe human rights approach allows for a complex interaction between individual rights, collective rights and collective action. It sees policy as a social and political process that should conform to human rights standards. It recognises that states can both enable and deny social justice. Individuals need the power of the state to realise their rights but also need protection against misuse of state power. The human rights framework looks beyond GDP or income when evaluating economic outcomes. It looks to the realisation of economic and social rights over time. Social justice makes advances when the enjoyment of the rights to an adequate standard of living, education, health, work and social security, among others, improves over time. These aspects of the human rights framework can be used to evaluate and assess economic policies and their outcomes.Many of these human rights aspects are implicit in wellbeing indicators but are not clearly stated. The measurement of wellbeing highlights inequalities, focuses on people and outcomes at the individual and household level, and allows for an analysis of inequalities. But the criteria it uses are not well articulated, especially in terms of gender equality.The environmentOne of the serious shortcomings of an approach that regards growth as the solution to economic crisis is that continued growth has environmental limits and potentially catastrophic consequences. The larger question is whether economic growth is sustainable over time and whether it can be achieved in a sustainable way. There is some attention to sustainability within the human rights framework. For example, a clean environment is necessary for the full enjoyment of human rights. But this relationship needs to be better understood, beyond environmental crisis.The OECD has developed a series of indicators to measure wellbeing in many countries. They are: income and wealth; work and job quality; housing; health; knowledge and skills; environmental quality; subjective wellbeing; safety; work-life balance; social connection; and civil engagement. The resources for future wellbeing are natural capital, economic capital, human capital and social capital. These are attempts at considering wellbeing but are still very economistic and capital oriented. It’s necessary to go beyond looking at the negative consequences of pollution to radically shift how development is conceived. Ecuador, for example, is using the concept of Buen Vivir, which is based on indigenous traditions and values of the Andean region. It departs from western ideas of affluence and growth; instead it is about harmony with oneself, the community and nature.Some of the language around Buen Vivir is around rights, such as the right to a good life, and the rights of nature. The right to a good life includes the rights to nutrition, health, education and water, and uses the economic, social and cultural rights norms. The concept of Buen Vivir has some problems, though, like its scalability and the gender assumptions of indigenous traditions.To address the roots of people’s disenchantment and avoid ecological catastrophe, we must develop new approaches to economic policy. Instead of using growth as the measure of an economy’s health, there are other approaches to consider, like wellbeing, human rights and Buen Vivir. Each approach has its limitations. But bringing them into conversation is a start when asking the most basic of questions: What is the economy for?—The ConversationRead the original article here. \nSince taking office around three months ago, Health Minister Pradip Paudel has announced several initiatives focused on free healthcare programmes. Although these announcements appear laudable at the outset, those acquainted with our healthcare system suspect they will do more harm than good. Such a spree of free healthcare programmes is impractical in a nation where funding for even basic health facilities is scarce. Isn’t the availability of facilities a prerequisite for making them “free” to the public?Last week, Minister Paudel announced three free programmes, including free treatment for cancer patients under 14. A week before that, Paudel had pledged free care for burn victims who cannot afford treatment. But how will these be executed as hospitals lack vital resources? Every year, around 1,500 children under 14 have cancer. Many have no option but to travel abroad for treatment due to a lack of positron emission tomography (PET) scans, immunohistochemistry, bone marrow transplants and other important tests. Moreover, there is a severe shortage of support staff in health facilities. On burn care, most health facilities only provide basic treatments, compromising patient safety even as, according to the ministry, around 57,000 people are affected by it every year.Without proper budget allocation, such ambitious programmes are bound to fail. In the budget for the current fiscal year, the health sector received Rs86.24 billion, which was only a 2.5 percent increase from the previous fiscal year. With only 4.6 percent of the total budget dedicated to healthcare, experts warned about its long-term impacts, potentially affecting crucial milestones achieved over the years. Several healthcare programmes, including those related to safe motherhood, child health, nutrition, and mental health, were already impeded by the cut in the previous year’s budget. What’s more, the agencies under the ministry don’t even have the funds to provide something as basic as mental health screening training to children and adolescents. While the health minister unveils one free programme after another, the agencies under the ministry seek funds from aid agencies to carry them forward. At a press conference 100 days after assuming office, Paudel claimed that federal hospitals are now better organised and he would now focus on health insurance reform. However, his promise to do away with long waiting lines at state hospitals within a month and raise the coverage of the government’s health insurance scheme to Rs500,000 have yet to be realised. Such long queues reflect the poor healthcare accessibility, with facilities mostly Kathmandu-centric. Over the years, patient numbers have increased exponentially, even while there has been no rise in human resources in state-run hospitals in the past three decades. All of these reflect how misguided and superficial these health-related commitments are. In yet another example of incompetence, the health ministry released a circular in September to operate outpatient services on public holidays. How is this sustainable in a system where doctors are already overworked and offered no extra incentives?Perhaps the health minister should focus more on using available funds to push the current healthcare programmes than on starting more ambitious initiatives. Nepalis have had their fill of populist vows that disregard their well-being, especially in an area as basic as healthcare. Government representatives would do well not to make lofty promises that adds burden on our already overworked healthcare providers.  \nA threat by Donald Trump, who has been elected as the next US president, to impose 60% tariffs on US imports of Chinese goods poses major growth risks for the world’s second-largest economy.Not only are the tariff rates much higher than the 7.5%-25% levied on China during his first term, the economy is also in a much more vulnerable position.This is what is different:Property market crisisIn 2018, the property market was strong, driving about a quarter of China’s economic activity. That meant local government finances, heavily reliant on auctioning land for residential projects, were not questioned so forcefully. This helped China absorb the tariff shock. But since 2021, real estate has been in a severe downturn and local government revenues have plunged.Housing oversupply means this sector may never return to the driving seat of Chinese economic growth. DebtThe property sector’s downturn has saddled local governments with unsustainable debt.While Beijing is lining up fiscal help for them to curb their liabilities, the burden is huge, limiting China’s ability to respond to any external growth shocks. The International Monetary Fund calculates total government sector debt at 147 trillion yuan ($20.7 trillion) at the end of 2023. Add household and corporate debt and that number surpasses 350 trillion yuan - roughly three times the size of the economy, according to the Bank for International Settlements.Weak domestic demandLow wages and pensions, high youth unemployment and a feeble social safety net leave China’s household spending below 40% of GDP, about 20 percentage points behind the global average.Boosting that requires either more debt or an overhaul of how national income is distributed, so that it benefits households at the expense of government and businesses. That could be achieved by changing how companies and households are taxed and how government spends the money, raising retirement, health and unemployment benefits and removing an internal passport system responsible for huge rural-urban inequalities, among other reforms.So far, however, authorities have focused on upgrading the export-reliant manufacturing sector instead, with remarkable success in electric vehicles, solar energy and batteries.But this also prompted tariffs in the United States, Europe, Turkey and elsewhere.China may be able to boost external sales in areas where its economy is extremely competitive, but has little control on external demand.Deflationary pressuresThe property crisis, the debt overhang and weak consumption have all fuelled deflationary pressures.China’s policy of redirecting resources from the property market to the manufacturing sector, rather than consumers, has fuelled what Western governments describe as industrial overcapacity. This has led to factory gate deflation. Producer price inflation was 4.6% in July 2018 when Trump’s first tariffs came into effect. In September 2024 this stood at minus 2.8%. Consumer price inflation has ground to a paltry 0.4% from 2.1% over that period.Deflation, which hurts consumption, businesses and growth, could get much worse if tariffs shrink external demand, exacerbating industrial overcapacity.Limited room for currency depreciationThe yuan ended 2019 roughly 10% weaker against the dollar than in early 2018, when Washington flagged the tariffs plan and 4% weaker in trade-weighted terms against all currencies. The US curbs increased the effective tariff rate on all Chinese exports by 2.4 percentage points, according to Capital Economics analysts, which means that the yuan’s depreciation more than offset the tariff impact. This time, the yuan might have to fall 18% against the dollar to fully offset 60% US tariffs, implying a rate of 8.5 per dollar, the analysts calculated - levels unseen since the 1990s Asian financial crisis.Worried about capital outflows, authorities tried to prevent the yuan from weakening past 7.3 earlier this year. A full adjustment looks unlikely.Other factorsDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Washington unleashed trillions of dollars in stimulus, including cash handouts to consumers, some of which was spent on goods made in China.Also, after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Moscow got shut out of many Western markets, pushing it to source more goods from China.These were unexpected opportunities for Beijing, and are unlikely to be repeated. \nGermany’s ruling coalition collapsed on Wednesday as Chancellor Olaf Scholz sacked his finance minister and paved the way for a snap election, triggering political chaos in Europe’s largest economy hours after Donald Trump won the US presidential election.After sacking Finance Minister Christian Lindner of the Free Democrats (FDP) party, Scholz is expected to head a minority government with his Social Democrats and the Greens, the second-largest party.He would have to rely on cobbled-together parliamentary majorities to pass legislation and he plans to hold a parliamentary confidence vote in his government on Jan. 15, which could trigger snap elections by the end of March.Scholz said he would ask Friedrich Merz, leader of the opposition conservatives who are far ahead in polls, for support in passing the budget and boosting military spending. Merz is due to respond in a Thursday morning news conference.The collapse of Scholz’s three-way alliance caps months of wrangling over budget policy and Germany’s economic direction, with the government’s popularity sinking and far-right and far-left forces surging.“We need a government that is able to act, that has the strength to make the necessary decisions for our country,” Scholz told reporters.Scholz said he fired Lindner for his obstructive behaviour on budget disputes, accusing the minister of putting party before country and blocking legislation on spurious grounds.The move comes a day after the election of Republican Donald Trump as US president, with Europe scrambling to form a united response on issues from possible new US tariffs to Russia’s war in Ukraine and the future of the NATO alliance.The government crisis comes at a critical juncture for Germany, with a flatlining economy, aging infrastructure and an unprepared military.A political shake-up could fuel growing frustration with Germany’s mainstream parties to the benefit of younger populist movements, including the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD).With France also facing political uncertainty after snap elections this year, turmoil in the European Union’s two largest economies could hamper efforts to deepen the bloc’s integration at a time when it is facing challenges from east and west.DEBT BRAKE SUSPENSION DEMANDThe coalition has been at odds over how best to rescue Europe’s largest economy, which is facing its second year of contraction and a crisis in its economic model after the end of cheap gas from Russia following its 2022 invasion of Ukraine and amid increasing competition from China.Scholz said he had proposed capping energy costs for companies to bolster Germany’s appeal as a place to do business. He wanted a package to help save jobs in the ailing auto industry, as well as increased support for Ukraine.The FDP had proposed public spending cuts, lower taxes and less regulation as the answer to the malaise. It also wants to slow Germany’s shift to a carbon-neutral economy.Speaking after Scholz, Lindner said the chancellor had tried to strong-arm him into breaking a constitutionally-enshrined spending limit known as the debt brake, a move that Lindner, a fiscal hawk, refused to support.Government sources said Scholz had wanted to increase a Ukraine support package by 3 billion euros ($3.22 billion) to 15 billion euros and to finance it by suspending the debt brake.“Olaf Scholz refuses to recognise that our country needs a new economic model,” Lindner told reporters. “Olaf Scholz has showed he doesn’t have the strength to give his country a new boost.”The SPD and the Greens, while at odds on some issues, agree that targeted government spending is needed.The three other FDP ministers - for transport, justice, and education - all voluntarily left the government.Scholz said Lindner was focused on the short-term survival of his own party. “Especially today, one day after such an important event as the US elections, this kind of selfishness is utterly incomprehensible.”Economy Minister Robert Habeck of the Greens said the coalition could not agree on how to plug a funding gap in the budget for next year.“I want to say on our behalf that tonight feels wrong and doesn’t feel right. It’s almost tragic on a day like today, when Germany needs to show unity and capacity for action in Europe.” \n Donald Trump reshaped the US electorate once again this year, piling up support among Hispanic voters, young people, and Americans without college degrees — and winning more votes in nearly all of the country as he reclaimed the presidency.Following the Republican’s populist campaign, in which he promised to shield workers from global economic competition and offered a wide range of tax-cut proposals, Trump’s increasing strength among working-class voters and nonwhite Americans helped grow his share of the vote almost everywhere.The starkest increase may have been the 14-percentage-point swing in Trump’s share of Hispanic voters, according to an exit poll conducted by Edison Research. Some 46% of self-identified Hispanic voters picked Trump, up from 32% in the 2020 election when Trump lost to Democrat Joe Biden.Hispanics have largely favored Democrats for decades, but Trump’s share this year was the highest for a Republican presidential candidate in exit polls going back to the 1970s, and just higher than the 44% share won by Republican George W. Bush in 2004, according to data compiled by the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank.In counties where more than 20% of voting-age Americans were Hispanic, Trump’s margin over Democratic Vice President Kamala Harrisimproved by 13 points relative to his 2020 performance against Biden.“Young Hispanics do not have the same muscle memory as their grandparents who voted for Democrats for 50 years,” said Giancarlo Sopo, a Republican media strategist who worked on Hispanic outreach for Trump’s 2020 campaign.This time, Trump won 55% of Hispanic men, 19 points more than the 36% share he won four years earlier, while he garnered support from 38% of Hispanic women, up 8 points from 2020.Trump has made opposition to immigration a cornerstone of his political career, pledging to conduct mass deportations of people living in the US illegally. Many Hispanic voters supported Trump’s hardline positions, according to the Edison Research exit poll. About a quarter of Hispanic respondents said most immigrants in the country without documentation should be deported to the countries they came from, compared with 40% of voters overall in the poll.ECONOMIC CONCERNSHispanic Americans skew more working-class than the country’s white majority, with larger shares of Hispanics lacking college degrees, according to US Census Bureau estimates.Hispanics also tend to be younger than average in America, which means many have had less time to build wealth and have also been more exposed to the economic troubles of recent years, including high inflation and soaring interest rates for mortgages. Trump won 43% of voters age 18 to 29 - 7 points more than in 2020.About two-thirds of voters considered the US economy in poor shape, compared with about half of 2020 voters. Some 46% said their family’s financial situation was worse than four years ago, compared with 20% who said the same in 2020.“Republicans have consistently beat Democrats on connecting with voters on the economy,” said Clarissa Martinez De Castro, vice president of the nonpartisan UnidosUS Latino Vote Initiative. “This was a referendum on the economy, and that has consistently been the number one, two and three issues for Hispanic voters.”In the battleground state of Arizona, a state Biden won in 2020, Mexican-born Arturo Laguna became an American citizen earlier this year and cast his first US presidential ballot for Trump, citing the Republican’s conservatism and his embrace of restrictions on abortion access.“The three biggest things of importance are family values, being pro-life and religion,” said Laguna, a 28-year-old corporate manager. “I don’t feel like Kamala represents those values.”Across the country, in places where almost all votes were counted - roughly 2,200 counties nationwide - Trump’s margin was 5 points higher than it was in 2020.This broad increase - a rise of the Republican tide - in part owed to Trump’s gains among voters without college degrees, a massive class of voters that spans racial and ethnic categories and made up just over half of the electorate on Tuesday.Some 56% of voters without degrees picked Trump, up 6 points from the Republican’s share in the 2020 exit poll. Harris won 55% of voters who have degrees, unchanged from Biden’s share in 2020, when affluent suburbs helped power the Democrat’s victory.Trump’s gains build on major shifts in the electorate since his triumph in the 2016 presidential election, when he outperformed past Republicans by far among working-class white voters. He largely maintained his dominance with the group this year, winning 66% of their vote, with his share down 1 point from 2020, according to the Edison Research exit poll.Among people without college degrees and who are not white, however, Trump’s share of the vote increased by 8 points.While Trump gained ground in vote tallies across most of the country, some of his biggest advances were in and around big cities, areas that have been critical for past Democratic victories.Trump flipped Nassau County - just east of New York City on Long Island - winning about 52 percent of the vote there.And in the 25 big urban counties where nearly all the votes had been tallied by Wednesday morning, Harris won 60 percent of the vote, down about 5 percentage points from Biden’s performance in 2020 and the lowest share for a Democrat in those counties since at least 2012.Harris won 53% of the women’s vote, while Trump won 55% of the vote by men, with Trump performing slightly better with both groups compared with 2020. \nThe Meteorological Forecasting Division has predicted partly cloudy skies in the hilly regions of Nepal on Thursday, with fair to partly cloudy weather across the rest of the country.Light rain, accompanied by thunder and lightning, is likely at one or two locations in the hilly areas of Koshi, Gandaki, and Sudurpaschim provinces.For tonight, the hilly areas are expected to remain partly cloudy, while the rest of the country will experience mainly fair conditions. The division cited the influence of western and local winds on the current weather patterns.On Wednesday, Janakpur recorded the highest temperature at 36.2°C, while Jomsom saw the lowest at 3.5°C. The most rainfall was observed in Jiri, with 3.2 mm in the past 24 hours. \nSunil Babu Pant has played many roles. As the first openly gay parliament member, he helped inshrine LGBTQ rights in the Nepali constitution. He was also a monk, has a tourism agency, and made a documentary ‘Ajima and Six Gender Identities.’In this conversation with the Post’s Xenia Klaus, Pant shares his thoughts on storytelling and literature's role in his activism and filmmaking.You are a politician, an LGBTQ activist, a tourist guide and, since recently, a filmmaker. Is there one book that has influenced you through all of it?It wasn’t just one book; a vast body of literature impacted me. I started reading philosophical and religious books seriously as a young teenager, and they affected me deeply. Through this reading, I discovered Mahayana Buddhism. Unlike Theravada Buddhism, which often centres on suffering, Mahayana encourages you to engage with the world. Life isn’t only about your enlightenment or meditation—it’s about much more. This idea inspired me, and I became a committed practitioner.Is there one book that stands out among this vast body of literature?One book that had particular significance for me was ‘Bodhicharyavatara’ by Shantideva. In it, he discusses cultivating a selfless, compassionate mind that opens itself up to others. The book provides many examples of living a life of compassion—like the story of sacrificing one’s feet to feed a starving tiger.You later became a monk, but how has all this reading influenced your other work, for example, as an LGBTQ activist?Buddhism and Hinduism have shaped my worldview and, by extension, all of my work. Along the way, I found more specific influences as well. As I studied these texts, I began to see connections between them. One Hindu figure who has deeply inspired me is the goddess Kali. I admire her so much—she wears her hair loose and even steps on Shiva. Seeing her made me realise how different she is from the expectations society still often has for women; she is beyond imposed morality, fully free. Yet, she is still worshipped. This was a revolutionary idea for me and has inspired my journey toward self-liberation and freedom.Theology and philosophy are intense reading for a teen. How did you initially get into reading those books?I was fortunate to have an educated father who was a teacher and a wonderful storyteller. He loved Bollywood movies, theology, and epic Hindu dramas. Whenever he returned from Kathmandu, he’d bring colourful movie magazines. My love for reading began with him, and soon I was hooked. Nowadays, it's harder to find time to sit down and read a book, but back in the village, reading was the only way to nourish my mind and soul.Is there other literature besides philosophical and religious texts that have influenced your work?I also read extensively about history, including the LGBTQ movements in Europe and America, the Dalit movement, and the histories of Hinduism and Buddhism. Learning about our country’s history has been helpful for my political work; it gives me insight into the roots of our present struggles and how they are interconnected.It seems that philosophical books provided a constant foundation for your worldview, which you then expanded upon with insights from the specific topics you focused on.That sounds about right. Do you read fiction?After getting into philosophical books, I also started reading romances and science fiction. But the romances, in particular, often disturbed me; the gender roles and society’s judgments on love created anxiety and left me feeling distanced. Besides, fiction rarely sticks with me like other genres do. It doesn’t nourish me like philosophical books do. For me, fiction is more a form of entertainment than something fulfilling.I would argue that science fiction, for example, can be intellectually stimulating, as it encourages one to imagine different possible futures.That is true, but sometimes, it is too much for me. It makes me lose my inner balance. One fiction book I really like, though, is ‘Siddharta’ by Hermann Hesse.Are you into poetry?Oh, I love poetry. It feeds the heart and soul. You recently made a documentary, ‘Ajima and the Six Gender Identities’. Did you implement the lessons about storytelling you learned from all your reading?The most valuable storytelling lessons came from my father and family, not from books. As the youngest child, I remember gathering around before or after dinner, and my father would tell stories. My family encouraged me to tell stories, too, and everyone would clap. That positive feedback made me love storytelling from an early age.What does one need to be a good storyteller? To be a good storyteller, you must first be a great listener, listening to all the stories around you. It’s also essential to understand that humans have five senses, but most storytelling doesn’t engage all of them. When telling stories orally, you rely only on your voice. So, your voice must work extra hard to convey the experiences of touch, smell, sight, and taste—it has to bring all those senses to life.Sunil Babu Pant’s book recommendationsBodhicharyavatara Author: ShantidevaPublisher: VariousYear: Circa 700 ADThis is a great option for those who don’t have the time to read vast literature but still wish to grasp the core teachings of Mahayana Buddhism.The Words of My Perfect Teacher Author: Patrul RinpochePublisher: VariousYear: 19th centuryWise individuals can sometimes become arrogant.

Sunisa Bongkodphongampai also picked a wicket.In reply, Nepal bowled Thailand out for 35 inside 11.4 overs on the back of a four-wicket haul from Rachanna Chaudhary.Chaudhary returned the match figures of 4-10 in her magical three-over spell, including three scalps in the ninth over (8.1, 8.2 and 8.5 overs) that also included the wicket of Thailand’s top scorer Aphisara Suwanchonrathi (13).Riya Sharma also shone with the ball, taking two wickets in her four deliveries, while Puja Mahato grabbed two Thailand wickets giving away just three runs in her economical three overs.Except for opener Aphisara, no Thailand batters were able to reach the double digit figures.Hosts UAE, Nepal, Kuwait, and Thailand are competing in the Asia Qualifiers, with the top team at the end of the double round robin league earning their spot in the ICC U-19 Women’s T20 World Cup 2025, which is set to be held in Malaysia.India won the inaugural edition by defeating England by seven wickets in the final in Potchefstroom, South Africa in January last year.The UAE also began their campaign with a 106-run victory over Kuwait, courtesy of unbeaten half-centuries from Lavanya Keny (77 not out) and Samaira Dharnidharka (58 not out), and brilliant bowlings from Mehak Thakur (2-2), Al Maseera Jahangir (2-3) and Lavanya Keny (2-5).The hosts posted 143-1 from the allotted 20 overs before limiting the Kuwaitis to 37-10 in 15.2 overs.Nepal next play Kuwait on Thursday, while the UAE take on Thailand.The winners of the Asia Qualifier will join the other four teams who have already secured their tickets to the World Cup through regional qualifiers. Nigeria qualified from Africa, Samoa from East Asia Pacific and Scotland from Europe. The United States automatically qualified from the Americas region—and for a second time in a row—as they were the only team in the region to meet the criteria required to enter the qualification pathway.The 10 full-members teams from the 2023 U-19 Women’s T20 World Cup—Australia, Bangladesh, England, India, Ireland, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa, Sri Lanka and West Indies—have already received direct entry.Malaysia qualified as hosts.U-19 Women’s T20 World CUp Asia QualifierThe Sevens Stadium, AjmanTOSS: Thailand, bowl first.Nepal 102-6 (20/20 overs)Puja Mahato 35 (40), Seem KC 19*(19); Charukan Saema 4-0-20-2Thailand 35-10 (11.4/20 overs)Aphisara Suwanchonrathi 13 (23), Nattharika Thokoi 6(7); Rachanna Chaudhary 3-0-10-4, Riya Sharma 0.4-0-0-2, Puja Mahato 3-1-3-2Nepal win by 67 runs.Nepal’s next fixturesNov 7Nepal vs KuwaitNov 9Nepal vs UAENov 10Nepal vs ThailandNov 12Nepal vs KuwaitNov 13Nepal vs UAE \nDonald Trump was elected president, capping a remarkable comeback four years after he was voted out of the White House and ushering in a new American leadership likely to test democratic institutions at home and relations abroad.Trump, 78, recaptured the White House on Wednesday by securing more than the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the presidency, Edison Research projected, following a campaign of dark rhetoric that deepened the polarization in the country.The former president’s victory in the swing state of Wisconsin pushed him over the threshold.“America has given us an unprecedented and powerful mandate,” Trump said early on Wednesday to a roaring crowd of supporters at the Palm Beach County Convention Center in Florida.Trump’s political career had appeared to be over after his false claims of election fraud led a mob of supporters to storm the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, in a failed bid to overturn his 2020 defeat.But he swept away challengers inside his Republican Party and then beat Democratic candidate Kamala Harris by capitalizing on voter concerns about high prices and what Trump claimed, without evidence, was a rise in crime due to illegal immigration.Harris did not speak to supporters who had gathered at her alma mater Howard University. Her campaign co-chair, Cedric Richmond, briefly addressed the crowd after midnight, saying Harris would speak publicly later on Wednesday.“We still have votes to count,” he said.Republicans won a US Senate majority, but neither party appeared to have an edge in the fight for control of the House of Representatives where Republicans currently hold a narrow majority.Jobs and EconomyVoters identified jobs and the economy as the country’s most pressing problem, according to Reuters/Ipsos opinion polls. Many Americans remained frustrated by higher prices even amid record-high stock markets, fast-growing wages and low unemployment. With the administration of President Joe Biden taking much of the blame, a majority of voters said they trusted Trump more than Harris to address the issue.Hispanics, traditionally Democratic voters, and lower-income households hit hardest by inflation helped fuel Trump's election victory. His loyal base of rural, white and non-college educated voters again showed up in force.Trump prevailed despite persistently low approval ratings. Impeached twice, he has been criminally indicted four times and found civilly liable for sexual abuse and defamation. In May, Trump was convicted by a New York jury of falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments to a porn star.His victory will have major implications for US trade and climate change policies, the war in Ukraine, Americans’ taxes and immigration.His tariff proposals could spark a fiercer trade war with China and US allies, while his pledges to reduce corporate taxes and implement a spate of new cuts could balloon US debt, economists say.Trump has promised to launch a mass deportation campaign targeting immigrants in the country illegally.He has said he wants the authority to fire civil servants he views as disloyal. His opponents fear he will turn the Justice Department and other federal law enforcement agencies into political weapons to investigate perceived enemies.A second Trump presidency could drive a bigger wedge between Democrats and Republicans on issues such as race, gender, what and how children are taught, and reproductive rights.Harris Falls ShortVice President Harris fell short in her 15-week sprint as a candidate, failing to galvanise enough support to defeat Trump, who occupied the White House from 2017-2021, or to allay voters' concerns about the economy and immigration.Harris had warned that Trump wanted unchecked presidential power and posed a danger to democracy.Nearly three-quarters of voters say American democracy is under threat, according to Edison Research exit polls, underscoring the polarization in a nation where divisions have only grown starker during a fiercely competitive race.Trump ran a campaign characterized by apocalyptic language. He called the United States a “garbage can” for immigrants, pledged to save the economy from “obliteration” and cast some rivals as the “enemy within.”His diatribes were often aimed at migrants, who he said were “poisoning the blood of the country,” or Harris, whom he frequently derided as unintelligent.Despite legal woes and controversies, Trump is only the second former president to win a second term after leaving the White House. The first was Grover Cleveland, who served two four-year terms starting in 1885 and 1893.Unprecedented CampaignIn May, Trump was convicted by a New York jury of falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments to a porn star. Two months later, a would-be assassin’s bullet grazed his right ear during a campaign rally, exacerbating fears about political violence. Another assassination attempt was thwarted in September at his Florida golf course. Trump blamed both attempts on what he claimed was the heated rhetoric of Democrats including Harris.Barely eight days after the July shooting, Biden, 81, dropped out of the race, finally bowing to weeks of pressure from his fellow Democrats after a poor performance during his debate with Trump called into question his mental acuity and the viability of his reelection bid.Biden’s decision to step aside turned the contest into a sprint, as Harris raced to mount her own campaign in a matter of weeks, rather than the typical months. Her rise to the top of the ticket reenergized despondent Democrats, and she raised more than $1 billion in less than three months while erasing what had been a solid Trump lead in opinion polls.Harris' financial advantage was partly countered by the intervention of the world's richest man, Elon Musk, who poured more than $100 million into a super PAC mobilizing Trump voters and used his social media site X to amplify pro-Trump messaging.As the campaign drew to a close, Harris increasingly focused on warning Americans about the perils of reelecting Trump and offered an olive branch to disaffected Republicans.She highlighted remarks from several former Trump officials, including his former chief of staff and retired Marine Corps General John Kelly, who described Trump as a “fascist.”Trump’s victory will broaden the fissures in American society, given his false claims of election fraud, anti-immigrant rhetoric and demonization of his political opponents, said Alan Abramowitz, a political science professor at Emory University who studies voter behaviour and party politics.A Trump Second TermTrump has vowed to reshape the executive branch, including firing civil servants he views as disloyal and using federal law enforcement agencies to investigate his political enemies, violating what has been a longstanding policy of keeping such agencies independent.During his first term, Trump’s most extreme demands were sometimes stymied by his own cabinet members, most notably when Vice President Mike Pence refused to block Congress from accepting the 2020 election results.Once the 2024 vote is certified by Congress on January 6, Trump and his vice president, US Senator JD Vance, are due to take office on Inauguration Day, January 20. Throughout his two-year-long campaign, Trump has signalled he will prioritize personal fealty in staffing his administration. He promised roles in his administration to Musk and former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., both avid supporters. \nRepublican Donald Trump claimed victory in the 2024 presidential contest after Fox News projected that he had defeated Democrat Kamala Harris, which would cap a stunning political comeback four years after he left the White House.“America has given us an unprecedented and powerful mandate,” he said early on Wednesday to a roaring crowd of supporters at the Palm Beach County Convention Center.Other news outlets had yet to call the race for Trump, but he appeared on the verge of winning after capturing the battleground states of Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Georgia and holding leads in the other four, according to Edison Research.Harris did not speak to her supporters, who had gathered at her alma mater Howard University. Her campaign co-chair, Cedric Richmond, briefly addressed the crowd after midnight, saying Harris would speak publicly on Wednesday.“We still have votes to count,” he said.The former president was showing strength across broad swaths of the country, improving on his 2020 performance everywhere from rural areas to urban centres.Republicans won a US Senate majority after flipping Democratic seats in West Virginia and Ohio. Neither party appeared to have an edge in the fight for control of the House of Representatives where Republicans currently hold a narrow majority.Trump went into Election Day with a 50-50 chance of reclaiming the White House, a remarkable turnaround from Jan. 6, 2021, when many pundits pronounced his political career to be over. That day, a mob of his supporters stormed Congress in a violent attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 election.Trump picked up more support from Hispanics, traditionally Democratic voters, and among lower-income households that have keenly felt the sting of price rises since the last presidential election in 2020, according to exit polls from Edison.Trump won 45% of Hispanic voters nationwide, trailing Harris with 53% but up 13 percentage points from 2020.About 31% of voters said the economy was their top issue, and they voted for Trump by a 79%-to-20% margin, according to exit polls. Some 45% of voters across the country said their family’s financial situation was worse off today than four years ago, and they favored Trump 80% to 17%.Global investors were increasingly pricing in a Trump win late on Tuesday. US stock futures and the dollar pushed higher, while Treasury yields climbed and bitcoin rose - all flagged by analysts and investors as trades that favor a Trump victory.At Howard University, where a large watch party was being held for Harris, supporters were leaving in droves, anticipating that the vice president would not address the crowd on Tuesday night.Cedric Richmond, a co-chair of the Harris campaign, briefly addressed the crowd and said Harris would not speak. “We still have votes to count,” he said. “We still have states that haven’t been called yet.”TRUMP OUTPERFORMS 2020Trump was earning a bigger share of the vote than he did four years ago in nearly every corner of the country.By 12:30 a.m. ET, officials had nearly completed their count of ballots in more than 1,600 counties – about half the country – and Trump’s share was up about 2 percentage points compared to 2020, reflecting a broad if not especially deep shift in Americans’ support for the president they ousted four years ago.He improved his numbers in suburban counties, rural regions and even some large cities that are historically bastions of Democratic support; in high-income counties and low-income ones; and in places where unemployment was comparatively high and in places where it is now at record lows.Harris had banked on big margins among urban and suburban voters, but her support in those places was running well behind President Joe Biden’s in the 2020 election.Nearly three-quarters of voters said American democracy is under threat, according to the exit polls, underscoring the depth of polarization in a nation where divisions have only grown starker during a fiercely competitive race.Trump employed increasingly apocalyptic rhetoric while stoking unfounded fears that the election system cannot be trusted. Harris warned that a second Trump term would threaten the underpinnings of American democracy.Hours before polls closed, Trump claimed on his Truth Social site without evidence that there was “a lot of talk about massive CHEATING” in Philadelphia, echoing his false claims in 2020 that fraud had occurred in large, Democratic-dominated cities. In a subsequent post, he also asserted there was fraud in Detroit.“I don’t respond to nonsense,” Detroit City Clerk Janice Winfrey told Reuters.A Philadelphia city commissioner, Seth Bluestein, replied on X, “There is absolutely no truth to this allegation.”DIZZYING CAMPAIGNTrump voted earlier near his home in Palm Beach, Florida.“If I lose an election, if it’s a fair election, I’m gonna be the first one to acknowledge it,” Trump told reporters.Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a prominent Trump backer, watched the results at Mar-a-Lago with Trump.Millions of Americans waited in orderly lines to cast ballots, with only sporadic disruptions reported across a handful of states, including several non-credible bomb threats that the FBI said appeared to originate from Russian email domains.Tuesday’s vote capped a dizzying race churned by unprecedented events, including two assassination attempts against Trump, Biden’s surprise withdrawal and Harris’ rapid rise.No matter who wins, history will be made.Harris, 60, the first female vice president, would become the first woman, Black woman and South Asian American to win the presidency. Trump, 78, the only president to be impeached twice and the first former president to be criminally convicted, would also become the first president to win non-consecutive terms in more than a century. \nThe Montreal Convention increases liability limits for death, injury, delays, baggage, and cargo issues for international air travel from December 28, 2024, protecting passenger rights and ensuring fair compensation.\nDuring Dashain, Nepali families gather, but both young and old are absorbed in their phones, resulting in diminished parent-child interaction, developmental delays, and increased vulnerability to cyber violence, particularly due to parental \"technoference.\"\nTorrential September rains in Nepal killed over 200, left thousands homeless, and caused extensive economic damage, with cleanup efforts still underway despite a lack of government assistance.\nFarmers in Nepal have increased their income significantly by growing round chillies, reducing crop loss due to animal damage and securing a stable market, with plans for a 60 million Nepalese rupee profit this year.\nNepal's PM Oli expresses dissatisfaction towards India, alleges interference and plans to raise concerns at the UN while blaming India for undermining his authority.\n\n\nRae was the envoy to Kathmandu during the promulgation of the 2015 constitution and the subsequent blockade. In this conversation, Rae talks about the evolution of Nepal-India ties since the blockade, regional geopolitics, what the two countries get wrong about each other, how New Delhi views Nepali communist parties and the governments they lead, and the change (if any) in India’s neighbourhood policy since the start of Narendra Modi’s third term in office. \nKunwar has been the MD for just under three years. Before coming back to her homeland to join Daraz Nepal, she worked at different American companies, including Amazon, the world’s biggest e-commerce platform.

The appointment followed the recommendation of the Council of Ministers and approval from the Parliamentary Hearing Committee, with the official announcement made on Wednesday.According to Archana Khadka, the information officer at the President’s Office, the President appointed Pandit as ambassador in accordance with Article 282 (1) of the Constitution. . Pandit will now assume the role of Nepal’s resident Ambassador to Israel.Parliamentary hearing committee endorsed Pandit as Nepal’s envoy to Israel two months ago.During his parliamentary hearing, Pandit expressed his intent to work towards peace in the ongoing Israel-Palestine conflict once he takes up his post. “Palestine also deserves to live,” he said, highlighting his commitment to advocating for peace in the region. \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli is known for his supposed ability to implement decisions and accomplish the tasks he takes up even at the cost of becoming unpopular.But a series of events after he became prime minister in mid-July tells a different story.In the three and half months since he assumed office at Singha Durbar, the prime minister has been compelled to backtrack on a couple of his plans or postpone them.In the first week of September, Prime Minister Oli pushed a plan to remove Deputy Speaker Indira Rana Magar from the post and elect a lawmaker from the ruling Nepali Congress in her place. According to multiple leaders privy to the development, by electing a Congress lawmaker as deputy speaker, Oli wanted to strengthen relations with the major coalition partner Congress, which has more seats than the prime minister’s party, the CPN-UML, in the House of Representatives. Congress chief Sher Bahadur Deuba has a special interest in getting a lawmaker from his party elected to the post, as deputy speaker is an ex-officio member of the Constitutional Council, which nominates members and heads of constitutional bodies.The prime minister on September 9 convened a meeting of the ruling parties and floated a proposal to remove Deputy Speaker Magar and sought a green signal from the coalition partners to his plan.After the meeting, party leaders told the Post that Prime Minister Oli proposed removing Deputy Speaker Magar from her position, citing conduct unbecoming of her office. Deputy Speaker Magar courted controversy after it emerged that she had requested visa interview dates from the US Embassy for individuals unrelated to her official role. On February 26 last year, Magar wrote to the US Embassy in Kathmandu requesting a visa interview for herself and five others. Two months later, the letter was leaked, and she was under pressure to step down.Last month, the prime minister held several meetings and consultations with a plan to introduce an ordinance to amend the Political Parties Act-2017 with an intention to facilitate party splits. This plan also drew widespread criticism as leaders from various political parties and independent observers accused the prime minister of plotting splits of fringe political parties with a plan to merge their dissident groups into the UML.His proposal to introduce ordinance was reportedly floated in order to merge the Ashok-Rai led Janata Socialist Party and the dissident group from the Madhav Nepal-led CPN (Unified Socialist), which in turn would make the UML the largest party in the House of Representatives.As the major coalition partner, the Congress, reportedly did not back his proposal to introduce the ordinance, Oli was again pushed to the back seat.These are just a few cases in point. Oli from the start of this tenure has struggled to assert his authority.Professor of political science Krishna Pokharel assesses that there may have been an understanding between Congress President Deuba and Prime Minister Oli to arrest Rastriya Swatantra Party President Rabi Lamichhane, who was accused of misappropriating cooperative funds, and issuing an ordinance related to political parties.Pokharel believes that the two leaders might have reached a deal to accomplish the two goals—bring an ordinance to facilitate the split of the CPN (Unified Socialist), which was formed in 2021 after breaking away from the UML; and arrest Lamichhane. Lamichhane, the immediate past home minister, had reportedly tried to arrest Congress chief Deuba’s spouse (current foreign minister) Arzu Rana Deuba, on charges of involvement in the Bhutanese refugee scam. “While the wish of the Congress chief was fulfilled, the interest of the UML chair and the prime minister was not,” Pokharel said. However, the UML leaders don’t buy this argument. Vice-chair Yubaraj Gyawali said that the government under UML leadership has just completed its 100 days, so it is too early to judge its performance. “There are many good initiatives taken by this government whose results will come in due course,” Gyawali told the Post. “Everything that the head of the government wants cannot be achieved in such a short period, but that does not mean his influence has waned.” But some political analysts say that Oli’s standing has declined since he became prime minister this time with the support of Congress, the largest party in Parliament. Oli dismisses those who claim his influence has gone down. While addressing the symposium on ‘Role of former security personnel in National Security and Development’ organised by the Nepal National Former Army and Police Association on October 27, Oli rubbished claims that his influence was steadily decreasing.“Those who claim my charm has decreased will know the reality in the 2027 election,” Oli said.Sarita Bhusal, a UML lawmaker, said a mistaken impression might have been created among the people. “Sometimes there are constraints to leading a coalition government,” Bhusal told the Post.Gyawali, a vice chair of the UML, agrees. “Earlier, Oli became prime minister with the support of smaller parties. But this time, he has the backing of the largest party in Parliament, so it is not easy for him to do all that he wants.” Oli first headed a coalition government after the promulgation of the constitution in 2015. When he became prime minister again in 2018 after the 2017 election, his party was the largest in the House. He became prime minister with the support of the Maoist Centre, which was his coalition partner during his previous stint as well.The Congress publicity department head, Min Bahadur Bishwakarma, said his party has been giving full support to the Oli government. “Our party has not opposed any government programme that is good for the country,” Bishwakarma told the Post. “We only caution the government on issues that may cause public backlash.”This government was formed in the spirit of a seven-point agreement between the two parties, and achieving those objectives must be its primary focus, Bishawakarma said. Of late, Oli has also faced criticism from within his party. Some UML leaders publicly opposed his recent decision to accept a donation from Min Bahadur Gurung, owner of Bhatbhateni Supermarket, for the construction of the party’s head office. Experts see it as a sign of his decreasing hold in the party organisation. Although party’s standing committee member Binda Pandey and central committee member Ushakiran Timilsina protested against it publicly, other party leaders are also reportedly dissatisfied with Oli’s decision.Bhim Rawal, who contested the election for chair against Oli during the party’s 10th general convention in Chitwan in November 2021, also criticised Oli for accepting the donation. Sidelined by Oli, Rawal is currently inactive in the party. Even leaders like Gokul Baskota, who used to be a staunch Oli supporter, couldn’t back him on the deal with businessman Gurung.In an interview with Image television, Baskota said, “The UML cannot accept Gurung’s donation and carry his old baggage.” On October 28, the Supreme Court issued an interlocutory interim order barring the ruling party, UML, from building any structure on the land donated by businessman Gurung. A single bench of Justice Sunil Kumar Pokharel said the UML-Gurung donation deal was illegal prima facie, putting Oli further on the defensive. \nAfter being ousted from government leadership on July 12, the CPN (Maoist Centre), the third largest party in the House of Representatives, finds itself in uncharted territory, facing a long spell out of power for the for the first time in nine years since the promulgation of the constitution in 2015. In a show of dissent, the party organised a protest rally in Kathmandu on October 26.As the main opposition party in the House, the Maoist Centre marked the new government’s 100th day with the protest rally, but its leaders say they have no specific programmes planned until the by-elections for the local level.The Election Commission is set to hold the by-elections for vacant seats in 39 local units on December 1. “Before the local-level by-election, our party may not organise any major event,\" Yubaraj Chaulagain, a Bagmati Province lawmaker and politburo member of the party, told the Post. “Now our focus will be on the by-elections.” Chaulagain also said that the party will convene a central committee meeting soon after the by-election to chart out the party's strategy ahead. Lekhanath Dahal, a federal lawmaker from the party, echoes Chaulagain, stating that while the party does not have any event, they were encouraged by public participation in their protest rally. He further adds that public interest in the Maoist Centre was evident from the turnout at the rally.“With the support of the people, we will come up with protest programmes against the steps taken by the current KP Sharma Oli-led government, which appears to be encouraging corruption and inefficient governance,” Dahal told the Post.Although Maoist Centre leaders assert that more people support their party because of their effective performance in the immediate past government, political analysts refuse to buy such claims. Like most other political parties, the Maoist Centre has also struggled with a lack of political agenda, which has caused a void in party activity, political analysts claim. “It is one thing to claim that the government under your leadership was better and more effective than others, but to claim that the Maoist Centre’s performance attracting the masses is farcical,” professor of political science Krishna Pokharel told the Post. In Pokhrel's opinion, the lack of a pro-people agenda has caused parties to drift away from the public. A clear example of this is their failure to come up with an effective programme for a long time, he said.Maoist Centre can provide a tough competition in the upcoming general elections if the party establishes itself as a strong opposition in Parliament, Pokharel adds.But the leaders of the Maoist center claim that it is wrong to say that they lack a pro-people programme and agenda. They say that they are working to reunite with the factions that split from the original Maoist party, to attract more public support.Since losing power, the Maoist center has made many efforts to strengthen itself, including reviving the Socialist Front. The party, which later forgot the Socialist Front that it created while in power, organised a meeting in July, right after losing power, and announced plans to reactivate it.However, with other parties affiliated to the Socialist Front focussed on their own internal issues, the front’s activities have stalled. The Front is an alliance of smaller, like-minded political parties with a socialist orientation.However, Lekhanath Dahal, the Maoist Centre leader, claims that the Socialist Front will hold a meeting soon. The Front’s meeting in July had formed a three-member task force to strengthen the front, and based on their recommendations, a full meeting will be scheduled soon. \nAs the government completes 100 days in office, some leaders from its major coalition partner, the Nepali Congress, have started to comment on the government’s performance—often unfavourably.Remarks by some key Congress leaders, particularly by senior Congress leader Shekhar Koirala, have alarmed a section of the governing parties. Congress is the largest party in the government led by KP Sharma Oli of the CPN-UML.Koirala, who contested for the post of party president and got defeated by Sher Bahadur Deuba three years ago, leads the anti-establishment faction in the party.Koirala has been raising critical questions against the government’s wrongdoings, causing apprehension among those in government. At times, he has even taken a stance against the government’s moves.For instance, Prime Minister Oli and Energy Minister Dipak Khadka are at loggerheads with Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) Managing Director Kul Man Ghising over whether or not to disrupt power supply to the companies defaulting in paying the NEA’s bills.In this prolonged dispute, Koirala has supported Ghising, who is backed by the main opposition, the CPN (Maoist Centre).Koirala was once a proponent of the Congress-UML coalition when Maoist Centre ditched the Congress to join hands with UML. He also played a role in forging an alliance with the UML to form a provincial government led by a Congress lawmaker in Koshi.Observers say that his latest stances are part of his strategy to present himself as a strong candidate for the party president in the next general convention, which should be held by the end of 2025 in accordance with the party statute.“It is possible that he is trying to establish himself as the main contender of the party leadership for the next convention, making the party rank and file believe that no other leaders can give alternatives to the party other than him,” Rajesh Gautam, a historian who has written multiple books on Congress, told the Post.As party president Sher Bahadur Deuba has already announced not to contest for the top post in the general convention, second-rung Congress leaders have already started making assumptions about the next leadership.Koirala, who lost to Deuba by a small margin for the party’s top post in 2021, is considered an untested leader because he hasn’t taken any key position in the party and has not even become a minister so far.Party leaders close to Koirala say that he was making comments based on the merit of the government’s performance.They say that by making such comments, Koirala has been trying to bring the government on the right track when it fumbles. Sometimes, he might seem harsh towards the government, but that is aimed at correcting the coalition and not toppling it, they argue.“Before Congress-UML came together to form the government, Koirala was one of the leaders who had advocated for the coalition of the two biggest parties,” Govindaraj Pokharel, a Congress leader close to Koirala, told the Post. “Therefore, as the proponent of the present coalition, he might have thought it was his moral duty to question the government if it cannot live up to its promise.”But Gautam differs.The performance of the government is below par and even the layman can find faults in its functioning, Gautam says.The Congress-UML government was formed in July based on a seven-point agreement, and its basic duty is to work to fulfill it. When the government deviates from its promised objectives to other issues, Pokharel says, Koirala sometimes becomes critical of the government to remind it of its objectives.In the recent party programme held on October 10, Koirala mentioned the three areas where the government had unnecessarily poked its nose: by not allowing the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) chief Kul Man Ghising to work as per his plan, by trying to unseat the Deputy Speaker Indira Magar Rana, and by planning to issue an ordinance related to Political Parties.Pokharel argues that Koirala has supported the government’s right move. When the government decided to constitute a high-level commission to recommend reforms to revitalise the ailing economy under the leadership of former finance secretary Rameshwar Khanal, Koirala welcomed it, Pokharel says.Apart from that, he adds, Koirala never criticised the government when it decided to take the tasks of the peace process ahead, pay the due amounts of sugarcane farmers, or form a committee to revitalise the country's tourism sector. However, the wrong act of the government should be questioned, and even though he is a leader from the coalition partner and he is not mincing words, Pokharel says.Jeevan Pariyar, a Congress joint general secretary, also says that Koirala's opinion on holding the government accountable should not be misinterpreted.“However, the government is still to fulfill its promises,” Pariyar told the Post.Two days ago, the government decided to provide free cancer treatment for children below 14 years of age at government hospitals. Pariyar describes it as a latest example of the positive initiatives taken by the government.Minister for Health and Population Pradip Paudel decided on Sunday to provide free cancer treatment for children below 14 years of age at Kanti Children’s Hospital, Bhaktapur Cancer Hospital and BP Koirala Memorial Cancer Hospital Bharatpur.There is no point in getting disappointed by the government since it has only completed 100 days, Pariyar says.However, some Congress leaders think the government is not working as per their expectation.In Monday’s meeting of the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee under the House of Representatives, Congress lawmaker Hirdayaram Thani raised several questions to Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak, a Congress leader, about the home ministry’s performance.“Where has the investigation on the irregularities on Giri Bandhu tea estate reached?” Thani questioned Home Minister Lekhak. The Giri Bandhu land scam is linked to Prime Minister Oli and Congress, which officially made its position clear through its parliamentary party meeting on May 14 and demanded an investigation into the decision-making process of the land swap permit. Thani also asked the home minister why investigations on various other corruption scams weren’t moving ahead satisfactorily.Pokharel, the Congress leader, says questioning the government does not mean the Congress leader does not favour this coalition government.“The duty of leaders who are representing the party in the government is to do better work,” Pokharel says. “It is also the duty of leaders out of the government to question it to make it accountable to the people.” \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City has designated 47 locations for floriculturists and flower vendors to sell flowers in Tihar.The city office’s move aims to avoid the inconvenience the floral vendors faced last year and reduce congestion on the sidewalks.“This year, we have designated 47 locations, most of them in shopping malls, marts, parks and party palaces,” said Dharma Raj Bhandari, a police inspector at the city office. “Farmers and vendors can take their products to those designated places and do business at their convenience. Our staff will help them reach the designated areas if they can not do so on their own.”Last year, many floral farmers from the adjoining districts of the Kathmandu Valley who brought flowers in the capital city could not sell their products due to restrictions the city office imposed in many places.The farmers were then allowed to sell flowers at Bhrikutimandap, Tinkune park, Handigaun and Balaju Valley Cold Store in coordination with the Floriculture Association of Nepal and the Nepal Chamber of Commerce. However, farmers and vendors discarded piles of flowers and garlands on footpaths and returned home, incurring heavy losses.The metropolis had deployed its staffers, including the metropolis police, to collect discarded flowers and garlands, which were dumped at the landfill site in Bancharedanda.Officials say that the malls, party palaces and parks will not charge farmers and vendors for providing space for selling flowers and garlands. KMC officials discussed the matter with the owners of the malls and party palaces and requested them to provide spaces for farmers to sell flowers and garlands in Tihar.“Floral farmers and vendors can sell flowers from other private places, but we will not allow them to obstruct footpaths,” said Laxmi Maharjan, a senior assistant sub-inspector of the KMC. “This year, we designated specified sales points in advance to avoid repeating last year’s situation.”The metropolis has also requested that people use flowers produced by Nepali farmers in Tihar and prohibit the sale, storage, distribution and use of plastic bouquets and flowers.“We have already confiscated plastic bouquets and flowers from many places,” said Maharjan. “We will fine traders if they ignore our warnings.”The metropolis has asked floral farmers and vendors to call the hotline 1180 or 015901763 and 9851356509 for help. \nTen people were injured in a bus accident at Ghumaune in Kharipati of Bhaktapur district on Tuesday. Two are reportedly in critical condition.According to Pradeep Khatri, a traffic police inspector and chief of the District Traffic Police Range, the bus coming from Talakot of Changunarayan Municipality lost its control and hit a pole. The injured are undergoing treatment at Bhaktapur Hospital, police said. \nTraffic police have reintroduced the no-horn campaign in Kathmandu Valley to combat unnecessary honking.Officers carrying placards with “no-horn” messages are stationed at various intersections, urging drivers to refrain from honking.Deputy Superintendent of Police Rabin Karki, spokesperson for the Kathmandu Valley Traffic Police Office, said the campaign aims to curb noise pollution through stricter enforcement and public awareness.Despite Kathmandu being declared a horn-free zone in April 2017, rampant horn use continues. Karki said the Vehicle and Transport Management Act prohibits honking in restricted areas, classifying it as a traffic violation.Last fiscal year, 10,123 vehicles were fined for unnecessary honking. This year, 13,003 vehicles have already faced penalties. The awareness drive was relaunched on October 17.Karki explained that while normal hearing can tolerate up to 60 decibels, 70 decibels is harmful. Noise pollution causes hearing loss, high blood pressure, heart disease, strokes, respiratory issues, and memory loss. Loud motorcycles and vehicles with modified silencers or pressure horns are major contributors. The police are focusing on violators, with particular attention to the impact on pedestrians, especially children, the elderly, pregnant women, and those with health issues, Karki said. \nAs the Kathmandu Valley’s air quality is set to deteriorate in the coming days, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City is gearing up to start vehicle emission testing.For this, the city office has purchased a smoke meter (a portable device for testing vehicle emissions), which will be used in coordination with other stakeholders—the Metropolitan Traffic Police Division, the Department of Transport Management, and the Department of Environment.“Vehicle emission testing is mainly the responsibility of the agencies under the federal government, but the constitution has also given local governments the authority to take measures to reduce pollution,” said Sarita Rai, chief of the Environment Department. “We also have developed pollution control guidelines as per the KMC Environment and Natural Resources Protection Act-2021.”Officials say vehicle emission testing will start once the pollution control guidelines are published in the metropolis gazette. In the first phase, emissions of petrol and diesel vehicles operating in the metropolis will be randomly tested, and the city office has also planned to carry out emission testing for motorcycles.Emission testing will be carried out on vehicles that have passed emission testing from the Department of Transport Management and received green stickers. Officials say that vehicles with green stickers could still emit black smoke for various reasons, including lack of timely servicing and maintenance.“We have seen many vehicles with green stickers emitting black smoke,” an official at the Environment Department of the KMC said, asking not to be named as the official is not authorised to talk to the media. “Many automobile owners only service their vehicles ahead of the annual pollution testing.” Officials say that the amount of the fine will be determined based on the suggestions of stakeholders.Vehicle emission testing is among the measures the city office has been taking to reduce pollution levels in the metropolis.The KMC has also started independently monitoring the city's air quality, with support from the Partnership for Healthy Cities, which has provided 19 portable devices to the city office.The Partnership for Healthy Cities is a global network of 74 cities, including the Kathmandu metropolis, committed to saving lives by preventing noncommunicable diseases and injuries. The programme is supported by Bloomberg Philanthropies in partnership with the World Health Organisation and Vital Strategies.Nepal’s air quality reaches hazardous levels several times a year during winter and summer, and the capital city often ranks as the world’s most polluted metropolis. Major hospitals also report a spike in respiratory problems due to the impact of toxic air and dust. Doctors warn that people get sick from respiratory illnesses caused by polluted air throughout the year, due to polluted air.Doctors say air pollution is known to cause various respiratory illnesses. Poor air quality can cause short- and long-term effects on public health. In the short term, it can lead to pneumonia, bronchitis, conjunctivitis, skin allergy, stroke, and heart problems, and in the long run it can lead to severe conditions like ulcers, and cancer of the lungs and intestine, kidney disease, and heart complications.People in low- and middle-income countries get disproportionately affected by the polluted air, which accounts for more than 90 percent of deaths, according to the World Health Organisation.Several studies carried out in the past in Nepal show that toxic air takes a huge toll on public health. Along with respiratory illness, the toxic air has led to severe conditions like ulcers, cancer of the lungs and intestine, kidney disease, heart complications, high blood pressure and stroke, according to experts.The report, titled “Global burden and strength of evidence for 88 risk factors in 204 countries and 811 subnational locations, 1990–2021: A systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2021,” finds that air pollution was the leading contributor to the global disease burden in 2021, making for eight percent of total disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), followed by high blood pressure (7.8 percent). The report was published in The Lancet, a leading international medical journal.Studies carried out in the past show that polluted air has been shortening people’s lives. Nepali lives are being cut short by around five years, according to a report by the Air Quality Life Index (AQLI), which converts air pollution concentration into an impact on life expectancy. AQLI is a metric produced by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago.Toxic air is deadlier than tobacco use and high blood pressure, which reduce life by 2.8 years and 1.7 years, respectively, according to the report.Environment experts in Nepal often point out that worsening air quality has not only affected people’s health but also hit the economy and hindered overall development of the country. \nTicket bookings for public transport during the Dashain festival will open this Saturday. Following discussions with stakeholders, the Department of Transport Management announced that tickets will be available online and at counters to manage the expected surge of nearly two million travellers leaving the Kathmandu Valley for the festivities.According to the department’s Director General, Rajiv Pokharel, transport operators will facilitate online bookings. “We have instructed operators to arrange online bookings wherever possible,” he said. “For counter bookings, passengers must obtain tickets only from official staff wearing uniforms and identification badges.”Around two million people are estimated to leave the Kathmandu Valley during Dashain. The department has introduced 20-point directives to ensure safe and hassle-free travel. Key measures include mandatory checks for alcohol consumption by drivers at major entry and exit points and the requirement for two drivers on long-distance routes. Additionally, those under 18 cannot work as assistant drivers.To assist travellers during Dashain, Tihar, and Chhath festivals, citizen help desks will be established at major locations such as Nagdhunga, Kalanki, Swayambhu, Halchowk, Machhapokhari, Gongabu Bus Park, Chabahil, Tilganga, Koteshwar, Jagati, Satdobato, Balkhu, Dakshinkali, Sundhara, and Sangha in Kavre. An inspection team comprising officials from various agencies will monitor travel arrangements with support from provincial transport ministries.Public transport operating on long and medium-distance routes must follow a designated queue system. Transport expert Ashish Gajurel noted that although bookings are open each year, passengers face difficulties. \"Bus operators don’t increase the number of buses during Dashain, despite rising demand. Authorities must increase the number of buses to ease travel,\" he said.Saroj Sitaula, senior vice-president of the Federation of Nepalese National Transport Entrepreneurs, however, argued that ‘unnecessary’ vehicle checks should be avoided to prevent inconvenience for passengers and drivers. He also highlighted the need to repair potholes on roads to ensure smooth travel.Earlier, Minister for Physical Infrastructure and Transport Devendra Dahal instructed the Department of Roads to complete road repairs nationwide before Ghatasthapana, the first day of the 15-day Dashain festival. The department reported that repairs are underway but have been delayed by the monsoon.The Narayanghat-Butwal road section, part of the East-West Highway, remains a major concern, with only 52.7 percent of its upgrade completed after six years of construction and multiple deadline extensions. The Meteorological Forecasting Division of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology has predicted chances of rainfall in various places of the country for a couple of days more, raising concerns about travel difficulties during Dashain. Other problematic sections include Nagdhunga-Mugling and Mugling-Pokhara, with landslides and potholes reported along various highways, including the Mid-Hill, Madan Bhandari, Hulaki, and BP highways. \nThe work on constructing a 24.5-metre-high dam for the 100MW Super Trishuli Hydropower Project on the Trishuli river, the largest private sector undertaking, has started.This is also the first run-of-river project in Nepal that will not require a tunnel.The powerhouse will be built at the bottom of the dam in the Trishuli basin. The plant consists of three turbines, two each with 33.33 MW output and one with the 33.4MW optimum capacity.Project developer Blue Energy is said to have started diverting water to build the dam between Butar of Gandaki Municipality, Gorkha, and Chumlingtar of Ichhakamana Municipality, Chitwan.The four-year project started in March 2023.Blue Energy said this would be the first project in Nepal that will need no tunnel to channel dam water as the powerhouse in Butar of Gorkha will be close by.“Around 20 percent of work was completed before Dashain. The work is making satisfactory progress,” said Niranjan Regmi, director of Blue Energy.The total investment is Rs16 billion. As construction is going on in a major river, floods in the rainy season can obstruct work.In the monsoon gone by, Regmi said, massive flooding swept away machinery, transport vehicles, and construction materials. He said the company faced around Rs200 million in damages, particularly in the late September floods.Five barrages will be constructed to discharge the water, said Dibya Raj Panta, the project's geologist. Each barrage is 12-metre high and 5-metre-wide.Normally, the Trishuli river’s flow is 600 cubic metres per second. At the past monsoon’s end, the water flow was measured at 5,000 cusec.The dam has been designed to withstand a maximum flow of 9,800 cusec.Fish ladders will be constructed in one of the five dams to mitigate the impact on the fish populations. The specialised structures are designed to facilitate fish movement through the barriers, allowing them uninterrupted migration routes.After the dam is built, a lake will be formed in Phisling, Chitwan, extending 3.5 km upstream.The electricity produced is proposed to be connected to the national grid in Marki Chowk of Abu Khaireni, Tanahun, 18 km from the project site. “If the transmission line is constructed in the nearby areas before the project's completion, it will be connected to it,” said Panta.The company obtained the survey licence in 2009.Before the earthquake in 2015, a Chinese company was appointed the project contractor. However, due to Covid-19, the work was stalled.The project for civil and hydromechanical works was awarded to CE Construction Pvt Ltd. The deal involves planning, design, engineering and construction. Electro-mechanical works are being done by GE Power India Ltd.Except for the dam, all the project structures are on the Gorkha side at Butar.The project, however, has courted controversy.Himalayan Gorkha Outdoor Resort Private Limited, which is close to the project, has claimed that it incurred losses of Rs50 million in the September flood due to the project. The resort is currently closed.There was a rock hill 200 metres from the resort. “The project removed it, triggering a current to the resort, which caused the damage,” said Mahendra Singh Thapa, the resort's director. He has demanded compensation from the project.“The shutdown of the resort will cause us losses of Rs5 million annually,” said Thapa.Blue Energy officials have denied responsibility for the losses. “The rainfall was unexpected, and the flood was massive. We, too, suffered damages worth millions,” he said.The story has been updated to clarify a point on the project's construction. \nThe 220kV Chilime-Trishuli transmission line project has been completed after seven years of construction. This crucial development in the energy sector is expected to open the doors to electricity trade with China. The Chilime-Trishuli transmission line links two locations: Chilime, a small village close to the Chinese border in the north of Kathmandu in Rasuwa district, and Trishuli, a smaller town in Nuwakot district. According to the Nepal Electricity Authority, this transmission line project is extremely important for Nepal because it will benefit electricity producers and facilitate power trading with the northern neighbour, China.Kulman Ghising, managing director of the Nepal Electricity Authority, said in a statement issued on Monday, \"The Chilime-Kerung international transmission line will be built for electricity trade with China, the neighbouring country to the north. The Chilime-Trishuli transmission line will serve as a link to China.”During the then prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s visit to China in September last year, the two sides signed an agreement to develop the Nepal section of the proposed 220kV Jilong/Kerung-Rasuwagadhi-Chilime cross-border transmission line with a Chinese grant.“The two sides will launch the construction of the Jilong/Kerung-Rasuwagadhi-Chilime 220kV cross-border power transmission line at an early date,” according to the joint statement issued during the visit.The two sides agreed to build the first transmission line connecting the two neighbours. Currently, without grid connectivity with China, Nepal relies solely on India for importing electricity during the dry season and exports its surplus power during the wet season.Around a dozen cross-border transmission lines are already in operation, including one with 400kV capacity to India, while four other 400kV cross-border grids extending southwards are in the pipeline.According to the NEA officials, the Nepal section is 16 km from the China border to the Chilime hub, while the Chinese will need to construct around 80 km from its side to the border.This project is designed to evacuate electricity generated from the Trishuli River basin, marking a significant milestone in Nepal's energy infrastructure.This is the key power evacuation project that would benefit the projects, including the 216MW Upper Trishuli-1, 60MW Upper Trishuli 3A, and the 36MW Upper Trishuli 3B hydroelectric projects. The transmission line would also evacuate power from the 14.6MW Upper Sanjen, 42.5MW Sanjen, 111MW Rasuwagadhi, 14.3MW Upper Mailung, and 5MW Upper Mailung A hydroelectric projects.The 28 km Chilime-Trishuli 220 kV double circuit electricity transmission line has 76 pylons. “The facility would evacuate power from the 111MW Rasuwagadhi Hydropower Project and 42.5MW Sanjen Hydropower Project, both built under the authority's subsidiary company, Chilime Jalvidyut,” said Ghising, adding that the Rasuwagadhi and Sanjen projects have been completed and are in the power generation stage.“This transmission line will also help many other hydropower projects under construction in the area.”\"Erecting a pylon was challenging in many areas. The mountainous terrain meant many places did not have roads, so people or mules had to carry conduction materials like stones, sand, water and pylon parts. Additionally, floods and landslides, forest clearance, local obstacles and Covid-19 also created hurdles,” said Ghising. According to the NEA, 33 pylons had to be constructed in places without access roads.“Despite all odds, we have completed the project through our continuous efforts,” said Ghising.Tharka Bahadur Thapa, chief of the grid operation department of the NEA, said the project built more than 20 kilometres of access roads.He said that nine pylons were constructed by transporting construction materials and equipment by mules and people, while two were built by transporting construction materials by helicopter. In most mountain areas, drones were used to connect the overhead line cables from one pylon to another. The 65 million euro (approximately Rs9.49 billion as per Monday’s exchange rate) project was jointly financed by the German government through its Development Bank KfW (grant of 14 million euro), European Investment Bank (loan of 25 million euro), the European Union under its Asia Investment Facility (2.25 million euro) and the rest by Nepal government.In October 2017, Chinese firm Pinggao Group of Companies was awarded the contract to build the transmission line and substation. The transmission line project includes the construction of the 220/132 kV Trishuli 3B hub substation, the 220/132 kV Chilime substation, and the Chilime-Trishuli 220 kV double-circuit transmission line.The transmission line has been constructed at elevations ranging from 680 to 2,600 metres above sea level.  \nWithout appropriate intervention on universal access to safe drinking water, sanitation and adequate hygiene (WASH) services, the number of malaria and dengue cases in Nepal could increase by up to 27 percent and 44 percent, respectively, over 2011–2040, according to the new study of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) released on Thursday. The report recommended that Developing Asia be made more committed to tackling climate change.Based on a 2023 study supported by the ADB, over 2041–2070, case numbers could rise by as much as 69 percent for malaria and 113 percent for dengue. However, the study said better access to drinking (tap) water and improved household waste management can reduce disease risks by eliminating informal water storage that serves as mosquito breeding sites.The study also showed that Nepal’s investments to reach the Sustainable Development Goals on water and sanitation and improving waste management could reduce infections from malaria by 17 percent and from dengue by 41 percent in urban areas. “Improving WASH services can also deliver other health benefits, such as lessening diarrhoeal disease and increasing good hygiene practices, as well as helping to build resilience to vector-borne diseases.”The ADB research finds the impacts of climate change could reduce gross domestic product (GDP) in developing Asia and the Pacific by 17 percent by 2070 under a high-end greenhouse gas emissions scenario, rising to 41 percent by 2100.Rising sea levels and falling labour productivity would cause the most significant losses, with lower incomes and fragile economies hardest hit. The new research in the inaugural issue of ADB’s Asia-Pacific Climate Report details a series of damaging impacts threatening the region. The report said that if the climate crisis continues to accelerate, up to 300 million people in the region could be threatened by coastal inundation, and trillions of dollars of coastal assets could be damaged annually by 2070.The Sixth Assessment Report of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projects that the risk of vector-borne diseases (e.g., malaria and dengue) will increase if individual economies do not take climate change adaptation measures. Due to increased temperatures and altered weather patterns, more localities will become suitable breeding grounds for disease vectors, such as mosquitoes.“Climate change has supercharged the devastation from tropical storms, heat waves, and floods in the region, contributing to unprecedented economic challenges and human suffering,” said ADB President Masatsugu Asakawa. “Urgent, well-coordinated climate action that addresses these impacts is needed before it is too late.”The report finds that regional public sentiment supports climate action. In an ADB climate change perception study this year, 91 percent of respondents across 14 regional economies said they view global warming as a serious problem, with many seeking more ambitious government action. To address growing climate risks, adaptation responses need to be accelerated, and adaptation-focused climate finance must be greatly upscaled.The report values annual investment needs for regional countries to adapt to global warming at between $102 billion and $431 billion—far exceeding the $34 billion of tracked adaptation finance in the region in 2021–2022. On the mitigation front, the report shows that the region is well placed to embrace renewable energy and drive a transition to net zero and that forging ahead with domestic and international carbon markets can help achieve climate action goals cost-effectively.Investments in WASH can help reduce health risks exacerbated by climate change. The report said that agriculture is vulnerable to increased frequency of extreme climatic events due to climate change. However, achieving goals under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change is likely to depend on expanding carbon sequestration through forests, limiting land availability for agriculture.In most Paris Agreement-compatible emissions pathways scenarios, bioenergy use rises, often combined with carbon capture and storage. Bioenergy production also reduces the land area available for growing food crops.The report said that in 2023, the ADB released a study that models a set of scenarios compatible with the Paris Agreement, then contrasts these scenarios with current policies. This modelling considers both the deployment of bioenergy and expanded forest cover and other energy-related mitigation options. The Paris Agreement compatible scenarios find that the land area for growing food crops in developing Asia will decrease by 36 million hectares by 2050 and 58 million hectares by 2070. Much of this is driven by the expansion of bioenergy crops, which will reach 97 million hectares in the region by 2070. As a result, food prices will reach values 35 percent higher than they would be under current policies by 2065.“Agriculture, therefore, clearly needs adaptation to emissions mitigation policies, as well as to the impacts of climate change, to avoid adverse food security outcomes,” the report said. Climate change will lead to new disease burdens, including new and emerging climate-related vector-borne diseases (e.g., chikungunya, dengue). The G20 High-Level Independent Panel calls for more robust disease surveillance and detection networks, coordinated regional action and information sharing.This will require a significant expansion of surveillance networks and the development of global, regional, and national expertise. Embodied agricultural innovations, including stress-tolerant varieties, can help address climate shifts using existing extension systems. Agricultural research has a key role in adaptation, and related studies provide very positive cost-benefit ratios for investing in research to address climate change risks. High-returns research products include stress-tolerant crop varieties, especially for drought and floods. They require transmission of much more information among farmers. More iterative and interactive extension approaches, such as farmer field schools, demand responsive approaches, such as farmer contracted extension, and gender-sensitive approaches all show promise to improve the adoption of knowledge-intensive practices, according to the report.As climate change may affect the energy sector, the report said there is potential to build climate resilience into energy supply. The Asia and Pacific region is receiving some of the most significant flows of investment into energy supply, with an increasing share of this investment being in green and renewable energy. However, this new infrastructure is vulnerable to climate change, especially given its long lifetime, and it is important to address these climate risks during design, a concept known as ‘climate-proofing’.“Doing so involves low additional costs and is highly cost-effective, generating benefits four times greater than the costs,” the report said.Several smaller economies, including Bhutan, Nepal, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan, generate most of their electricity (86 percent-100 percent) through hydropower.According to the report, substantial investments are needed in generation capacity and energy storage, grid enhancement, and smart grid technologies to manage the intermittent nature of sources such as wind and solar energy and achieve net zero emissions.Meanwhile, the extensive hydropower resources in developing Asia can support grid stability as wind and solar power capacity increases, and enhanced grid interconnection can help mitigate intermittency challenges further.However, effective climate-proofing often requires enabling actions by the government, including changes to design standards.Nepal’s second Nationally Determined Contribution, or NDC, is each country's national climate action plan under the Paris Agreement. The submission provides more details than the first plan. It includes quantified targets for agriculture, energy, forestry, and waste and a commitment to gender equality and social inclusion by empowering women, Indigenous people, and youth in climate policy.Despite these updates, the report said that NDC commitments across developing Asia remain insufficient to align with the Paris Agreement goals.The report said that 44 economies of developing Asia with submitted NDCs all include targets for the energy sector. Still, only 40 include targets for the agriculture, forestry, and other land use sectors.Moreover, just 30 economies have targets for the industry sector despite this sector's crucial role in decarbonisation.Forty- four economies, representing 98 percent of the region’s emissions, have ratified the 2015 Paris Agreement and submitted nationally determined contributions (NDCs) with commitments to cut GHG emissions and adapt to climate change.In addition, 36 of these economies have announced or adopted net-zero targets. However, according to the report, current actions fall short of what is needed to limit the global temperature rise to 2°C or, ideally, 1.5°C.The NDCs and net zero targets lack concrete, sector-specific emission reduction road maps.Implementing decarbonisation plans faces key challenges, including institutional capacity gaps, governance issues, insufficient financing, limited access to technology and expertise, and vulnerability to climate events that divert resources from decarbonisation efforts.The ADB climate change perception survey conducted in 2024 finds that 91 percent of people in 14 economies in developing Asia view climate change as a severe problem. Additionally, 84 percent of respondents report that they and their families are already experiencing climate change impacts or expect to within the next decade.  \n\nA team of senior health officials from the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, who were deployed recently in Gandaki Province to assess the latest situation of the dengue spread, returned with complaints. Along with health workers serving at local bodies and provincial hospitals, elected representatives and local leaders of political parties, with whom they discussed, complained about exorbitant testing charges at private laboratories.“We are aware of the excessive prices being charged by private labs for dengue testing and held discussions about setting a maximum price but couldn't reach a decision,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director at the division. “For the next dengue season, we would make a decision about slashing the testing charges.”Nepal has been witnessing a rapid surge in new cases of dengue infection in recent months. Health authorities, however, do not concede that the number of new dengue cases is rising alarmingly. Doctors say there could be dengue patients in almost all households, especially in the Kathmandu Valley and in major cities like Pokhara.Officials say that state-run health facilities do not charge for dengue testing, and they are aware of excessive charging by private labs despite the significant decline in the cost of rapid diagnostic test kits.“It cost less than 100 rupees for a rapid diagnostic testing kit, but private labs have been charging excessively,” an official at the Department of Health Services said, asking not to be named, as he is not authorised to speak to the media. “Due to a lack of regulation, private labs and hospitals have been fleecing patients, and health officials have been avoiding making decisions to appease the private laboratories and hospitals.”Public health experts say that it was obvious for patients to bear brunt when the authorities concerned, including the health minister, focus on gaining popularity by announcing populist programmes that are not feasible to implement with existing resources.“Some hospitals have been charging up to Rs 3,000 for dengue tests,” said Dr Baburam Marasini, a public health expert. “When the authorities forget their prime duties and fear antogonising private hospitals and labs, it is inevitable that patients will suffer.”Most state run health facilities and labs remained closed during Tihar holidays, which forced infected patients to seek services at private hospitals. Meanwhile, the Department of Health Services said that its attention has been drawn to the excessive charging for dengue testing at private labs.“I have noted the issue and will discuss it with the Health Ministry,” said Dr Bikash Devkota, director general at the Department of Health Services. “We will make some decisions regarding this issue.”Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika viruses, according to the World Health Organisation.So far, only 12 people have died, and over 29,000 have been infected since the start of 2024 if the government data is to be believed. Experts say reported dengue cases may only represent a small fraction of the true scale of the outbreak, as around 90 percent of the infected people do not show any symptoms and health authorities often concealed the actual number of deaths and infections.As there is no specific treatment for dengue, health workers provide symptomatic care and diagnose patients based on symptoms, including platelet-rich plasma transfusion.According to doctors, mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes are some symptoms of dengue.The World Health Organisation (WHO) says there is no specific treatment for severe dengue, but early detection and access to proper medical care can save lives. \nIn rural Madhesh, where cultural norms and limited access to healthcare compound an already fragile health infrastructure, women’s sexual and reproductive health needs are often sidelined.For many women there, awareness of their own bodies and health needs remains a distant reality. Seeking help for sexual and reproductive health (SRH) issues is often a last resort.Seema Kumari Pasman, a 20-year-old from Karmahi village in Dhanusha who the Post is identifying with a pseudonym for privacy, is one such example.Married at 16 in 2019, she quickly became a mother of two children by 2022.After two child births, her menstrual complications worsened, yet she had no frame of reference to understand that what she was experiencing—menorrhagia, or abnormally heavy bleeding—was a medical condition.Pasman endured a year of painful, prolonged periods that she had been taught were simply part of a woman’s life—a burden, not a condition needing treatment.Daily chores became unbearable for her but those around her continued to dismiss her symptoms.One night in December 2023, after collapsing while fetching water from a hand pump, Pasman’s family rushed her to Janakpur Provincial Hospital.There, doctors diagnosed her with severe anaemia from untreated menorrhagia. “The doctors told me that if I had received earlier intervention, my suffering could have been prevented...but I only thought it was normal,” Pasman says.The culture of silence around SRH issues means that women like Pasman get help only when their conditions are critical.A 2018 study in the Journal of Health and Allied Sciences reported low awareness of SRH rights among 384 married Madheshi women in Sarlahi. Three-fifths were unaware of these rights, and the same proportion reported experiences of physical and dowry-related violence.Chandra Rekha Issar, a gynaecologist at Janakpur Provincial Hospital and assistant professor at the Madhesh Institute of Health Sciences (MIHS), says that for many women, the concept of openly talking about SRH—especially with male doctors—is almost unthinkable.In rural Madhesh, as part of ‘ghunghat pratha’, married women have limited interaction with unrelated men outside their family. They are often expected to wear a veil in front of everyone except their husbands and rarely go outside alone for extended periods.This restrictive environment creates a hesitation among women to discuss their SRH. When these women visit a gynaecologist and are assigned a male doctor, it often leads to discomfort.Health consultations can thus become uncomfortable or are avoided altogether, exacerbating a pattern of undiagnosed and untreated conditions.At Janakpur Hospital, this cultural barrier plays out every single day.Kamala Devi Mandal, a 30-year-old woman from Khariyani, Janakpur, sat clutching her veil in the waiting area of the Department of Gynaecology, with her mother in law on the side.When her turn came, Mandal hesitated upon seeing a male gynaecologist, Raj Kishor Pandit, at the door. Despite a female attendant’s presence, Mandal’s mother-in-law ultimately did the talking, while Kamala remained silent, visibly uncomfortable.For Issar, these hesitations are all too familiar. She works alongside male gynaecologists in a department where only four of the 13 doctors are female.“In a setting where women are uncomfortable speaking about reproductive issues, especially with male doctors, we have to proceed carefully, often through the person accompanying the patient,” she says.Most of the female patients are accompanied by family members, as husbands are often working abroad.For something as basic as the date of their last menstrual cycle, the patient often defers to the person accompanying her. “Most of them are under a veil,” Issar added, “and removing it, even for an eye check to assess anaemia, takes coaxing… It requires long counselling for women to open up. At times, the information we receive is incomplete, which creates challenges in treatment.”If patients still hesitate to see a male gynaecologist after counselling, a female gynaecologist is assigned when possible, says Issar. However, this is often unfeasible during busy hours due to limited staff compared to the high patient load.Gynecologist Issar says that about 85 percent of the hospital’s gynaecology and obstetrics cases involve pregnancy-related complications, often worsened by malnutrition, lack of prenatal care, and early marriages.General gynaecology accounts for 15 percent of patients, with menstrual issues like dysmenorrhea and heavy bleeding common among adolescents under 19, while older patients face infections, cervical cancer, and uterine prolapse.Due to early marriages, multiple childbirths, and home deliveries without medical supervision, many women develop uterine prolapse—a condition typically seen in older women but increasingly common in those as young as 30 in rural Madhesh.The gendered expectations that govern interactions in rural Madhesh leave women ill-equipped to advocate for their health.“During a health camp in Saptari, I found that over ten percent of women under 35 had uterine prolapse,” Issar says. “Early marriage and childbirth in an environment without health education or postnatal care have serious consequences.”The barriers also include outdated beliefs and superstitions which affect women’s diet and recovery after childbirth.“Although the situation has improved, women in remote Madhesh are often prohibited from consuming protein-rich foods like chicken soup or meat after giving birth,” says 24 year old Sapana Ray, a bachelor’s student in public health at Madhesh Institute of Health Sciences. “They are typically allowed only one meal of roti and are discouraged from more water and meal, as it’s believed that this prevents colds and other illnesses in the child,” Ray added, “This lack of nutrition contributes to malnutrition and anaemia, exacerbating their health issues.”When rural women lack basic health literacy, common gynaecological issues go unchecked, leading to preventable complications. For instance, over 80 percent of cases at Janakpur Provincial Hospital are critical.“Most of these severe cases could have been prevented with early intervention or just an understanding of basic health,” Issar says.As Issar sees it, comprehensive awareness campaigns are crucial for educating women about sexual and reproductive health.“The government should consider monthly outreach programmes in rural areas. Women in far rural communities need direct, consistent health education,” Issar says. Further, local health posts with trained personnel could provide preventive care and answer questions women may hesitate to bring up in a hospital setting.The hospital’s efforts to include female attendants in male doctors’ consultations and to counsel women on gender-neutral healthcare only go so far. Often, patients’ deep-seated fears and hesitation prove challenging to overcome.While Madhesh’s women struggle with silence and a lack of resources, healthcare professionals are left piecing together fragmented stories, trying to heal patients who are often reluctant to share their suffering. It is a race against time and tradition.Dr Issar says that it’s unfair to blame women for hesitating to discuss their issues with gynaecologists. “We need to understand and empathise with their background,” she says.Many women, living in conservative settings, rarely have the freedom to speak openly. Given this, she questions, “How can we expect them to feel fully comfortable discussing their sexual and reproductive health, especially with a male doctor?” Even for educated urban women, she adds, these conversations can be challenging.According to Ray, consistent ground-level awareness and counselling programmes on SRH are essential, alongside changes to the conservative and predominantly patriarchal settings in rural areas. “These social barriers, even more than medical intervention, are often the primary obstacles to healthcare access for women in these communities,” she says. \nOfficers and employees at the Ministry of Health and Population and the Department of Health Services will receive training on coping with mental health problems.Officials hope that the training will help employees understand common mental health conditions and identify warning signs of depression, anxiety, stress and other psychological issues.“Employees are human beings too and can suffer from various health conditions, including mental health conditions,” said Dr Pomawati Thapa, chief of the Non-communicable Disease and Mental Health Section at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “We have planned to impart one-day training to the employees at the Health Ministry and the Department of Health Services.”Officials say that 80 of the 160 employees serving at the Health Ministry and at the Department of Health Services will receive training first, and the rest will receive it another day. They say the training would be provided to employees of other ministries only if they get positive results from the training imparted to Health Ministry officials.Studies carried out in the past show that the majority of government officials at Singha Durbar suffered from multiple health complications such as hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, kidney diseases, anxiety and depression. Health problems could have been exacerbated since the workplace environment hasn’t improved, the studies showed.Singha Durbar is the country’s federal administrative heart where most ministries and important government offices are located. Reports show that many civil servants are unaware of their health ailments.Doctors say a sedentary lifestyle, poor eating habits and stress contribute to the health crisis among government employees. They advise employees to visit a hospital if they feel something is wrong with their health.Of late, noncommunicable diseases have emerged as the leading killers in Nepal, and its reflection can also be seen among government employees.A 2019 study by the Nepal Health Research Council on the prevalence of noncommunicable diseases found that the diseases accounted for 71 percent of the country's deaths.The study shows that hypertension, diabetes, renal malfunction, liver problems, heart issues and cervical cancer are responsible for the majority of morbidity and mortality in Nepal.The findings showed that the leading risk factor of death in 2019 was smoking, whose attributable death was 17.7 percent, followed by high systolic blood pressure at 12.3 percent, household air pollution at 11.2 percent, ambient air pollution at 9.3 percent, diabetes at 8 percent, and high cholesterol and kidney dysfunction, among others.The study was primarily focused on behavioural risk factors, including tobacco and alcohol consumption, and biological risk factors—raised blood pressure, heavyweight, obesity, abnormal lipid prevalence, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes.To address the growing burden of non-communicable diseases, the government has previously announced that it will carry out free screening of non-communicable diseases of people over 40. However, the programme has not yet been started.Public health experts say the increase in non-communicable diseases is a global phenomenon, but developing countries like Nepal have been facing a double burden.They say that many lives can be saved if people are screened for non-communicable diseases for free. \nAs Minister for Health and Population Pradip Paudel is on a spree announcing one populist programme after another, health agencies under his ministry are reaching out to aid organisations for small amounts to basic training.Officials say they do not even have the budget to provide mental health screening training to children and adolescents, and this has delayed the planned programme.“We have been asking aid agencies for help to carry out training programmes for health workers,” an official at the Health Ministry said, asking not to be named as he is not authorised to speak to the media. “The minister is busy unveiling new free programmes but does not bother to learn about the real problems.”On Monday and Tuesday, Minister Paudel announced three free programmes that include free treatment for children under 14 with cancer, free treatment and health check-ups for women soccer players injured in matches, and upgrades to the Sailaja Acharya Heart Disease Centre in Biratnagar. Last week, Paudel pledged free care for poor burn victims who cannot afford treatment. However, most health facilities offering burn care provide only basic treatments, which often puts patients' safety at risk. Since taking office three months ago, Minister Paudel has announced several other populist programmes.While most of these initiatives—which include reducing hospital wait times, increasing government health insurance coverage to Rs500,000, and providing outpatient care on public holidays—have yet to be implemented, Paudel continues to announce more free programmes.Experts have questioned the effectiveness and sustainability of such programmes stating that previous ministers and governments would also have made similar decisions if there were simple solutions.“Only those who are unaware of the limitations and working style of our health system could be impressed by these populist announcements, but the reality is quite different,” said Sagar Rjbhandari, a health expert. Many other health programmes, including nutritious food for pregnant and nursing mothers and children in Karnali Province, as well as maternal and perinatal death surveillance, among others, have been affected by budget constraints in the current fiscal year.Health Ministry officials said they have requested UNICEF for financial help to impart mental health screening training of children for health workers.“We need around Rs700,000 to train health workers, including doctors, nurses, and paramedics, on mental health screening for children and adolescents,” said Dr Pomawati Thapa, chief of the Non-communicable Disease and Mental Health Section at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “UNICEF has responded positively to our request. A four-day screening training will be organised in the fourth quarter of the current fiscal year.”Officials said that they plan to train 150 health workers.“We hope that the health worker training will help reduce existing mental health problems among children and adolescents,” said Thapa. “Those serving in primary health care centres will be trained first to ensure that children and adolescents in villages will easily access the services.”A report from the National Mental Health Survey Nepal-2020 shows that the prevalence of mental disorders among adolescents was 5.2 percent that year, and neurotic and stress-related disorders were the most common at 2.8 percent.Likewise, the prevalence of current suicidal thoughts among adolescents was around four percent, while the rate of suicidal attempts in the same age group was 0.7 percent. The report also shows that 0.6 percent of children and adolescents were found to have been suffering from depression.The prevalence of suicidality, including current suicidal thoughts, lifetime suicidal attempts, and the future likelihood of suicidal thoughts, was found to affect 7.2 percent of the population.Experts say that mental health problems in children and adolescents could be several times more than what the survey portrays. They say that around 10 to 15 percent of the total children and adolescent population could have been suffering from various types of mental health issues, and due to methodological problems, the survey may not accurately portray the actual problems.Health officials say that there are only around half a dozen child and adolescent psychiatric doctors in the country, and only a few are serving in state-run health facilities. Similarly, the major contributors to the treatment gap are societal beliefs, traditions and stigma associated with mental disorders, according to experts.“This training will help health workers identify problems and refer patients to health facilities with child psychiatrists and psychologists,” said Thapa.Studies show the magnitude of suffering, the burden and costs for individuals, families and societies arising from mental health disorders are alarming in Nepal. \nDozens of children with severe urological birth defects and rare urological conditions in HCM City, Vinh, Hà Nội and Đà Nẵng are receiving free genital surgeries under the ‘Thiện Nhân & Friends’ programme – a project that offers child genital reconstruction surgeries in Việt Nam.Part of an annual programme that started 18 years ago, these surgeries are being performed from October 18 to November 9 by a volunteer medical team from Italy, England, Egypt and the UAE, led by Italian surgeon Dr Roberto De Castro.The surgeries take place at Children’s Hospital 2 in HCM City, the Nghệ An Obstetrics and Pediatrics Hospital in Vinh City, the National Pediatric Hospital and Việt Đức Hospital in Hà Nội, and the Đà Nẵng Children and Women’s Hospital in Đà Nẵng City.Over decades, Dr De Castro has performed pioneering surgical techniques to effectively treat genital malformations and injuries in both boys and girls to allow them to live full lives.One of De Castro’s biggest success stories is Phùng Thiện Nhân, who was abandoned by his biological mother at birth in a remote area in the central province of Quảng Nam. When Nhân was found three days later, he was barely alive and had lost most of his genitals and one leg due to a brutal attack by wild animals.The infant survived the incident and was subsequently adopted by journalist Trần Mai Anh, moving to Hà Nội with his new family. With the support of De Castro, Thiện Nhân received successful reconstructive surgery in January 2011.His foster mother, Mai Anh, later became the founder of the ‘Thiện Nhân & Friends’ programme which, together with the Asia Injury Prevention (AIP) Foundation, pays for surgeries, travel costs and medical supplies for poor Vietnamese children needing genital reconstruction.Over the years, the ‘Thiện Nhân & Friends’ programme has conducted 630 surgeries, examinations and diagnoses for 2,000 children, with another 1,000 patients still awaiting treatment.Dozens of leading experts in paediatric reconstructive and urological surgery from around the world have participated in the programme. In Việt Nam, along with conducting examinations and surgeries, the international specialists also hold scientific workshops and hands-on training sessions with Vietnamese medical staff, sharing their experiences and introducing the latest advanced methods in paediatric urological surgery.According to founder of the AIP Foundation and co-founder of the ‘Thiện Nhân & Friends’ programme Greig Craft, the mission of the progamme is not just to treat a small number of children with genital disabilities.“By spreading the inspiration to live and sharing medical knowledge as leading experts come together, we believe that the impact will extend beyond the confines of the programme. We are fortunate that Thiện Nhân, our first patient, shares this vision and has chosen to become a scientist in the future,” he said.Eighteen years after being found in the jungle and given a second chance at life, Thiện Nhân has entered university. He chose the field of Artificial Intelligence, believing that “AI has the potential to revolutionise healthcare and improve the lives of many people, just as my life was transformed through medical intervention”. From these 18 years of experience, the young man is convinced that “empathy and patience will lead to miraculous achievements”.-In Association with ANN \nDusit Princess Kathmandu is organising a five-day trout festival at its SOI restaurant. The dishes will be available for order from 12:30 pm to 10:00 pm every day till August 30. In celebration of Nepal’s rivers and lakes, which provide an ideal environment for high-quality trout, the Director of Culinary Food and Beverage Service, Chef Utpal Mondal, and his team at Dusit Princess Kathmandu have crafted a menu showcasing the flavours and versatility of locally sourced trout. “As the festive month of Shrawan ends, people focus on healthy and nutritious food. Trout, rich in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and essential minerals, offers a heart-friendly option that checks all the boxes from a nutritional and culinary standpoint,” says Mondal.He adds that the goal of the culinary event is to offer their guests a rare opportunity to experience a wide variety of trout dishes they wouldn’t typically find at home.The event menu features twelve unique dishes, six of which are drawn from diverse culinary traditions across continents. Three dishes are inspired by oriental cuisine, while the remaining three highlight flavours from Nepal and India. The menu has been designed to include various dishes, from soups and starters to main courses, including Mexican, Italian, Continental, and Thai flavours.While discussing the event’s highlights, Mondal said, “The celebration presents a unique opportunity for guests to indulge in a diverse range of trout-based dishes, something they wouldn’t typically have the chance to experience elsewhere.” \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nNepal wrapped up their turbulent year in the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup League 2 with a point against Scotland after their match was called off due to bad weather on Monday.Nepal were looking to complete a double against the Scots after thrashing them by five wickets in the first leg of the United States Tri-Series that also helped them register their first League 2 win in eight months.The Rhinos were invited to field first after losing the toss in a rain-delayed match at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas, the United States, but the play was suspended again when the Rhinos were at 26-1 in six overs. The match was then officially called off due to lightning and tornadoes.Nepal lost both League 2 matches against hosts US (by three wickets and 37 runs).The outcome means Nepal ended their chaotic year managing just two wins in 12 League 2 matches as they sit in the seventh position in the eight-team standings. Their match against Oman during the Canada Tri-Series was also abandoned due to rain.Nepal play their next tri-series of the League 2 in Scotland in May next year. \nChitwan Rhinos, one of the eight franchise teams of the inaugural Nepal Premier League (NPL) T20 cricket tournament, have signed Namibia batter Jan Nicol Loftie-Eaton.The 23-year-old Namibian hitman will join South African Marchant de Lange, English Luc Benkenstein and Afghanistan’s Hassan Eisakhil in the Chitwan squad.The NPL is scheduled to take place from November 30 to December 21.Left-handed batter Loftie-Eaton broke the record for the fastest T20I hundred in the men’s cricket last year (now joint second fastest), a feat he achieved during Namibia's 20-run victory against Nepal in the Nepal T20I Tri-Nation Series in Kathmandu. Loftie-Eaton brought up his century in just 33 balls, eclipsing Kushal Malla’s record by one ball (currently fourth fastest in the list).Malla is the marquee signing of Chitwan.“I have fond memories of TU Cricket Ground,” Loftie-Eaton said after joining Chitwan. “It gave me one of the most iconic innings in T20I cricket. It’s time to do more of the same for Chitwan Rhinos at the Nepal Premier League in front of passionate Nepali cricket fans.”Chitwan’s Managing Director Aayush Neupane said: “It is there to see what Loftie-Eaton can do in T20 cricket. Nepali cricket fans saw him break Kushal’s record last season at the TU Ground. Now, both the swashbucklers will play for the same team. Fasten your seat belts.”Chitwan bought Rijan Dhakal, Kamal Airee, Sharad Vesawakar, Bipin Rawal, Santosh Karki, Dipesh Shrestha, Amar Singh Rautela, Deepak Bohara, Ranjeet Kumar and Gautam KC through auction last month. \nEnglish cricketer Stephan Eskinazi, known for his aggressive batting, joined Kathmandu Gurkhas for the Nepal Premier League T20 tournament starting on November 30.\nIn the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup League 2, Nepal lost to the US by 37 runs despite Anil Sah's 52 and Sompal Kami's late 46, falling short of the US's 281-8 total set by Monank Patel's 67, Saiteja Mukkamalla's 75, and Harmeet Singh's 59.\nNetanyahu and Israeli supporters celebrated Trump's election, while Hamas urged an end to \"blind support\" for Israel, with Trump's win potentially shifting Israel's international support and relations with the US.\nThe tradition of kite flying in Kathmandu, dating back to ancient China and introduced through traders, was both religiously and socially significant, involving kite fights, love letters, and competitions. Despite difficulties in securing materials and preparing thread, kite makers and sellers flourished during Dashain and used different types of kites made from Nepali paper or imported from Lucknow. Kite enthusiasts filled rooftops and open grounds, cheering for their favorites and celebrating the cutting of other kites' lines with the sound of \"chait.\" The season culminated in a grand event at Budhanilakantha, but the lack of open spaces, urbanization, and modern entertainment have led to a decline in the kite culture in recent decades.\nFrom 2008 to 2017, Matina Shakya served as Kumari, a goddess worshipped in Nepal, while Trishna Shakya took over in 2017; the tradition has evolved to prioritize the education and well-being of Kumaris and ex-Kumaris.\nJuddha Shumsher Rana's zoo in Jawalakhel, established in 1932, housed a diverse collection of animals, including elephants, horses, deer, monkeys, tigers, rhinos, leopards, red pandas, bears, civets, antelope, gorals, pheasants, monals, and even exotic species like crocodiles and porcupines, potentially including a lion.\nOn the fourth day of the five-day Tihar festivities, an enterprising person had fastened an ox to a temple pillar for the convenience of worshippers. Perhaps the bovine was transported from somewhere outside of Kathmandu Valley in a truck and then tethered by the side of a Shakta shrine close to a busy street. The ox appeared dazed, and its eyes looked glazed as it tried to yank some marigolds off garlands that the worshippers had put around its neck.Despite the relative flatness of rice paddies along riverbanks in the Nepal valley, the Newa community have historically resisted the temptation of using bullocks for pulling ploughs or drawing carts. Since the Nandi bull is revered as the sacred mount of Lord Shiva, all bullocks are deities requisitioned on Goru Tihar even in the hills and mountains where its utility as a drought animal is considered either impractical or sacrilegious. The importance of the bull for the cowherds of the Gopal kings that ruled over settlements in and around the Nepal valley nearly 3,500 years ago is indisputable. However, it wasn’t as inseparable with the everyday life of the pastoralists as with the farmers in the Indo-Gangetic Great Plains. Rather than castrate and domesticate male calves, cowherds allowed their bulls to roam free in the wilderness.One hardly needs to dedicate a day to worship the oxen as every day is the bull’s day in the Kathmandu valley. Ritualised practices, however, acquire religious, spiritual, or cultural connotations after multiple repetitions over time and become an integral part of the collective behaviour.Since events, personalities, practices and experiences aren’t always recorded, it needs constant retelling and multiple recounting for the remembrance of the past to solidify into myths of collective memory. Every narration, however, is a recreation—sometimes even a complete fabrication—of an imagined rather than an authentic past. Most, if not all, festivals are about collective memories: Various stories about a successful hunt of a dangerous predator in the land or water, the victory of a tribal chieftain over a more powerful aggressor, the sacrifice of a holy soul for the good of all, the challenges of sowing or the joys of harvesting and sometimes just the celebration of a pleasant season. Layers of legends and myths get added to various memorialised days as they become common festivals of the yearly calendar in different parts of the world. Since Hinduism is a collection of faiths with multiple deities and many sacred texts, unlike religions of “one God, his chosen Messenger and the holy Book”, it has more festive occasions of fasting, feasting and merrymaking than almost any other culture. But the dual processes of Brahmanisation of indigenous practices and marketisation of traditions have turned almost every festival into an event of ostentatious celebration, conspicuous consumption and thus invariably an expensive affair.Cultural SanskritisationWhen sociologist M.N. Srinivas (1916-1999) found that the “process by which a low caste or a tribe or a group changes its customs, ritual, ideology and way of life in the direction of a high twice-born caste” was more than Brahmanisation and included the adoption of lifestyles of dominant castes by the aspiring section of the erstwhile dominated groups, he began to use Sanskritisation for the method of upward mobility. Analogous to modernisation in many post-colonial cultures, Sanskritisation was the preferred way of establishing acceptability in the Chaturvarna society. The process of Sanskritisation transforms existing practices, absorbs folklores, co-opts tribal heroes, pulls myths into Sanskrit texts, renames rituals and adopts local deities as different avatars of the Hindu Trinity or the eternal Shakti. Last, but not the least, it often institutes a role for the Brahmin priests. Eventually, the socio-economic origins of a festive occasion are forgotten as it becomes a cultural practice with its prescribed rituals. Through multiple repetitions, memories get modified, and then a sanctified way of celebration is eventually established.It's possible to argue that Dashain in the mountains and valleys of the Mahabharata Ranges signified the end of monsoon: A short interlude of autumn for hunter-gatherers, a brief break for the farmers before the harvesting began, an occasion for tradesmen to embark on a journey to or from home, a sunny but balmy weather for everyone and hence a time to show one’s gratitude to Mother Nature through a family affair.The Shakta sect first appropriated Dashain through the legend of Mahishasura Mardini—a form of Durga, the fierce protector of durg, the Sanskrit term for fortress. The Vaishnavas of the Ganga plains added the lore of Lord Ram burning demon-king Ravana with fiery arrows. Adherents of the Shaiva sect are indifferent to the religious significance and continue to mark Dashain as a cultural event of family reunion with food, drink, songs, dance and games.Mindless marketisationThe Brahmanisation process of Sanskritisation seems to have mutated into Vaisyakaran or commercialisation of festivals with manipulators of the market pushing conspicuous consumption and pretentious religiosity. It made sense to get new clothes before Dashain to prepare the family for the coming winter, but luring gullible masses into borrowing to buy consumer durables that they can ill-afford is a symptom of mindless marketisation.Somewhat like Dashain for the hunter-gatherers, the Yam Panchak probably began as a tribute to the forces of nature after the farming revolution that made a settled life possible: Crows as a sign of human habitation, dogs as guards of cattle, cows as givers of milk, oxen as pullers of plough and finally the bonding between brothers and sisters to keep the extended family intact. The day of the crow (Kaag Tihar) was first appropriated as the Dhanbantari Jayanti to honour the healer-sage of yore. Then it became the day to mark the acquisition of household goods and now more gold is sold and bought on the “day of good health”, which has now become Dhanteras, than any other occasion. Adherents ritually worship crows, dogs, cows and oxen but alarm pet parents and frighten birds and animals by bursting firecrackers.Incidentally, legends of Nepal Sambat of Newa community (the largesse of Shankhadhar Sakhwa) and Bestu Varas (Lord Krishna protecting pastoralists from the fury of Indra) of Gujratis are different, but both mark the beginning of a new accounting year for the traders. The season of festivities will end with the five-day-long Chhath Mahaparva of the Greater Mithila that includes large swathes of land where Bajjika, Bhojpuri, Hindi, Magahi and Nepali are the chosen languages of communication now. It has spread with the diaspora of the region all over the world.Just as Dashain and Deepawali were folk festivals before Sanskritisation, Chhath was a penance of commoners to appease Mother Nature present in the five elements of life: Earth, fire, water, air and sky. The word Chhath is said to be derived from Shashthi Tithi, but Chhaith in Maithili simply meant ‘She is’: Omnipresent, timeless, formless, nameless and generous. Sneaking Sanskritisation is ritualising observance, creeping commercialisation is leading towards competitive display of wealth and misguided marketisation is adding land, air, water, fire and sound pollution. May Chhathi Maiya forgive her devotees who have forgotten the inviolability of Mother Nature and bless us all with health, happiness and mindfulness.   \nRoad crashes claim nearly 11.9 lakh lives globally every year, with two to five crore people suffering non-fatal injuries (as of 2023 data). Among these, vulnerable road users (VRUs)—including pedestrians, motorcyclists, and cyclists—account for over half of all traffic-related deaths. Pedestrians, in particular, face significant risks as they lack protection when sharing the road with vehicles. Crossing the road is especially hazardous, with many incidents occurring in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where inadequate infrastructure exacerbates the danger.Bangladesh is not immune to these challenges. Roadside environments near schools, factories, and commercial centres generate high volumes of pedestrian crossings, especially along major highways. Without proper infrastructure, crossing the road can be life-threatening; the road traffic fatality rate in the country is alarmingly high, at 102.1 fatalities per 10,000 vehicles—over 10 times the Southeast Asian average. In 2018, massive student protests erupted in Bangladesh after two high school students were killed in a road crash, highlighting the urgency of improving pedestrian safety. Traditionally, highway agencies have implemented at-grade crossings like zebra crossings or built footbridges and underpasses, but pedestrian usage of these facilities remains low.In developing countries like Bangladesh, the debate over pedestrian safety often revolves around two main points: poor infrastructure design and road user behaviour. While road authorities and professionals often attribute pedestrian injuries and fatalities to the reckless actions of pedestrians and drivers, the users themselves frequently point to inadequate and unsafe facilities. However, ensuring road safety, particularly for vulnerable users such as students and workers commuting across highways, requires shared responsibility and collaboration between authorities and the public.The Safe System approach emphasises that authorities are primarily responsible for providing safe infrastructure. However, road users' needs and behaviours must also be considered to create effective and lasting solutions. Unfortunately, these user-centred elements (i.e. understanding pedestrian behaviour and promoting positive change) are often overlooked in the design of road interventions in Bangladesh.A recent study examined the institutional design practices in Bangladesh and explored the benefits of using a participatory design process, known as co-design, alongside a behaviour change framework to enhance pedestrian safety. The study's goal was to identify how these methods could improve the effectiveness of road safety interventions, reduce injuries and fatalities, and promote shared responsibility among stakeholders.In Bangladesh, professionals from local road agencies first proposed conventional design interventions at four highway sites known for high pedestrian traffic. Focus group discussions were then held with students and workers—those most at risk while crossing these highways. Following these discussions, four co-design workshops were conducted, allowing road users to collaborate with professionals in creating safety interventions. To further enhance the design process, a behaviour change model, COM-B (Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation influencing Behaviour), was integrated into some of the workshops. The study's methodology involved comparing interventions created solely by professionals with those developed through co-design, as well as evaluating the added benefits of incorporating the COM-B model. The efficacy of each intervention was assessed through safety evaluations and stakeholder feedback.The results were striking. Co-designed interventions—created in collaboration with road users—demonstrated significant improvements in usability and safety compared to conventional designs. The participants contributed valuable insights into the practical challenges they face, enabling the creation of more intuitive and effective infrastructure. Incorporating the COM-B model yielded even more positive outcomes, addressing not only design flaws but also encouraging safer crossing behaviour among pedestrians.Perhaps one of the most critical findings was the shift in perception among stakeholders. Interviews revealed that co-design fostered a sense of shared responsibility, breaking the blame cycle where authorities and road users point fingers at each other. By involving users in the design process, stakeholders gained a better understanding of the challenges faced by pedestrians and began working collaboratively to find solutions.Bangladesh is not alone in its struggle to protect vulnerable road users. Worldwide, VRUs, especially in LMICs, are disproportionately affected by road crashes. Pedestrians in these regions often rely on outdated or poorly designed infrastructure, while intervention strategies from high-income countries (HICs) primarily focus on vehicle passengers and may not be applicable in LMIC contexts. Designing effective solutions requires an understanding of local injury patterns and the unique challenges faced by pedestrians.The Safe System approach, widely advocated in HICs, emphasises authorities' responsibility to ensure road safety through proper design and infrastructure. However, in many LMICs, the gap between user behaviour and infrastructure use remains unaddressed. As the study in Bangladesh highlights, interventions that fail to consider user behaviour are unlikely to succeed, no matter how well-designed they may appear on paper. By combining co-design with behaviour change models like COM-B, authorities can create interventions that not only meet safety standards but also encourage proper usage.The findings of this study underscore the potential of co-design and behaviour change models to transform road safety for vulnerable users. By involving pedestrians in the design process, authorities can ensure that crossing facilities are both safe and intuitive to use. Furthermore, the integration of the COM-B model helps address behavioural factors that influence road safety, leading to more effective and sustainable interventions.In Bangladesh and other developing nations, where resources for road safety are often limited, these innovative approaches offer a cost-effective solution. Co-design promotes shared responsibility, while behaviour change models help bridge the gap between user behaviour and safe infrastructure use. As Bangladesh moves forward, adopting these strategies could significantly reduce pedestrian injuries and fatalities, creating a safer road environment for all.—The Daily Star (Bangladesh)/ANN \nThe global order is crumbling rapidly. It appears nowhere near the Schumpeterian idea of creative destruction; Jacques Derrida's deconstruction theory, therefore, barely posits the optimism of legendary phoenix-like revival. The global playground of powers is now without a custodian or a referee to stop the ratchet. It is almost axiomatic that the global order is critical to global governance, which is inevitable for global peace and prosperity. In this increasingly interconnected world, societal and national orders are also largely contingent on the global order and the outcome of the geopolitics of the governance, whether good or bad.The imperative of global governance was desperately realised in the 1940s after the two devastating Great Wars. As a result, essentially, the United Nations (UN), World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF), General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT, now WTO) and similar other multilateral institutions were established. So far, hundreds of international treaties, conventions and covenants have been drafted and implemented or enforced, at least in theory. However, due to the rapidly widening gap between expectation and (in)effectiveness (or helplessness?), these institutions and instruments, mainly the UN and its agencies, are now being questioned regarding the rationale of their very existence.Without a refereeThe end of the Russia-Ukraine war is nowhere on the horizon. Russian President Vladimir Putin appears to be consolidating his legitimacy through forums like Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS). Economic sanctions on Russia by Western countries have had little impact due to the unhindered revenue flow from oil and gas supplied to Europe and Asia. The Gaza crisis is spreading to the entire Arab world and, perhaps, beyond. The foreign policy of the United States on Gaza and Israel seems pressed between its interest in protecting the Israeli state and saving its democratic credentials by stopping inhuman excesses at the Israeli war targets. Digital, communication and transportation technologies, such as artificial intelligence, the Internet and drones, are being used more for destructive purposes, such as starting wars, rather than serve humanity. Trade wars have intensified. The global debt balloon has spiralled out of control, and so has the climate crisis. So, apprehensions abound that we may be on the verge of World War III.Personalities like UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres often cry foul from the fringes, but there are no takers of it. The UN is unable to safeguard its agency, UNWRA (The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East), against the formal Israeli allegations of colluding with the groups that Israel has labelled as 'terrorists'. They are even incapable of admonishing the countries that are blatantly engaged in arms sales and doing nothing tangible to mitigate the potential threat of nuclear war. The leaders of powerful nations on the frontline continue to disregard international laws, rules or norms, sine qua non for maintaining global order and, thereby, ensuring fair global governance.Of course, there is a broader age-old unanswered question surrounding the very design of these institutions, choice of location for their headquarters, personnel selection processes, modus operandi and funding mechanisms. All these aspects were ab initio at the control and mercy of the same group of powerful nations that often choose to flout the so-called international rules and norms. The current international governance mayhem is akin to a game without a referee capable of flagging a foul to powerful global players who are quarrelling rather than respecting the game of rules.Throb of repolarisationThe debate over the shift of the global power poles and the emergence of multipolarity is gaining currency. However, the throb and thong of creating, recognising and sustaining multiple such poles have fiercely gripped the world. The emerging potential poles are keen to build new alliances, while the existing ones exert all efforts not to lose their grip. This has resulted in multifaceted tit-for-tat actions and reactions among the countries through diplomatic rows, strategic bans and fresh trade barriers.Within days after Putin appeared in a triumphant mood regarding his ability to invite leaders from 36 countries for the 16th BRICS Summit in Russia on 22-24 October, the US government on October 30 imposed ‘sanctions on nearly four hundred entities and individuals for enabling Russia’s illegal war against Ukraine.’ This action targets multiple sectors essential to Russia’s war effort.’ This includes the ‘entities and individuals’ from China, India, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Türkiye, Switzerland, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) who continue to sell ‘important dual-use goods to Russia, including critical components that the country relies on for its weapons systems to wage war against Ukraine.’Extracting allegianceThis United States’ move is critical since it involves putative allies and big trade partners like India, Switzerland and the UAE. India is part of ‘the Quad’, the group of four countries (the other three being Australia, Japan and Australia) created out of large ‘democracies’ in the Indo-Pacific region. They had a summit in the last week of September in Washington, DC. The US sanction to 19 Indian entities and two Indian nationals comes at a time when its diplomatic row with Canada, one of the closest US allies, is at its height. Its trade deficit with Russia was $57.14 billion last year against the export of only $4.26 billion. India is among the countries which continued to import Russian oil during the Western sanctions. Nepal is one of the beneficiaries of stable oil prices that are maintained due to this supply. The American move appears to extract unconditional allegiance from India, moving away from Russian engagement. The tug-of-war of creating or breaking alliances is poised to only be nastier in the future.The most alarming and dangerous trait is that the war, financing billions from these rich countries, has been forthcoming and instant. However, humanitarian and development assistance to the developing world has been asymptotic to zero for decades. What’s more, the governments and parliaments of these countries are approving these finances to the parties of their interest at the cost of astronomical debt burden to their treasuries. The IMF estimates that the global public debt will exceed $100 trillion, or about 93 percent of the global gross domestic product, by the end of this year. Only two countries, the US and China, account for 50 percent of it—$36 trillion and 16 trillion, respectively. There is no mechanism to tame them. \nLow-quality goods and price manipulation are rampant in Nepali markets. Are the milk and butter we are buying fresh? What about rice, lentils, noodles and other goods in groceries? And are we being sold fake sneakers and jeans slapped with the labels of popular brands? Also, who among us has not been frustrated when we order one thing online and something completely different arrives? It’s frustrating. But there is hope on the horizon. Starting December, the government plans to establish a consumer court in Kathmandu to hear the consumers’ grievances and complaints against unethical market practices. The court is finally coming into being, nearly three years after a Supreme Court directive. Consumer protection in Nepal has for long been overlooked. The Consumer Protection Act 2018 did mandate the establishment of consumer courts, but there were significant delays in its implementation. This in turn emboldened unscrupulous traders and led to the proliferation of their businesses. Meanwhile, Nepali consumers, long used to getting shoddy deals, have long since stopped complaining. But the new court will allow them to resolve even minor issues quickly and effectively within a specialised setting guided by judges who are experts in consumer law. Consumers only need a bill of goods and services to file a case and they will not have to wait long for a hearing.But there is also bad news. This service is only limited to the federal capital, Kathmandu, which will initially hear cases from Lalitpur, Kathmandu and Bhaktapur. Plans are underway for an extension to other districts and provinces, but officials fear lack of adequate budget and bureaucratic hurdles may hinder such an expansion. Some local units have acted against malpractices and punished businesspersons who cheat on customers, but these initiatives are insufficient. What we really need is a nationwide network of consumer courts. Last fiscal year alone, the Department of Food Technology and Quality Control filed 178 cases in the District Administration Office, Kathmandu. These cases were related to processed drinking water, food items, lentils, sweet items, oil and ghee, milk and dairy items, and spices. The department recorded many cases of substandard products produced by major brands like Bhat-Bhateni food products, Dabur Nepal, CG Oil and Derivatives and Pokhara Noodles. These businesses were found to be flouting Nepal’s consumer laws and compromising people’s health. Consumer protection provisions were thus due. Now that the country is embarking on the journey of establishing consumer courts, there should be no further delays. Expansion of the courts beyond the confines of Kathmandu Valley should not be a big problem too. We hear of large chunks of budgets of all three levels of government in Nepal going unspent every single year. What better way to spend the money than in ensuring that people get value for their money—at a time unjustified price hikes and selling of fakes is giving them a lot of headache? This is why United Nations Guidelines for Consumer Protection recognise the “access to and availability dispute resolution and redress mechanism as a basic need of consumers”. That is also among people’s basic rights as taxpayers.  \nFrequent plane crashes, natural disasters, poor infrastructure and bureaucratic challenges—they all ail Nepali tourism. There is a dire need to ramp up efforts to get it on track. But then we as a country are taking a step back when the rest of the world is looking to boost tourism with robust plans and policies. The Civil Aviation Authority’s latest decision to close Tribhuvan International Airport—Nepal’s only ariel gateway for foreign tourists and the sole door of opportunities for millions of its citizens—for 10 hours (10 pm to 8 am) to complete a long-overdue taxiway expansion, has garnered national and international criticism for the strain it will put on the country’s tourism.While there is nothing wrong with the project to renovate taxiways that have worn out from years of use, the authorities perhaps didn’t consider its impact on tourism and passengers seriously. The airport closure from November 8 to March 31 is bound to inconvenience foreign visitors as it coincides with both autumn and spring peak trekking seasons. Festivals, family reunions, holidays and favourable weather make this season the perfect time to travel to Nepal. Such a prolonged halt will only dampen people’s enthusiasm. One is left wondering why such a vital time was chosen for these renovations.The financial repercussions are substantial. The Nepal Tourism Board, which had aimed for 1.3 million tourists this year, has cut down the expected number to 1.1 million. This could lead to a revenue loss of around Rs50 billion for the airline and tourism industry. Indirect cost could be many times higher. International airlines have cut flights or cancelled tickets at short notice, taking airfares to all-time highs. For instance, the most popular destination in November, Sydney, which would have cost Rs85,000 on normal days, will now cost Rs217,000 (for the highest priced tickets) and Rs114,000 (lowest). For average Nepali workers and students, these fares are unaffordable. Tourism entrepreneurs are facing losses as hotels are reporting cancellations.In 2019, for the same project, the airport was closed for seven hours (11:30 pm to 6:30 am) after which 24/7 operations began for the first time to compensate for the lost flight hours. Earlier this year, too, for the very project, landings from the northern side of the airport were barred, but there were no airport closures. Given these precedents, one would have expected more robust planning this time. Instead, it seems there has not been enough homework. The civil aviation authorities’ efforts to manage the Kathmandu airport’s congestion by redirecting traffic to Pokhara and Gautam Buddha international airports have also failed because no foreign airline operator is willing to fly to these destinations. Travel trade entrepreneurs lament that this “unplanned construction” is taking too long and fear it might extend to spring, another peak tourist season. This is understandable given Nepal’s poor record in completing roads and infrastructure. They have also urged the authorities to limit the shutdown to five hours. However, that risks further delaying the project. A balanced approach that prioritises tourism and passengers while ensuring timely completion is the best. The International Air Transport Association’s (IATA) request that the authorities shorten the closure or spare high-traffic days is logical. Halting operations at peak arrival and departure is neither wise nor sustainable. Ultimately, the health of the country’s civil aviation is closely linked to the state of its regulator. Right now, it appears that our top aviation officials are working more for themselves than for the benefit of the intended beneficiaries.  \nNepal has again shown how ill-prepared and neglectful it is about running a project built and handed over by a foreign friend. This has been Nepal’s chronic problem mainly after the 1990 political change: Nepali authorities have turned several entities built by or with the support of foreign donors into non-functioning bodies. The latest victim of neglect is the Jayanagar-Kurtha cross-border railway. India’s Konkan Railways Corporation Limited (KRCL) has been helping Nepal operate the railway by providing its staffers to run trains along the route. The Indian Railway Construction International Limited had built the section and handed it over to the Nepal Railway Company Limited in June last year. Erstwhile prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi jointly flagged off the railway, which is considered a milestone in cross-border connectivity between the two countries.As Nepal’s only railway company had no trained staff to run the trains, the Indian company, KRCL, agreed to provide the human resources until the Nepali side had necessary staff, including technicians. The Indian company was also ready to train Nepalis. For that, all the Nepali side needed to do was select people and send them for training across the border. But Nepali authorities failed to do even that bare minimum. Eventually, the Indian company wrote to the Nepali side asking either to renew the contract that expires in December or terminate it. As Nepali authorities are still unprepared to run the train, they are planning to extend the contract with the KRCL for another year. The Indian company provides 28 railway technicians, including engine drivers, whom the local railway administration has been paying hefty amounts in salaries and perks. This is not the first project built with the support of a friendly country that Nepal has failed to run properly. In the 1970s, China built a 13-kilometre trolley bus route where buses operated through overhead electric cables from Kathmandu to Bhaktapur. Within years of China handing over the mass transit project, it started facing one after another managerial problems. Eventually, the project collapsed and the Nepal government closed it in 2009. The case of the Jayanagar-Kurtha cross-border railway will inspire no trust among either India or China, the two neighbours, both of whom supposedly want to boost rail connectivity with Nepal. The Indian side has been working to develop a cross-border Raxaul-Kathmandu railway line. The Indian company KRCL last year submitted its location survey report for the proposed line. Similarly, a China-Nepal cross-border railway project connecting Chinese city Kerung and Nepal’s capital Kathmandu has long been a stuff of Nepali dreams.For a relatively poor country like Nepal, there is no alternative to taking support from other countries to develop big projects. But such ventures should be taken as opportunities for both technology and skill transfer. Yet that is apparently not how the authorities in Kathmandu see things. If the country can’t build certain projects on its own, it should at least have a clear vision and a plan on how to run the ones it accepts from generous donors. If the country continues to be neglectful of the support of its foreign friends, not only will it reflect poorly on Nepal’s standing as a trusted partner. It will also show that the country is uninterested in learning from its friends abroad and in time developing its own capabilities to run vital projects and ventures. If Nepal cannot help itself, it is useless to seek outside help.  \nFormer Election Commissioner Bhojraj Pokharel, despite successfully conducting Nepal's first constituent assembly elections, witnessed the erosion of electoral integrity due to the increasing influence of big business on political parties, leading to a surge in corruption and the weakening of state agencies.\nDuring his term as home minister in the previous Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government that was toppled in mid-July, Narayan Kaji Shrestha, who is also senior vice-chair of the CPN (Maoist Centre), undertook some bold actions. He swung into action on high profile corruption cases such as Bhutanese refugee scam, Lalita Niwas land grab and cross-border gold smuggling. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal met him on Sunday to ask him of the performance of the new government, the saga around the arrest of Rastriya Swatantra Party chair Rabi Lamichhane.CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, as leader of the main opposition party, convened a joint meeting of opposition parties on Friday. It seems the opposition parties want to solidify their unity against the ruling coalition. What will be the opposition camp’s strategy to build pressure on the government?The government has not been effective in relief distribution, rehabilitation and reconstruction in the areas ravaged by the devastating floods and landslides in the last week of September. Therefore, we convened the meeting to draw the government’s attention to this sorry state of affairs. Second, right since the formation of this government [in mid-July], we suspected this coalition would play a negative role in terms of controlling corruption as the present coalition partners joined hands after being scared of the anti-corruption movement launched by our government [led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal]. It has become imperative to stop the government from doing wrong things and alert the people. Third, there are suspicions that the government is preparing to make it easier for dissident groups in various parties to split political parties by amending the Political Parties Act-2017 through an ordinance. Thus, we basically wanted to press the government to effectively carry out the post-disaster rehabilitation works and stop it from various wrongdoings.Are there specific issues on which the opposition camp wants to build pressure?Effective work on rehabilitation and reconstruction in the disaster-hit areas is our immediate demand. In the long-run, we want to raise the agenda of good governance because developing Nepal as a prosperous country and ensuring social justice should be our central mission. But this isn’t possible without first curbing rampant corruption. Unfortunately, the government is taking a negative approach in this connection.Could you give more specific details where the government went wrong in terms of corruption?To take the latest example, the CPN-UML, which is headed by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, recently accepted a donation of land worth tens of millions of rupees from Min Bahadur Gurung, owner of the country’s largest retail chain, Bhatbhateni Supermarket. The business tycoon has also announced plans to make a building for the party. During our tenure, the government filed a corruption case against him in Lalita Niwas land scam. He was arrested and later the Special Court convicted him of corruption. The land has already been retained as government property. Later, he moved the Supreme Court, where the case is sub judice. Prime Minister Oli had earlier vented his ire for arresting and filing a case against Gurung. We had suspected that he had done something wrong in collusion with Gurung. Oli’s acceptance of the property in the name of donation is unacceptable on political and moral grounds. It is against the good governance drive we launched. You know, we had initiated action in various major corruption scams during our tenure. There are reports that the government is trying to give clean chit to the accused instead of taking the process ahead. Thus the present coalition is working against good governance.In the meeting of the opposition coalition on Friday, Rastriya Swatantra Party chair Rabi Lamichhane, who was arrested on Saturday, sought support of other opposition parties [based on the information that he was being arrested] arguing that action against him was politically motivated. Will the opposition parties support him?Any case should be independently and fairly investigated. No culprit should be spared. At the same time, no political bias should reflect in the investigation. We can’t say anything about the government agencies’ investigation process. The meeting stressed on the same. It was during my tenure as home minister that the government initiated the investigation against Lamichhane after a supplementary case was registered at the Kaski District Police Office, accusing him of misusing deposits from a Kaski-based cooperative. Later, the parliament formed a special probe committee to investigate. Now the home ministry has taken action against him based on the recommendation of the same panel. We have to cooperate with the government in its investigation. The only thing we can say is that the investigation should be fair and independent. No political party can stand against the investigation itself. How do you see the protests by the RSP cadres following his arrest?They can raise their voice against the possibility of political revenge in the case and demand fair investigation. But they have to cooperate in the investigation and accept the findings. No one can obstruct the investigation just because someone is a politician. The government agencies can’t enforce rule of law if all political parties start protesting against investigations on individuals affiliated to them. A few of the RSP’s concerns are valid too. They argue that the government is working in a discriminatory way. For instance, there are reports with evidence showing involvement of some Nepali Congress and CPN-UML leaders in various cooperatives’ scams. They have asked why the government is not taking any action against them. This is a valid question. The authorities should take action against Congress and UML leaders as well to prove that the government is not discriminatory.Various high-profile corruption cases were prosecuted during your tenure as home minister. You understand if a case has been built on strong or weak grounds. From that perspective, what is your observation of Lamichhane’s case?Rabi ji himself has accepted a level of involvement in the case and said that he is ready to bear the financial liability of the cooperative money invested in the Gorkha Media Network [where he was managing director]. I can comment about the overall case only after the investigation is completed.The fact that over half-a-dozen home ministers since 1990 have been prosecuted in corruption cases shows powerful politicians are involved in corruption. Can this deep-rooted corruption be cleaned up?It is one of the major reasons hindering Nepal’s development. Corruption is promoted by those who are in key state positions. Therefore, we often say our state agencies are influenced by comprador capitalists and there is no investment in productive sectors that would create jobs. Our entire economic ecosystem of creating demand, production, supply and employment has failed. The nexus between powerful politicians, bureaucrats and a handful of business tycoons is promoting activities from where they get huge commissions, and where they get to exploit state coffers. Nepal can’t progress without breaking this nexus. We had taken strong actions in that direction. Unfortunately, the present coalition stopped that process and the comprador capitalists have yet again become active.You must have faced pressure from the political and other quarters when you took action against powerful leaders. Could you give some examples of such pressure?You know, though our party led the government, the other party [Nepali Congress] was the bigger force in the coalition government and actions were taken against the major leaders of the coalition partners. Even those who were affiliated to our party faced actions. So, definitely I faced immense political pressure. But no one could stop me as I was determined to complete my mission of good governance. But a section of people accuse you of sparing individuals close to top leaders and that some individuals were later freed on bail as the cases against them weren’t built as strongly.That is not the case. I pushed the cases despite huge political pressures. But the court later freed them on bail, where we have no role. The court has put some individuals behind bars while some were released. The role of the court is certainly a matter of research. You are right that people wonder why more powerful people aren’t brought under investigation even in big scams such as Bhutanese refugee scam and Lalita Niwas land grab. Media reports indicating powerful individuals’ involvement might be true. However, the government agencies can’t take action against anyone without sufficient evidence. Many have asked why two former prime ministers—Madhav Kumar Nepal and Baburam Bhattarai—were not prosecuted. The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) didn’t recommend action against them saying that the policy decisions made in Cabinet meetings don’t fall under its jurisdiction. And, it is still unclear which decisions made in the Cabinet are policy decisions and which aren’t.The secretaries who prepare proposals for Cabinet decisions are held responsible while the ministers who present the same proposals for a decision at the Cabinet meeting and the chief of the Cabinet are not held responsible. People have raised questions about this practice. I think this is a valid question and should be addressed properly. I also believe the ministers who present a proposal for a decision should be held responsible.Also questions were raised over the way the statements of the two prime ministers [Nepal and Bhattarai] were recorded at their homes and in the absence of a government attorney.I take this criticism positively. When I enquired about this episode, police told me that they did so because the CIAA had earlier recorded other former prime ministers at their homes and the police followed the same precedent. In the future, we should be careful. There is one crucial aspect in this case. The two prime ministers weren’t prosecuted in the Lalita Niwas land grab case. But the court has proved that the land deal was wrong. So, it has been recovered as government property. Thus, the decisions taken from the Cabinet meetings [chaired by Nepal and Bhattarai] were wrong. Don’t they need to do public self-criticism?Let’s move on to party politics. As in the past, leaders in your party rigorously discussed the issue of leadership change in Maoist Centre in recent meetings. But nothing happened. Do you see any chance of leadership change in the Maoist Centre?In our recent party meetings, we discussed whether the party’s transformation is more important or leadership change. We need a more unified, transformed and stronger party to implement our party’s agenda in national politics. This is more important. We discussed whether our leadership at present is obstructing this process. Our leadership is ready to work to transform the party, make the organisation stronger and then hand over the leadership. Our chair wants to take the party back to its past strength. We have taken his spirit positively. But this doesn’t mean that Prachanda [Dahal] is irreplaceable.Amid reports about reunification between various Maoist parties, party chairman Dahal and Nepal Communist Party General Secretary Netra Bikram Chand have both spoken on the need for such reunification. Is it happening soon?Our conclusion is that our party can take leadership in carrying out important national tasks. In principle we are in the right direction but the party can’t accomplish the tasks in its present form. So it needs to be made stronger. The ideological and moral grounds of our party have eroded. We have been distanced from downtrodden communities while party leaders have increased proximity with the well-off class. On the other hand, corruption has increased within the party. Therefore, we want to transform the party into a more revolutionary and stronger force. This should be the priority. But even after that, our party’s present strength alone will not suffice to accomplish important national tasks. So we have decided to join hands with more left and Maoist forces. Discussions with various groups for party unity and forging alliances are underway.Reports say the negotiation with the Chand-led party is more positive.The [Chand-led] party made two important decisions from a central committee meeting. They decided to go for party unity and take part in the next general elections. This is an important policy departure of the party. It has increased the possibility of party unity. But we haven’t reached any definite conclusion in this connection. Do you see any chances of forging a working alliance with new forces such as the RSP?The new forces raised an agenda [of good governance] and got good support from the public in elections. But people have already started complaining against them saying that they didn’t work as per their promises. They have started comparing them to traditional forces. The new leaders from whom people had expected a lot have already courted controversy. Having said that, we can’t brush aside the public disenchantment towards major political forces as well.The RSP champions an agenda which is quite different from what the Maoist Centre lobbies for. For instance, the policies the Maoist Centre and the RSP advocate on the federal system are opposite. In this context, can the two parties be long-term allies?The RSP has failed to be honest to the agenda it championed in the elections and to make its political ideology clear. And it has adopted a wrong policy on the federal system. Therefore, at present, we can’t say that we will have a long-term strategic collaboration. There is no reliable basis for that. As far as a working alliance is concerned, it can be with any party. For instance, we have diametrically opposed political viewpoints with the Rastriya Prajatantra Party. They want monarchy while we are strongly for the republic system. They are against federalism while we want a stronger federal system. But we can still forge a working alliance with them on certain agendas.Opposition parties seem quite scared of ordinance on Political Parties Act-2017. There is a need to end the legal void that exists after Congress-Maoist Centre government issued an ordinance three years ago. Is it based on the information about certain provisions that the government is implementing or because it is being brought by bypassing the parliament?It is true that there has been delay in reviving the provisions of the law that were inactivated after introduction of the ordinance at the time. We want that to be done through parliament. Now the government wants to make changes in it because it wants to meet certain vested political interests through it. There are suspicions that the present government leadership is working to split small parties and make the UML the largest in the House of Representatives.Why would Congress help the prime minister bring an ordinance that would make it smaller than the UML?That is why they might be at loggerheads over the issue. What I heard is that both the proposals to arrest Rabi Lamichhane and to issue the ordinance on the Political Parties Act-2017 were discussed in the same Cabinet meeting. The Congress reportedly pushed for the proposal on Lamichhane while the prime minister was for issuing the ordinance as well. It is certain that there is a tug of war between the two sides over the ordinance. \nCentral and eastern parts of Nepal witnessed devastating incidents of landslides and floods last week. At least 244 people were killed, while 19 are still missing. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Basanta Raj Adhikari, director at the Centre for Disaster Studies, Institute of Engineering at Tribhuvan University, to discuss how the country can be better prepared to manage the disasters and minimise damages.Recently we faced disastrous floods and landslides. How do you analyse the losses? Could the damages have been reduced with better preparation and timely response?To begin with, I want to make one thing clear. There is a fundamental difference between a disaster and hazard. Hazard is always natural but it becomes a disaster if there is human involvement. If there is a landslide in a jungle with no human activity, it is a hazard. If a landslide hit a human settlement and it required external involvement to restore the place, then it becomes a disaster. An earthquake is a hazard but it becomes a disaster when man-made structures kill people. As far as the losses from the recent floods are concerned, we could have minimised them with better preparation. For instance, Nakkhu was one of the worst hit areas in the Kathmandu Valley. The river there has drastically narrowed and a human settlement has been developed on the riverbanks in recent years. Human activities in rivers are natural as human civilisations took place on the banks of rivers. But it should be done without disrupting the natural flow of the water. We developed huge settlements encroaching the riverbanks. This invited huge losses. Such activities could have been avoided.As Nepal witnessed record-high rainfalls, were not these losses to be expected? It is true that the country witnessed record rainfalls this season, the highest in the past over five decades. Climate change has caused extreme weather events in recent years. But we can’t blame only natural factors. If you see the images of 2003, it clearly shows that the place where the MediCity Hospital now stands is clearly the floodplain of the Nakkhu river. If you go further downstream, you see a colony. This is how we have encroached riverbanks. We can encroach rivers but it should be done in a scientific way. What is scientific encroachment of rivers?We can model flooding based on the highest volume of water a river can carry. Based on such evidence, we can decide what kind of activities can and cannot be carried out on a riverbank. We can develop settlements but that should be based on scientific evidence and data. Another important concept we should follow is risk sensitive land use planning. Nepal government has already prepared land use maps of all the 753 local units that give vital information about a particular place such as the soil, land capability, risk layer, present land use map, zoning map and cadastral layer. But some people have stopped the authorities from implementing the maps as once they are passed, a land categorised as an agricultural area cannot be converted into commercial land. If that scheme is implemented, one can’t build a house in high flood land. Now the local authorities enforce only the building codes and that don’t include these provisions. That doesn’t inquire whether a building is being built on a riverbank or a landslide susceptible area. In developed countries, those who build in high flood risk areas have to pay more in insurance. Also, areas are categorised based on the chances of occurrence of landslides on the basis of soil type, rock type, geology, distance from a drainage or a road etcetera and structures built there are dealt with accordingly. We are witnessing extreme weather events. In this context, what should we do to prevent more loss in the days ahead?We require an engineering paradigm shift in building infrastructures. The extreme weather patterns have made the data we used to refer to in the past while building infrastructures irrelevant. The data on water levels that were referred to while making a bridge in a river now need to be updated as water levels in our rivers have been rising in recent years. The existing infrastructures can’t withstand that volume of water. We witnessed record rainfalls last week. This can be a reference data for some years. Also, the sedimentation pattern has changed because of human settlements built upstream.Second, we have a generalised rule of building roads across the country. The impact of 200 millilitres of rainfall in Pokhara and rainfall of the same volume in Jhapa is different. As Pokhara experiences rains on a regular basis, the soil in the area can withstand it because it has been weathered by regular rain but the same volume of rainfall can cause more losses in Jhapa because of weak soil there. We thus have to consider the strength of soil while building a structure in a particular place.There is a single road construction method across the country, whether the place is in a high himalayan range, Mahabharat, Shivalik hills or plains. We have to make specific rules for specific places based on the geological and soil structures. The parameters of road construction should be redefined. We are improving the weather forecasting system but now we also need impact-based forecasting to inform the public not only about the volume of likely rainfall but also its likely impact.Where are the problems in our disaster response approach?The Natural Calamity (Relief) Act, 1982 was guided by a fatalistic approach as it saw natural hazards as destined by fate. Then came Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act, 2017. This change in law is in fact a paradigm shift in disaster management in Nepal. The new law’s perspective is progressive. The new Act changed us from response-centric to preparedness-centric. Legally, we are on a progressive path. But we lag in implementation. We also need to upgrade our skills in handling the situation. Our constitution as well as laws have entrusted local units with the responsibility of handling disaster incidents on their own. The government should make people at the local level aware, and equip and train them for the purpose.Training on some important procedures such as the INSARAG preparedness and response guidelines can be quite effective. Such training and other activities aimed at helping local units to handle disaster incidents should be conducted at the ward levels. “Understanding risk” is an important aspect in disaster management. So common people should be sensitised to the consequences of disaster incidents. You can see people collecting timber from flooded rivers, taking selfies on riverbanks and gathering on a bridge above a roaring river. People at all local wards need to be well-equipped. Those who were swept away at Nakkhu could have been saved if the security personnel and other people there had at least motorboats and life jackets. Our rescue workers now lack even such basic things.Settlements in Nepal’s mountainous and hill areas are located in equally risky zones. What should be done to safeguard them?The mountains in our region are taken as young and the Himalayan range is in the building process. It is also called an active mountain belt. Therefore, we experience frequent earthquakes. Earthquakes cause geomorphological changes. A large number of settlements in Nepal’s hills sit on the debris of old landslides that might have occurred long back. People there should be made aware of the risk and these places be identified. Engineering measures should be taken to make them safe. Scattered populations mainly in the highlands need to be integrated in concentrated settlements.What is the latest status of glaciers and glacial lakes in our mountains?The pace of glacial melting is rising alarmingly because of rising temperature. Earlier, we took only big glacial lakes as threats and gave them more attention but recent incidents showed that even smaller ones pose a threat. The incident of the Thame glacial lake outburst in August showed how the outburst of even a small glacial lake could have a cascading effect. Likewise, the deposits of landslides being piled above 3,000 metres are another serious challenge. Such sediment deposition is increasing in the mountains while there is a huge population downstream. The frequency of cascading hazards has increased, emerging as a major challenge. A landslide blocks a river and when the river breaches the structure built of debris, it causes devastating losses downstream.How can we scientifically prove that the hazards we are seeing were the result of climate change?There has to be scientific evidence to make the link. For instance, the Thame glacial outburst was clearly a climate change-induced hazard as it did not involve human activities. The treeline and snowline are shifting upwards in our mountains. There were no mosquitoes in Mustang until some years ago. Now mosquitos are widespread in the district as temperature there has significantly increased. The crop pattern has changed drastically. Thus we have a number of scientific evidence to show clear signs of climate change in this part of the world. What the government should now do is properly document these climate change-induced incidents following internationally-accepted methods and present them at relevant UN bodies. \nNepal’s economy that has been facing one after another setbacks since the 2015 earthquake has been struggling to bounce back. Last week, two international agencies—the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB)—announced that Nepal’s economy was poised to improve in the upcoming fiscal year. In this context, the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Nara Bahadur Thapa, former executive director of the research department of Nepal Rastra Bank, to discuss the current state of the national economy. The ADB, in its report last week, anticipated Nepal’s economy to grow by 4.9 percent this fiscal. A few days earlier, a visiting IMF team also painted an improving picture of Nepal’s economy. How do you see these projections?Nepal’s economic growth in the past 2-3 years has remained below 5 percent. But successive governments in their fiscal budgets have been setting the target of 6 to 7 percent growth. Also, the budget this year has aimed for 6 percent growth. In the meantime, two donor agencies have painted an improving picture of our economy. The ADB has anticipated 4.9 percent growth. Also, the IMF’s team that visited Nepal on a fact finding mission has projected better prospects. They expected better yield from the agriculture sector as Nepal is witnessing more rains. Last year, the growth of agriculture was 3 percent. Now they expect the sector may grow by 3.5 to 4 percent and that may lift overall growth. They have cited improvement in tourism and increased energy export as other bases. Based on these grounds, the ADB has projected 4.9 percent economic growth. But even the target of 5 percent growth looks ambitious if you analyse economic data available as of now and the steps taken by government agencies. We have witnessed more rain but that doesn’t always do us good. More rain in the late monsoon often damages paddy at the time of harvest. Second, the heavy monsoon has caused huge losses in our infrastructure such as roads and bridges that are vital to keep the daily lives and trade running. This may impact potential economic growth as some vital highways and roads have been badly damaged. These factors may pose a challenge in achieving the targets set by the government and donor agencies. Another important factor is that the ratio of capital formation to GDP [gross domestic product] is consistently decreasing. It was 33.8 in the fiscal year 2018-19, it decreased to 30.5 in 2019-20, to 29.3 in 2020-21, 29.0 in 2021-22, 25.1 in 2022-23 and 24.5 in 2023-24. How can we expect economic growth when capital formation keeps decreasing. We can’t achieve 6 percent growth without first improving the situation of capital formation. Capital formation in the private sector is on a decline and the government hasn’t been able to boost it. On the other hand, capital expenditure was lower in the past fiscal year in comparison to the previous fiscal. There is no strong sign of increasing capital formation even in the coming year. This is because the government has failed to collect revenue as per its own target. The revenue collection ratio is falling. It has come down to 18 percent of GDP, from 22 percent not so long ago. With this, the government’s funding capacity is continuously declining. It has failed even to fulfil its own duties. For instance, it hasn’t been able to pay health insurance bills and or the contractors. Similarly, credit offtake from private banks to the private sector has not increased from 6 percent. It used to be around 15-16 percent. Also, no substantive initiatives have been taken to improve productivity. For this, government agencies have to cut red tape. The private sector isn’t optimistic. We are talking a lot but not working seriously to lay a strong ground for growth.What are the signs that private investors are pessimistic?There is enough liquidity in the banks, and the interest rate is decreasing, but the private sector is not borrowing. Bankers say there is no demand from the sector. This indicates pessimism. None of the big business houses have launched any big projects in recent times. The government talks a lot about the energy sector but it is not doing power purchase agreements (PPAs) with hydropower project developers. We aren’t doing enough to realise the goal of exporting 10,000MW electricity to India. This shows no serious effort is being made to initiate reforms. The capital market has required some urgent reforms. But the government hasn’t appointed office bearers in the regulatory body for the past seven months. The government hasn’t given permission to issue IPOs and FPOs. Hence, the government is keeping two important sectors—energy and capital market—on hold. All these trends and activities suggest it will be a challenge to achieve even moderate economic growth.You pointed to the policy hurdles but the multilateral agencies have hailed the government for policy reforms. The IMF in its statement has welcomed recent amendments to various laws and the ADB has welcomed “the cautiously accommodative monetary policy”. Don’t these statements reflect reality?While making their positions public, the international agencies follow certain norms and criteria. First, they take macro pictures such as the government’s commitments. They take the pledges made by the government in the investment summit seriously. They think the commitments will be implemented. Second, they don’t want to irk the host country by presenting a bleak picture because they are diplomats. They point out possible pitfalls during bilateral and table talks but present themselves diplomatically while making their official statements public.Remittance, tourism and energy export are taken as major bases for economic growth but all three depend on external factors. How reliable can the projection be?Without trading and increasing exports, we can’t progress economically. We need to export to increase production and create jobs. Export is an engine of economic growth. Anyhow, we must increase exports. About your query, the government should tackle such things by strengthening relations with the countries concerned and devise policies and strategies accordingly.Our economy is increasingly dependent on remittance. How risky is it in the long run?Remittance has become a boon for our economy. It has played a tremendous role in poverty reduction. The first Nepal Living Standard Survey (NLSS) conducted by the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS)—now the National Statistics Office—in 1995-96 showed 42 percent Nepali population living below the poverty line. The latest [fourth] living standard survey has shown the poverty level at 20 percent. It wouldn’t be possible without remittance. Therefore, we can’t undermine the role of remittance in this social transformation. Were not the government’s plans and policies responsible for this achievement?The government role would not have been enough. What government policies have created jobs in Nepal? Are there any schemes worth mentioning? The industrialisation hasn’t increased. It is the industrial sector that creates jobs but the share of the manufacturing sector has come down to 4.87 percent in total GDP. Some years ago, it was nearly 9-10 percent. It shows our economy is being deindustrialised. How can we reduce poverty without providing jobs to the youths? Thus, foreign employment played a vital role in poverty reduction. Second is the role of remittance in maintaining foreign exchange reserves, which is essential to buy things from abroad. We have sufficient foreign exchange reserves because of remittance.Information Technology is now projected as a promising sector in creating jobs and transforming Nepal’s economy. How realistic is this expectation?Four fields can be taken as promising sectors in Nepal—agriculture, tourism, IT and hydropower. The IT sector certainly has a bright future. As our country is land-locked, we have additional challenges in merchandise exports and we can’t be competitive. The IT sector won’t have that barrier so it can be competitive in the international market. But for that the government has to formulate IT-friendly policies. For instance, if a Kathmandu-based Nepali firm wants to sell services in the US, Europe or any other international market, they need liaison offices in those countries. Otherwise, they can’t be competitive and grow. But the government doesn’t provide foreign exchange for them to expand their business abroad.Without this policy reform, Nepalis can’t compete with IT companies from other countries. Similarly, foreign companies need to come and work here so that Nepali youths can learn from them. Foreign banks came to Nepal and Nepali bankers learned. Now Nepali banks are doing good. But our policies aren’t favourable for foreigners interested in setting up IT firms. Also, well-trained IT workers are in shortage. We are progressing but we have to put in extra effort to make transformative changes in this sector.The cooperatives’ scam has emerged as a serious issue. What impact may it cause in the national economy if it’s not resolved soon?The cooperative sector played a vital role in creating financial inclusion in our economy by making 7.3 million people its members. Those who couldn’t do their regular transactions with banks were engaged with cooperatives. If that sector collapses, our state of financial inclusion will decline too. Second, they were major financiers for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME). Cooperatives are directly linked to entrepreneurship through MSMEs. They played a role in making interest rates of banks more competitive as well as banks and financial institutions were under pressure by the interest rates offered by cooperatives. Now they won’t feel the pressure.In this context, many people may resort to informal transactions. According to the 16th periodic plan, nearly 50 percent of Nepal’s economy is informal. We are under pressure to reduce the portion of the informal economy. But the crisis in the cooperative sector may increase the informal economy as those who were involved in cooperatives, which is a formal sector, are likely to do informal transactions with traders or other individuals.Cooperatives are not well regulated and there are anomalies but they are registered in a government agency, pay taxes, have offices and a record system. They brought people in far-flung villages under a formal channel. If the depositors resort to individual transactions, their money will be unsafe. The constitution accepted them as one of the three pillars—along with the government and the private sector—of the country’s economy. The sector expanded its network where there were no economic activities from the government and private sectors. For instance, the government was providing certain services such as distributing fertilisers, crop seeds, sugar through cooperatives. People will now be deprived of these services. Also, the commercial banks might face complications due to the domino effect of the cooperative scam. For instance, if the government seizes the land put up by a cooperative as a collateral in a bank and sells it to return the deposits, the bank might be in trouble.It is also said that cooperatives were becoming platforms for money laundering. How serious was the problem?Cooperatives didn’t seek a source of money from the depositors while accepting big deposits. They weren’t affiliated to the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of the central bank and the Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT). Therefore, there is a problem of money laundering. It can be resolved when they get affiliated with the FIU.What initiatives should be taken to address the problems seen in the cooperative sector?A powerful regulatory authority should be established without delay. The authority should work as a dedicated agency to clear the mess. Then, AML/CFT provisions should be implemented, a credit information centre should be set up and a debt recovery tribunal formed, and deposits guaranteed. The concept of self-regulation isn’t enough. These financial infrastructures are essential. \nThe parliamentary special probe committee formed to investigate cooperatives scam submitted its report last week. The government has already started implementing the report. In this context, Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with the committee chair Surya Thapa for more insights on the probe’s findings and the anomalies in the cooperative sector they saw during the investigation.After your committee submitted the report on cooperatives scam, people have interpreted its findings in different ways. Why the confusion?Our committee prepared, finalised and endorsed the report unanimously. No member registered any dissent. This is an important point. However, people have interpreted its findings a bit differently. The supporters of [Rastriya Swatantra Party chair] Rabi Lamichhane have tried to make it appear like the report has given him a clean chit. They have selectively taken a certain portion of the report which states that Lamichhane’s involvement couldn’t be formally established in the process of transferring funds from cooperatives to the Gorkha Media Network. But a huge amount of money has been provided to the Gorkha Media Network from various cooperatives against the Cooperative Act 2017, which prohibits investment of cooperative deposits to any company. It is seen that Lamichhane is directly involved in spending the funds collected from the cooperatives. Based on that, we have found chair of the media company Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai, the then managing director Rabi Lamichhane, directors Chhabilal Joshi and Kumar Ramtel directly responsible in the misuse of cooperative funds and have asked the government to take action against them as per the existing laws. The aforementioned two aspects are inextricably linked. We didn’t find any evidence of transfer of cooperative funds to Lamichhane’s personal bank account. It is sent to the bank account of the Gorkha Media Network. The KYC form of the Global IME Bank shows that Lamichhane is one of the three holders of the joint account. Any one of the three can issue cheques from the account. The funds invested as loan in the Gorkha Media Network have been transferred to the joint bank account, from where Lamichhane has released money by signing cheques. This is how Lamichhane is directly involved in embezzlement of the cooperative funds. Many argue that as per the cooperative law only those who release money from the cooperatives are held responsible but not those who spend it after it is received at the company. Is that the case?The Cooperative Act 2017 prohibits releasing any loan to a company. But it is sent to the company, where Lamichhane is an owner with 15 percent share and a managing director. And, the money is misused there. An informal statement of GB Rai shows Rs1.20 billion of cooperative deposits has been invested in the media company while our financial analysis shows the amount is Rs654 million. Evidence shows Rs220 million has been directly sent to the media company’s bank account. Depositors have been deprived of their money. Other staff working at the company aren’t responsible but the owners are. They could be charged with cooperative fraud under the Cooperative Act, fraud and duping under the National Penal Code, organised crime cases under the Organised Crime Prevention Act, and money laundering cases under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. Some individuals involved with various cooperatives including Roshni Gurung of a Butwal-based cooperative told the committee that they deposited millions of rupees in the bank account of a person named Rabi Lamichhane. Kumar Ramtel said the person named Rabi Lamichhane is none other than the Rastriya Swatantra Party chair. Still, the committee couldn’t establish the link. What is the complication?The flow of the money shows the connection but documents to link the transactions are not available. We didn’t find documents with Lamichhane’s signatures and fingerprints that needed to be submitted to get a loan. All the seven cooperatives run by GB Rai were releasing loans without following due procedure. But we have successfully traced the flow of the money. The loan amount created in the name of Rabi Lamichhane in Butwal and deposited by Roshni Gurung had reached the Gorkha Media Network’s bank account which was jointly operated by GB Rai, Rabi Lamichhane and Chhabilal Joshi. This is an established fact. The committee didn’t find any document showing the flow of cooperative money to his personal account. But that alone is insufficient to give him a clean chit as a huge sum has been sent to the media company’s bank account jointly run by three people including Lamichhane. Another sum from the Supreme Cooperative has been deposited to the bank account of Gorkha Media Network. The bank voucher shows Roshni Gurung/Rabi Lamichhane as depositors. The amount also goes to the same joint account.Now the government has forwarded the report to the investigation agencies. Do you think the agencies can unearth the missing documents?Our committee worked in a different way to regular House committees. We followed methods of investigation just like the police investigation agencies and government’s prosecution agencies do. We recorded the suspects’ statements, took their fingerprints, and got the signatures to authenticate their statements. I believe this is a new practice by a Nepali parliamentary committee. Sufficient evidence has already been gathered in the past as well. While carrying out this task and preparing the 1,124-page document, we have followed the norms and procedures of an investigation body.During the interrogation, many suspects told the committee that they knew nothing and shifted the responsibility to GB Rai, who is on the run. Those from seven cooperatives–Hamro Nayakrishi Multipurpose Cooperatives; Swarnalaxmi; Supreme; Suryadarshan; Sahara; Samanata and Sano Paila and the officials from Gorkha Media Network gave such answers. Their common answer is, “I don’t know about this, GB Rai does.” Many of them might have been trying to evade their responsibility by blaming Rai. The government has failed to produce Rai. Won’t this investigation be incomplete in his absence?Based on its facts and evidence, the investigation report is complete. Yes, 29 suspects including GB Rai are at large. They are believed to be staying abroad. Their statements have not been recorded. But that doesn’t make the investigation incomplete. We have accessed the database of Gorkha Media Network and other cooperative organisations, collected important documents and analysed them. There is no confusion about the money embezzled in the scam. We have determined a total of Rs2.58 billion from various cooperatives has been misused by investing in several organisations including the Gorkha Media Network, Nature Nest, Nature Herbs, Gorkha Group of Investment, Gorkha Ayurved Company—49 people were responsible for these investments, including GB Rai. Of that, Rs654 million has been invested in Gorkha Media Network. A total of Rs8 billion has been embezzled in the seven cooperatives where Rai is involved. So the investigation is complete. During the interrogation, some office bearers of cooperatives claimed they had no role in the transactions as they were dummy officials and GB Rai and some individuals Rai trusted did everything. How convincing is that?The practice of creating dummy officials, fake documents, false marriages and divorces etcetera is rampant in the cooperative sector. In the seven cooperatives GB Rai is at the centre. He has at least one key person in each of these seven cooperatives as chair or manager and carries out everything through them. In some of them, the chairpersons know nothing. The cooperatives don’t follow any norms, rules and regulations of cooperatives. They work just on the basis of orders they get from Rai or his trusted individuals over the phone. Rai gets advice from a California-based individual named Gyan Bahadur Bamjan. The Cooperative Act prohibits an individual from being a member of more than one cooperative but Rai is involved in at least seven cooperatives as a chair, secretary, vice-chair or patron.The government has decided to implement the report. How should the state agencies work to bring good results?The government should immediately initiate action against four persons—Rabi Lamichhane, GB Rai, Chhabilal Joshi and Kumar Ramtel—as the report has found them responsible for misusing cooperative funds. We have also determined the roles and responsibilities of around 1,000 individuals who were chair, vice-chairs, secretaries, treasurers, account chiefs or others who in decision making roles in 40 cooperatives we were tasked to investigate. They should be brought under investigation and their properties should be seized so as to create an environment to return the depositors’ money.Different arrangements need to be made about those who are in judicial custody. They should be released, their all documents including passports seized and they should be kept under surveillance and allowed to take initiatives to return the depositors’ money. The government, while unveiling the fiscal budget, had announced to take initiatives to return deposits upto Rs500,000 by keeping cooperatives’ assets as collateral. This process should be expedited. Likewise, the government should set up an all-powerful regulatory authority. At present, all the 753 local governments, seven provincial governments and the federal government have the regulatory role. That is pointless. Now a strong dedicated regulatory authority should be formed. The Crisis-ridden Cooperatives Management Committee is there but it should be made more effective by giving it greater executive powers. When a cooperative is in crisis, the regulatory body should take over its management and fix the crisis just like Nepal Rastra Bank does in the banking sector.What patterns of anomalies did you find in the cooperatives?The fundamental idea of a cooperative is to run by its own members based on self-regulation. But a few board members were found to be using all the authority and misusing the funds while members were unaware about the affairs in the organisations. The board members use most of the resources for their relatives and other closed ones. Annual meetings are organised as picnics and wedding parties. In some cases, annual meetings are fake, audit reports, auditors and signatures, all are fake.In the course of preparing the committee report, I have coined terms like ‘cooperative divorce’ and ‘cooperative marriage’. Divorce and marriage documents are prepared based on the fortune of the cooperatives. There was misappropriation of Rs120 million in a cooperative, where Jyoti Gurung was manager, in 2075 BS. Dhan Raj Gurung, who is Nepali Congress Vice-president, divorced his wife Jyoti in 2076 BS. But, in 2077, Dhan Raj presented himself as a guarantor of a loan to Jyoti. Again in 2080, both of them jointly paid back a loan of Rs9.1 million. This is a bit of a trend in the cooperative sector.Do you think we need to reconsider the basic idea of cooperatives as self-regulated organisations?In the report, we haven’t questioned its principle, need and importance. Cooperative sector is vital for our economy. But the concept of self-regulation as stated in the Cooperative Act 2017 has failed. Now, this sector should be overseen by a strong regulatory body. Still, the idea of self-regulation can be given continuity as the members should be allowed to run the cooperatives on their own but their activities should be strictly regulated by a powerful authority. Moreover, the cooperatives that do big transactions should be regulated by the central bank.Why did the present regulatory bodies fail?There were over 50 lawmakers who proudly identified themselves as office bearers of certain cooperatives. They over-emphasised self-regulation and undermined the role of regulatory bodies. Individuals like GB Rai and other fraudsters benefited from that. Therefore, we recommended stringent laws and a stronger regulatory authority. \nThe Meteorological Forecasting Division said on Wednesday that Nepal’s hilly areas will experience partly cloudy skies, while the rest of the country is expected to have mostly fair weather.Light rain, accompanied by thunder and lightning, is likely in isolated areas of Koshi and Gandaki provinces.
