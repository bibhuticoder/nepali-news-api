Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nCPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli was sworn in as the prime minister of Nepal for the fourth time amid a function at the President’s Office in Sheetal Niwas on Monday. President Ramchandra Paudel administered the oath of office and secrecy to Prime Minister Oli. President Paudel on Sunday had appointed Oli as the prime minister under Article 76 (2) of the constitution as there were no other claimants for the post. After CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the immediate past prime minister, was unable to secure the trust of the House of Representatives during a floor test on Friday, President Paudel had invited political parties to form a new government under Article 76 (2) of the constitution on the same evening, setting a Sunday deadline for submitting claims at the President’s Office.With no other contender, Oli had in his support submitted the signatures of 166 lawmakers (Nepali Congress’ 88 and UML’s 78). The minimum number needed to form a government is 138 in the 275-strong House of Representatives.Soon after the swearing-in ceremony on Monday, Prime Minister Oli formed a full 22-member Cabinet, including two deputy prime ministers. Among the 22 members including the prime minister, 10 are from the Congress, while nine represent the UML. The other parties in the Cabinet are the Janata Samajabadi Party (JSP), led by Ashok Rai, and Loktantrik Samajbadi Party (LSP), which have two and one ministries, respectively. Shortly after Oli’s swearing-in, President Paudel also administered the oath of office and secrecy to the newly appointed ministers. Based on Article 76 (9) of the constitution, President Paudel, on the recommendation of the prime minister, administered the oath of office and secrecy to the ministers.Article 76 (9) stipulates that the President shall, on the recommendation of the prime minister, constitute the Council of Ministers comprising a maximum of 25 ministers, including the prime minister, in accordance with the inclusive principle from among the members of federal Parliament.Despite the Article based on which the prime minister recommended the ministers clearly stating that the council of ministers should be in line with the inclusive principle, that is not the case.In the 25-member council of ministers, Prime Minister Oli can still appoint three ministers.“The prime minister still can appoint three full Cabinet ministers or ministers of state to fulfil the requirement enshrined by the constitution for the council of ministers,” Purnaman Shakya, a professor of constitutional law, told the Post. “But ministers of state can only participate in Cabinet meetings in the absence of their line ministers.”In Monday’s Cabinet, Prakash Man Singh of the Congress and Bishnu Prasad Paudel of the UML were inducted as deputy prime ministers. They will also head the Ministry of Urban Development and the Ministry of Finance, respectively.In the 22-member Cabinet formed under Oli’s leadership, there are only two women. There is no representation from the Dalit and Muslim communities.In the 22-member Cabinet, 13 are from the Khas Arya community, and there are three members from Janajati and five from Madheshi communities.Nepal has incorporated proportional representation and inclusion as integral parts of the constitution. This was done to prevent the overrepresentation of one community at the policy-making level. But the country has failed to abide by its charter.“What an irony! Not a single Dalit get a berth in the new Cabinet formed by the so-called champions of inclusive democracy,” Lokraj Baral, a professor of political science, wrote on social media.Likewise, Bhimarjun Acharya, a constitutional expert, also questioned the new Cabinet's inclusiveness.“Everyone did a lot of politics in the name of Dalits, and the communists even more so. Dalits were not given any place in yesterday’s government led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal nor in today’s government led by Oli,” Acharya wrote on social media. “I request that Dalits be represented in the Council of Ministers immediately.” When the Post questioned Dalit members of the Congress and the UML parties, they said they were not the right people to comment on the issue.As per the National Population and Housing Census 2021, 13.2 percent of the national population are Dalits while Muslims comprise 4.86 percent of the population.Yet Dalit activists find fault with this silent approach. It is precisely because the Dalit politicians do not strongly raise the issue of their inclusion that this trend prevails, they say.“There are a few other reasons why Dalits are sidelined from mainstream politics. One is because of a weakened Dalit movement,” Purna Darnal, a Dalit activist, told the Post. “When the Maoist Centre, a political party that championed inclusiveness in Nepali politics, refused to be inclusive in the Cabinet formed in their leadership, why would other parties do so?”Darnal added that it is a matter of shame that the two biggest parties in the country practice such blatant exclusion while choosing ministers.Nine of the 10 ministers from the Congress are male. When dividing them into clusters, seven are Khas Arya, and one each are Janajati, Tharu and Madheshi.Likewise, eight of the nine ministers of UML are male. Six are from the Khas Arya community, two are Janajati, and one is a Madheshi. \nNewly appointed foreign minister Arzu Rana has said that boundary disputes should be resolved through facts and evidence, avoiding unnecessary conflicts with neighbouring countries.While taking charge of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Monday, Rana, the country’s fourth foreign minister, said unlike in the past, it is no longer necessary to take decisions on boundary issues solely based on the inspection of border pillars.“We will resolve the boundary dispute with India based on geography, history and new scientific maps prepared on the basis of the global positioning system [GPS]. We have more information, facts and evidence now than in the past, so there is no need to bicker over which boundary pillar was where,” Rana told reporters after assuming the office of foreign minister. “The facts are there, so we can resolve all our border issues,” she said. “As per my briefing, the Mahakali serves as a border river, and both countries [Nepal and India] have access to it, so there is always a dispute.” “This is a transboundary issue, which we must clearly understand. Hopefully, something will happen in our lifetime. Resolution to the problem will be found on the basis of geography, history and GPS. There’s no magic solution. As I said, we are in a delicate geopolitical location so must act very carefully. We have survived as a nation for a long time, and need to continue to do so, not just for today or tomorrow, but for thousands of years,” said Rana. Prior to Rana, three women, namely Bimala Rai Poudyal, Sujata Koirala, and Sahana Pradhan, had taken charge of the foreign ministry.Rana, the spouse of Nepali Congress chief and former prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, has worn several hats in the past, including experience in social fields and parliamentary affairs. Nepal has a longstanding boundary dispute with India, and ongoing issues with China. Due to the lack of joint inspection since 2006, officials do not have records of such disputes on the northern border.“Regarding Kalapani, Limpiyadhura and Lipulek, we can sit with India and reach a resolution,” said the foreign minister, who will face daunting foreign policy challenges in the rapidly changing geopolitical landscape. On the first day of her office, the minister was asked how she would address boundary issues with India. She said geopolitics is a complex issue, and she does not rely on magic to resolve such disputes.She described her new role as “historic” and said she would use the opportunity in a constructive way.Rana stressed the importance of preserving Nepal’s legacy of never being colonised. “Ours is a small, landlocked country situated between two giants, so we have to maintain balanced relations with all,” she added. “Our ancestors have protected our country throughout history. The legacy must be upheld for generations to come.” Rana also stated that she plans to focus on executing economic diplomacy and implementing international treaties, agreements and commitments. Also, she committed to secure the repatriation of Nepali youths serving in the Russian Army, and to initiating efforts for the safe release of Bipin Joshi, who is believed to be in Hamas captivity since October 7 last year. \nNandaram Mahar’s family of seven haven’t had a good night’s sleep for the past month or so. The family is currently living at a temporary shelter in Nalgad Municipality-4 of Jajarkot district. What was already an arduous stay got worse after the start of the monsoon—the temporary hut struggles to keep out even normal rain if it continues for some hours, Mahar says. And when it rains, the food grains and clothes get wet.Mahar’s family relocated to the hut after the November 3 earthquake damaged their home. So moving back to the home is not an option, Mahar says. “The earthquake has weakened the land around the village, so the fear of landslides keeps us awake at night,” he says. “Now that it has started raining heavily, we have no option but to stay awake all night.”Mahar’s is not the only family that has had to battle monsoon with very few resources. The government has identified a total of 48,517 families in need of rehabilitation in the 6.4 magnitude earthquake. As many as 34,954 temporary shelters have been constructed so far. The rest of the families are forced to stay either in the flimsy tarpaulin tents or staying in the old house damaged by the quake.Chief District Officer of Jajarkot Umakant Adhikari said that since June, the details of 24,557 families have been included in the disaster management protocol. According to him, after releasing the second tranche of the housing reconstruction aid to build temporary huts, the amount is being distributed through the respective ward offices.Similarly, the second tranche has been released to 16,000 earthquake displaced families in Rukum West. Chief District Officer of Rukum West Hari Prasad Pant said that Rs400 million was sent to the local level account as second instalment for the construction of temporary housing. According to him, 32,006 beneficiaries have been recorded throughout the district. He informed that an additional budget has been requested from the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority to provide funds to the rest.The earthquake victims complain that they are hugely affected by the monsoon rains. Lal Bahadur Mahar of Bheri Municipality-1 said that the clothes and food that gets wet when it rains have to be brought outside and dried when the sun shines. According to him, some families of the village risked their lives as they returned to the cracked houses. “The roof is constantly leaking,” he said. “It is very difficult to live here.”Many earthquake victims are taken ill in several settlements of earthquake affected districts of Jajarkot, Rukum West and Salyan. Children, senior citizens and patients of chronic diseases are the hardest hit. “Due to the intense heat and rain, the victims of the earthquake began to fall ill rapidly,” said Dr Priya Shahi of Basic Hospital in Chhedagadh. According to him, 50 to 100 patients come to the hospital daily for treatment of diarrhoea, fever, typhoid and pneumonia. He informed that almost 60 percent of those who come to the hospital are children.As per the record available at the district hospital in Jajarkot, around 150 people visit the health facility on a daily basis.The earthquake displaced people are exposed to monsoon-induced disasters. At present, most of the earthquake victims have built temporary housing near forests, riverbanks, edges of their farmland and on steep land. “Many of the quake-displaced families are at high risk of floods and landslides,” said Nar Bahadur Nepali, general secretary of Nepal Red Cross Society in Karnali Province. “The quake victims faced health problems during the cold winter and hot summer days. Now they are left at the risk of floods and landslides.”According to geologist Chandan Giri, there is a high risk of landslides in the areas affected by the earthquake. He said the risk of landslides is almost 80 percent higher after an earthquake than in other normal situations. After the earthquake, a team of five technicians led by him studied some villages in Nalgad, Bheri municipalities and Barekot Rural Municipality of Jajarkot and found that the land around various settlements was torn. “There is a risk of erosion and large landslides in those cracked areas,” he said, warning about the huge loss of lives and properties.The local people complained that the authorities concerned are indifferent about their hardships. However, Rabilal Sharma, secretary of Internal Affairs and Ministry of Law of Karnali Province, said that they have started preparation after studying the risk of landslides in the earthquake-affected settlements. According to him, all security mechanisms have been readied to minimise possible risks.16 families displaced due to the risk of landslidesAs the risk of landslides is looming large, 16 families of Chaupani in Bheri Municipality-1 have been displaced. The ward office has transferred 11 families to a nearby school, four families have moved to India while one family is taking shelter in a relative’s house, according to Deepak Rana, ward chair of Bheri Municipality-1.The district administration claims that it has carried out necessary initiatives to protect the quake-displaced people from the water-induced disasters. Adhikari, the Jajarkot CDO, said that a police team under the command of Assistant Sub-Inspector of Nepal Police has been mobilised to identify the families who are at high risk. “The families at risk are being searched and shifted to safer locations timely,” he added. \nChickens cannot fly far enough, but the price of eggs is flying through the roof.An egg now costs Rs22.50 in retail, up from Rs17 a year earlier, according to the poultry association. Nutritionists say this is not good news for consumers hit by inflation who tend to cut budgets for healthy diets due to low income.When eggs become expensive, it affects consumers in all brackets—from restaurants to bakeries and from canteens to households.In Nepal, millions of consumers rely heavily on eggs to meet their protein intake due to expensive meat.According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), humble eggs offer a practical and impactful opportunity to tackle problems related to undernutrition.Eggs are almost pure protein of very high quality. They also provide the entire Adequate Intake of vitamin B12 and choline for young children. The essential fatty acid content of eggs may be necessary in pregnancy. Eggs are popular in many countries and are available at affordable prices.“Most Nepalis have folic acid deficiency. The egg is one of the good sources of folate, including protein and vitamins, and is easy for people of any age to digest,” said Dr Sudhashree Adhikari, a nutritionist. “With a price hike, the egg will be out of reach for many people, which might cause protein deficiency. An egg fulfils around 10 grams of protein intake.”Growing children, including pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers, need more protein for growth and development. “The lack of protein hinders the growth and development of children, including muscle growth,” Adhikari said.A whole egg contains Vitamin A, Vitamin B9, Vitamin B5, Vitamin B12, Vitamin B2, Vitamin D, E, B6, minerals—phosphorus, selenium, calcium and zinc. Daily consumption of eggs might lower the risk of stroke. The antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin in eggs help prevent eye diseases like cataracts and age-related muscle degeneration. Choline in eggs is essential for pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers, as it helps the baby’s brain development.“A healthy adult can eat 1–2 eggs daily without hesitation. A whole egg contains almost all the nutrients a body needs,” Dr Atul Upadhyay, another nutritionist, told the Post in a recent interview.Recently, the retail price of eggs increased twice a month as the Nepal Layers Poultry Association hiked the farmer price, ultimately increasing the retail price.Binod Poharel, president of Nepal Layers Poultry Association, said the retail price of an egg is Rs22.50 now. Pokharel said that the price of eggs was increased as farmers could not recover the production cost for a long time due to the rise in feed prices. The farm gate price of an egg ranges from Rs14-16 per piece, but due to the multiple layers of middlemen, it becomes expensive when it reaches the consumer’s hand, traders said.FAO, the specialised agency of the United Nations that leads international efforts to defeat hunger, has set the per capita per year requirement of eggs in developing countries at 48 units. A person's requirement for meat, a source of protein, is 14 kg per year, while the requirement for milk is 91 litres.According to data from Nepal’s agriculture ministry, a Nepali eats 18.1 kg of meat and 61 eggs annually, well above the benchmark set by the UN body. The consumption of milk currently stands at 79 litres, still short by 12 litres.Per capita meat consumption was 9.8 kg per year in 2008 and 9.7 kg in 2000.Adhikari said that eggs are cheap and easy-to-find food that fulfils protein and vitamin needs better than plant-based proteins, different varieties of legumes, meat, and fish.Adhikari said the government needs to provide relief on such food products so that many people can access them. “When there is food inflation, and people’s incomes are not increasing, they will reduce their consumption.”According to the association, egg production this summer has declined to 2.5 million units daily from 6 million in 2023.“There is a gap between demand and supply as production gets hit in the summer season,” said Pokharel. “Also, many poultry farmers are leaving the industry after their businesses were hit badly by the Covid pandemic followed by high bank interest rates.”Consumer rights activists said traders hiked the price of eggs on the pretext that farmers kept a good profit margin for themselves. Prem Lal Maharjan, president of the National Consumer Forum, said poultry farmers do not benefit from the hiked price, as all the money goes into the pockets of traders or middlemen.Medium egg, which used to cost Rs430 per crate (30 pieces), now costs Rs530, a hike of Rs100 in a month.“This is not a justifiable hike. Traders are profiteering from it, not the farmers,” said Maharjan.Maharjan said that, earlier, two organisations fixed the price of eggs—the Egg Producers Association and the Nepal Layers Association. The price used to be competitive. “But now both organisations have merged. There is a monopoly,” he said, according to the Consumer Protection Act, 2018. The rise in egg prices is a big blow for consumers who have seen vegetable prices double and triple due to the monsoon disasters, which have affected output and cut the supply chain. Almost all seasonal vegetables have joined the Rs100 per kg club.    \nNepal national women’s cricket team defeated Sri Lanka Women Development Squad by two runs in their third T20 practice match in Surrey Village in Maggona on Tuesday.Indu Barma’s team bundled out Sri Lanka Women Development Squad, who were chasing 113, for 110 in 19.5 overs, with Kabita Joshi taking 3-16 and Kritika Marasini returning the match figures of 2-16.The win also prevented the host team from sweeping the three-match series. Nepal had lost the first T20 warm up game by 33 runs and the second by four wickets.Balasuriya top scored for Sri Lanka Development Squad with 38 runs off 36 balls, while Nethranjali made 26 facing 20 deliveries. Sri Lanka collapsed early when Kabita Kunwar trapped opener Karindi leg in front in the third over and Chhetri ran out Wijesinghe in the fourth over. Balasuriya steadied the ship, and with support from Nethranjali, the host team looked destined for another victory.But once Joshi dismissed Balasuriya in the 16th over and Nethranjali in the 18th, the Lankans’ hopes of completing a clean sweep faded.Skipper Barma also took a wicket.Earlier, Nepal posted 112-6 from 20 overs after choosing to bat first, thanks to Rubina Chhetri who revived Nepal’s innings after suddenly collapsing in the eighth over.Samjhana Khadka (10 off 20) and Sita Rana Magar (15 off 23) added 31 runs for the opening wicket to give Nepal a good start. Nepal found themselves in big trouble at 33-3 when they lost three quick wickets, including both openers, to Thennakone (2-21) in the eighth over.Bindu Rawal and Barma offered some resistance but the skipper too fell in the 13th over that left Nepal reeling at 52-4.But Chhetri partnered with Rawal to defy the Sri Lankan bowlers and guided Nepal past 100. Chhetri hit 37 runs off 26 balls, while Rawal contributed 20 off 31 balls.The victory will be a huge boost for Nepal ahead of their ACC Women’s T20 Asia Cup, which is set to begin on July 19.Nepal have been drawn in a tough group alongside the tournament’s most successful side and defending champions India, two-time runners up Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates.Nepal, who are still looking to register their first win at the biennial competition, will open their Asia Cup against the United Arab Emirates on Friday. They face Pakistan on July 21 and India on July 23.Nepal are making their third appearance at the Asia Cup. \nThe National Examinations Board (NEB) has announced that the Grade 12 results will be published by the end of July.Jung Bahadur Aryal, secretary of the NEB, said preparations are underway to publish the results soon.“Our goal is to release the results by the end of July, and it’s possible it could happen sooner,” he said. The board said it has received answer sheets from across the country and is currently engaged in the process of tallying marks and entering them in the system.A total of 390,847 students, including 196,914 females and 193,933 males, from 5,542 schools sat for this year’s exams held from April 26 to May 8. There were 1,526 designated exam centres, including one in Japan. This year, for the first time, the NEB used an automatic selection system to determine the examination centres in Kathmandu. \nLocal authorities are coordinating with officials from bordering Indian districts to recover the bodies of those missing in the Simaltal accident, where a landslide swept two buses into the Trishuli River last Friday.The search is being conducted in coordination with authorities of the Indian states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar after some bodies of the missing persons were found on Narayani riverbanks near the Indian border.Nepali authorities believe the flooded river might have taken the bodies to India.Chief District Officer (CDO) of Chitwan Indradev Yadav said they are coordinating with the district magistrates of Maharajgunj in Uttar Pradesh and West Champaran in Bihar. Both magistrates have been requested to inform Nepali authorities if they find any bodies in the river, but no bodies have been located yet.Although the CDO has the authority to coordinate with the bordering Indian districts, formal communication must go through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.Meanwhile, rescuers have deployed sonar cameras to search for the missing people and the wreckage of the two buses. These cameras can help the rescue teams in locating the buses and the victims underwater. A technical team, including engineers from the Armed Police Force Headquarters, has arrived at the incident site to search for the missing people.According to the Superintendent of Police Janak Puri at the Disaster Management Training School at Kurintar, they deployed new high-tech cameras on Monday.SP Puri said the new cameras can fetch data and capture pictures from depths up to 300 metres.“The sonar cameras used earlier could only detect whether there was an object in the water. But the current cameras provide detailed shape of the object and are effective even in murky conditions,” he said.However, operating the motorboat is difficult when the water current is very strong, he said, adding that they would search as far as Golaghat, 50 km downstream from the incident site.The rescue team searched for two kilometres downstream on Monday, but could not locate anything.APF Sub Inspector Ramesh Bahadur Thapa, who has spent 12 years as a rescue diver in Kurintar, has been tirelessly searching for the missing passengers and buses.“We don’t have a problem with the depth of the river. However, since the water is very murky, visibility is almost zero. With such strong water currents, the risk is also heightened,” said Thapa. He said that despite these challenges, the divers are giving continuity to their search.According to Chitwan CDO Yadav, 12 divers from the Armed Police Force and five from the Nepal Army have been deployed for the search.So far, 17 bodies have been found in different places and the identities of 10 bodies have been ascertained.A task force formed by the Ministry of Home Affairs on Monday is scheduled to visit the accident site on Wednesday.Sixty-two people went missing after two passenger buses were swept away by a mudslide into the rain-swollen Trishuli River near Simaltal along the Narayanghat-Mugling road section at around 3:30am on Friday. \nNepal is not even halfway through this monsoon, and the rain has already brought deadly floods and landslides. As per official records, from June 10 to July 14, a total of 108 people have died, many more have been injured, and 3,552 families have been displaced across the country. The death toll is likely to mount as more bodies surface from the recent tragic Simaltal incident on the Mugling-Narayanghat road section (also called Madan Ashrit Highway), where a landslide swept two buses carrying 65 people into Trishuli River last week. It is unfortunate that our efforts to prevent human loss have been far from satisfactory. Constant politicking, lack of preparedness and a culture of dismissing expert research and suggestions on road construction all make monsoons a perfect storm of disasters. Take the Mugling-Narayanghat road. The road was widened without factoring in its geographical vulnerability and landslide risks, and the landslides there have only gotten worse in the past few years. Moreover, haphazard roads built above the major roads throughout the country have put many lives in danger, as happened during the Simaltal incident. As per a Setopati report, the debris flow brought about by the road construction in the settlements above the Simaltal area reportedly resulted in the incident.Geologists have consistently raised concerns about the risks associated with the highway; however, their words have fallen on deaf ears. In June of this year, the landslide risk assessment flagged 11 areas on the highway as zones that needed immediate study and 25 areas as prone to landslides. Similarly, according to Kaski district’s Disaster Response Plan (as reported by Himalkhabar), 25 settlements are in danger of flood and landslide in Pokhara Metropolitan City. As a part of their disaster preparedness, each district is mandated to prepare a disaster response plan. Despite this, when the time comes to act, they lack the necessary human resources, equipment, or budgetary support to prevent disasters and rescue people. We don’t have to look far to see how the country’s disaster preparedness has failed—Simaltal has received major attention in terms of rescue yet, as of now, neither the buses that were swept away nor most of those missing have been found. When it comes to dealing with disasters, our authorities have always adopted a wait-and-see approach. The Home Ministry, responsible for overseeing national disaster preparedness, issued a notice on preventive measures, including suspending the plying of vehicles at night in high-risk areas, only after the tragic incident on the Mugling-Narayanghat highway. These measures could still prove beneficial, but we need a long-term solution and pre-planning. As local governments are still ill-prepared to handle pre-disaster preparedness as well as post-disaster rescue efforts, it is up to the federal government to equip the community level bodies with enough budget and equipment. We have had enough of these life-threatening disasters. Even though it is already late, all three levels of government must heed the experts, engineers and geologists when constructing or widening roads. The much-needed slope stabilisation through bio-engineering should be done on the Mugling-Narayanghat highway and other risky paths without further delay. The governments should also prioritise rigorous monitoring and follow-ups on road construction. We cannot afford to lose any more lives to these disasters. \nThe first edition of the Nepal Living Standards Survey (NLSS-I) 1995-96 aimed to create “unique opportunities to assess the poverty situation in the country and carry out many other research works by providing a large database at a single reference point.” Simultaneously, the survey operation aimed to contribute to the capacity building of the then Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) in conducting sample surveys. In a sense, it was an experimentation and training opportunity created for the next generation of sample survey researchers. This, therefore, had obvious caveats on the robustness of its outcomes and usability of inferences.Last month, the National Statistical Office (NSO), the rebaptised CBS, published a report of the fourth edition of the Survey (NLSS-IV) 2023-24. The original objective of the NLSS to “assess the poverty situation” does not seem to have changed. However, in nearly three decades of exercises that published three editions—1996, 2004 and 2011—this government entity seems to have barely learned to conduct such sample-based surveys, improve its inferential credibility, and maintain research integrity while working with a disproportionately small sample of a large population.Unrepresentative samplingNo doubt, sample surveys, as against population surveys, are risky and can provide only indicative inference even if they are implemented with utmost professionalism and high precision research. Otherwise, they suffer from self-selection bias and inferential misrepresentation due to underrepresentation of data variation. Besides, creating a mini sample from an already available population dataset to inquire into the topic that the population sample itself could carry out better is a redundant exercise and a misuse of resources. First, the NLSS rituals on top of the National Census do not add any value to better understanding the country's socioeconomic realities. Second, the authenticity of small-sized sample surveys like the NLLS can be established if, and only if, their statistical outcomes are consistent with those of comprehensive surveys like censuses. The NLSS exercises have failed on both counts.For the NLSS-IV, data was collected from a sample of 9,600 out of 6.761 million households, or 0.14 percent. When it is disaggregated into selected 15 geographical domains, the average number of households surveyed in each domain is only 640. This is certainly a gross underrepresentation to statistically infer anything meaningful. For example, the NLSS-IV claims the proportion of households in Nepal receiving remittance income has reached 76.8 percent. It also argues that it is a dramatic increase from 23.4 percent in 1996 and 56.8 percent in 2011. Nevertheless, it is not only inconsistent with the National Census 2021 data but also does not reflect the actual ground reality. Inferential flawsThe Census 2021 states that the total number of individuals absent from home, possibly to be in a foreign country, is only 2.169 million. It is next to impossible to receive remittances by 5.192 million (76.8 percent of 6.761 million households recognised by the Census) households sent by only 2.169 million migrating individuals, including seasonal absentees. Among them, even if only one individual from each household is considered out of home and remits the earnings back, only 32 percent of the households are likely to receive any kind of remittance. The direct positive correlation between the outmigration of individuals and remittance income can no way be undermined or ruled out.There were similar inconsistencies in NLSS-2011 and Census-2011. The Census stated that the population away from the country then was only 1.921 million, while the NLSS-III claimed that nearly 57 percent of the 5.7 million households benefitted from the remittance receipts. As such, which inferences and conclusions should people believe in and use—the Census or the NLSS, both published by the same agency? There seems to be a great deal of confusion even in defining what essentially constitutes the 'remittance' for the purpose of this report.Even in determining the poverty line and poverty-related indicators—the sole stated objective of the NLSS exercise—both the data and inferences are messy, to say the least. It has adopted a new poverty line using 2022/23 as the base year. The updated line marginally increases the minimum income bar. A Nepali citizen is now classified as poor if her annual per capita total consumption expenditure is less than NRs72,908 annually, or Rs200 (USD 1.5 at 1 USD=NPR 133) per day. The report, at one instance, claims that Nepal has seen a significant reduction in poverty headcount over the last 12 years, from 25.16 percent in 2010-11 to 3.57 percent (vis-a-vis 2011 inflation-adjusted poverty line) in 2022-23. In the next paragraph, it says, “20.27 percent of the population in Nepal lives below the new poverty line”.The definitional relation in practice between the 'headcount' and the 'poverty line' is that the 'national poverty headcount ratio is the percentage of the population living below the national poverty line.' Then how do the claims that poverty declined to 3.57 percent while 20.27 percent of the population still languish below the poverty line by earning only USD 1.5 dollars a day stand together? Regardless of these purely data doctoring or data cooking machinations, the critical question is: Whether the poverty rate actually declined in reality or not.Extrapolations and excusesThese are only a few examples of research by a government agency that is dependent on a small set of data while resources are disproportionately used in clever tabulation and preparation of politically convenient reports to show progress in critical topics like poverty reduction. No research finding should be only a circus of data overexploitation and far-fetched extrapolation like this. Whenever the discrepancies in research outcomes of government agencies are called out, the instant response is to point fingers towards methodological differences or biased perceptions. Also, the “we are the government” mindset runs deep to prove their findings as sacrosanct and beyond question.Nepal is pathetically handicapped in data-based research. There is a clear dearth of institutions in the country, academic or otherwise, that have the technical capacity and financial resources to carry out large-scale, nationwide research to counter the spuriousness of many such government surveys and research outcomes. International development partners, for instance, the World Bank, which has been supporting the NLSS endeavours since the beginning in 1995, have hardly paid any attention to the fact that the effective presence of autonomous research institutions out of government influence can better contribute to national policymaking. A plethora of survey-based research norms and practices, specifically in government-owned agencies, must change now. \nA recent study report on the Nepali media landscape by the International Research & Exchanges Board (IREX), an American nonprofit, describes our media as “somewhat vibrant”. I haven’t been able to locate their full report on their site yet, but I find the phrasing for the overall score rather intriguing—Nepali media is vibrant but not as vibrant. Nepal scored 23 out of 40 overall for the four measures: Information quality, channels, consumption and engagement, and transformative action.I checked for how they define the term somewhat vibrant, with a score of 21 to 30, and this is what I found: “Quality information is available in this country and most of it is editorially independent, based on facts, and not intended to harm. There are sufficient resources for content production, but some groups may not be well-represented, and some media may struggle financially. Most people have the rights, means, and capacity to access a wide range of information, although some do not. Most people recognize and reject misinformation, although some do not…”The positive terms above, including international media headlines describing Nepal’s performance as satisfactory, might surprise average media users who generally criticise our media as failures lacking quality and breath. These words also contrast with the negative perception, and, to be precise, they suggest a \"mostly vibrant\" rather than a \"somewhat vibrant\" media environment.Over the years, I have described our media as vibrant, even \"very vibrant\", mainly for their assertiveness and persistence despite many challenges. The USAID-funded study essentially serves as a barometer to guide US development efforts in the country. It comes as a critique highlighting geographic disparity, caste-based leadership and a predominance of political coverage over crucial developmental issues such as inclusion and climate change in our media. What is particularly interesting and valuable about the report is that it integrates perceptions of editors and professionals from across the entire information ecosystem, including news and other forms of media.Quality issueDespite widespread perceptions, instances of Nepali media lapses are sporadic and occur as exceptions rather than the rule. Still, these issues are serious for hard-core journalism, if not for social media sites with varied media ethics or lax professionalism. They serve as a test of the civic significance of news media. At this juncture, journalism and social media alike face the dual challenge of innovating while maintaining the highest level of quality and integrity. News outlets, including traditional ones, have explored innovations in multimedia, podcasting and interactive visuals, but social media platforms lead in innovation. Traditional outlets still prioritise textual storytelling, and some shine in their long-forms and commentaries. Legacy media and online news portals are generally reluctant to innovate substantially, with multimedia efforts often failing to fully realise their potential. They are hindered by the need to \"feed the beast\"—meeting deadlines and sustaining portals with breaking news or live reports without much context.Enhanced diversity in content and inclusive coverage are critical needs. News platforms, generally known for their rigorous and verified reporting, should move beyond their predominant focus on social and political dramas to prioritise in-depth and comprehensive stories. Independent social media creators, known for their emphasis on sensational and controversial content but proficient in live reporting and specialising in niche subjects such as travel or educational vlogging, should strive to provide greater contextual depth. YouTubers and Facebook Live broadcasters have become significant players in our information ecosystem, impacting people’s perception of journalism itself. Podcasting and talk shows are on the rise but often lack the editorial oversight, news values and ethical guidelines necessary to be considered legitimate journalism. While they may exhibit some attributes of journalism—such as news portals, screaming headlines, and emphasis on currency—their authenticity is frequently questioned. Specific content from these sites is often criticised for unverified information, misleading narratives, and even misinformation. This issue, however, is not unique to Nepal.Understanding audience behaviour through ongoing research is also crucial. Are our audiences genuinely segmented, gravitating towards specific content types, or are they merely hopping around different content without much loyalty? Legacy media could attract more audiences through self-help, utility, or explainer journalism, but their mainstay remains news and current affairs.Overall, today, we have more journalism, both quantitatively and qualitatively, than in the past. However, compared to other forms of media content like entertainment, advertisement, publicity, and propaganda, journalism remains a small fraction. Perceptions of trust in media are often shaped by public misunderstanding of journalism's civic role amidst the increasing degradation of information in the digital age. The belief that anyone with digital access can perform journalistic tasks like content creation overlooks the meticulous methods and verification standards true journalists adhere to. In contrast, amateur content creators routinely rely on incomplete information. Nepali media must encourage creativity and uphold professional standards to foster true innovation. Simply focusing on content is insufficient. There is a notable deficiency in professional, technical, and managerial skills, especially in social marketing for engagement. Media outlets should invest in and cultivate dedicated storytelling teams. Training for journalists should go beyond news production to encompass new media skills and technical proficiency in design, engineering, production, audience engagement, verification and fact-checking. Competence in content marketing and management is equally crucial.The most discerning audiences still and often find legacy media more credible than other sources. The real issue lies in legacy media losing paid subscriptions, ad venues, and sponsorships to social media platforms. This shift has resulted in newsrooms being downsized, leaving novice reporters with little investment in innovation and training. The entire industry seems to be in disarray, and the market has lost its self-correcting powers.A systemic approach is required to bounce back, including policy reforms and partnerships with new media platforms. Journalism, as a public interest enterprise, is too precious to be left entirely to the market. The future of Nepali media hinges on its ability to innovate, diversify, and maintain the trust and engagement of its audience. \nKP Sharma Oli begins his fourth term as prime minister with a bit of baggage. Most infamously, during his third term, when the time came to hand over his prime ministership to his coalition partner as earlier agreed, Oli chose to dissolve the House of Representatives—twice—rather than voluntarily give up power. Thankfully, the Supreme Court stepped in to avert an untimely election. Rightly or not, Oli has over the years built a reputation for wheeling and dealing and for surrounding himself with yes-men. He is not someone comfortable reaching across the aisle. In fact, his stubborn and acerbic nature has made it easy for others, including his coalition partners during previous terms, to take offence. At 72 and in iffy health, Oli is also seen as someone whose time in Nepali politics has come and gone. On the external front, too, challenges galore. In recent times, ‘China’s man in Nepal’, as dubbed by the Indian media, has had a difficult relationship with New Delhi. Of course, he must be lauded for taking a dogged stand against the 2015-16 Indian blockade. But then Oli started spouting all kinds of nonsense like claiming that Lord Ram was born in Thori of Nepal rather than Ayodhya of India, unnecessarily needling the powerful BJP establishment. These are big hurdles no doubt. But they are not insurmountable. During the latest negotiations with Congress leaders, for instance, he is reported to have assured them that he has ‘matured’ and will refrain from taking juvenile steps like dissolving the House on a whim. He is also someone strongly wedded to the idea of a two-party polity, a strategy that suits many in the Congress just fine. (Whether it suits the country is a different thing.) As the agreement between the two big parties in the lead up to the formation of the new government is yet to be made public, it is hard to make definite predictions. Yet if Oli can channel his strong character to use the over two-thirds majority in the House for productive purposes, he can get a lot done. On India too, Oli was for long known as someone with personal rapport with top Indian leaders—and he still has the confidence and capacity to take personal initiative to mend fences. Disliked in Delhi and mistrusted in Beijing, Oli nonetheless will have his task cut out maintaining an increasingly difficult balance between the two neighbours.The priority for the new Oli government, just like it was for its predecessors, will be to breathe some life into a stagnant economy. A message of political stability given through a two-thirds majority will help. Yet both in and outside the country, there is a justified suspicion over the longevity of this ‘unnatural’ Congress-Communist coalition. Oli as prime minister must be ready to make some tough personal adjustments in order to stop the cycle of instability in government. This means not just reining in his natural tendency to rebuff critics and rely on a small coterie on all vital matters but reaching out to coalition partners and even the opposition parties as often as he can. In fact, if Oli tries to go it alone, before long this coalition too will implode. Whether while trying to revise the constitution, making important appointments, or crafting a budget, his government must be seen to be striving to engage the widest section of relevant stakeholders. The onus is on Oli to prove his critics wrong.  \nPresident Ramchandra Paudel on Tuesday authenticated three bills endorsed by both houses of the Federal Parliament.The bills authenticated by the President include the Finance Bill 2024, the Bill to Raise National Debt, 2024 and the Customs Tariff Bill, 2024. The Office of the President said in a statement that the President authenticated the bills in accordance with Article 113 (2) of the constitution. \nIndian Ambassador to Nepal Naveen Srivastava paid a courtesy call on Minister for Foreign Affairs Arzu Rana Deuba at her office at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Singha Durbar on Tuesday.The foreign ministry said in a post on X that various matters relating to Nepal-India relations and cooperation were discussed on the occasion.Rana assumed her office on Monday. While taking charge of the office, Rana said that boundary disputes should be resolved based on facts and evidence, avoiding unnecessary conflicts with neighbouring countries. \nPresident Paudel accepts Attorney General Pokharel's resignation following government change, per tradition; resignation sparked controversy over a letter regarding a cooperative fraud case.\nGareth Southgate resigned as England manager after losing 2-1 to Spain in the Euro 2024 final, ending his reign with an impressive knockout record but also two heartbreaking final defeats.\nIsraeli forces battled Hamas-led fighters in several areas across Gaza on Tuesday, while Palestinian health officials said at least 13 people were killed in Israeli bombardments in southern and central areas of the enclave.In Rafah, a southern border city where Israeli forces have been operating since May, five Palestinians were killed in an air strike on a house, while in nearby Khan Younis, a man, his wife and two children were killed, they said.In central Gaza in Nuseirat, one of the enclave’s eight historic refugee camps, at least four Palestinians were killed in separate shelling and aerial strikes, medics said. Israeli tanks bombed the southern sector of Gaza City earlier on Tuesday, residents said.The Israeli military said troops continued “intelligence-based” activities in Rafah, killing many Palestinian gunmen over the past 24 hours. It said air strikes had targeted militants, tunnels, and other Hamas military infrastructure.It added that the Israeli air force had struck around 40 targets across the enclave, including sniping and observation posts, military structures, and buildings rigged with explosives.The armed wings of Hamas and the Islamic Jihad said in separate statements their fighters attacked Israeli forces in several locations with anti-tank rockets and mortar fire.Israel has vowed to eradicate Hamas after its militants carried out the worst attack in Israel’s history on Oct. 7, killing 120 and taking more than 250 hostages, by Israeli tallies.In the nine-month war, more than 38,000 Palestinians have been killed in the enclave, according to Gaza’s health authority, which doesn’t distinguish between combatant and non-combatant casualties, although officials say most of the dead were civilian.Israel says it has lost 326 soldiers in Gaza and says at least a third of the Palestinian fatalities are fighters.Efforts mediated by Egypt and Qatar to end the conflict and release the hostages, as well as Palestinians in Israeli jails, had appeared to be making some progress, negotiators had said.TALKS PAUSEDHowever, the talks stalled on Saturday after three days of intense negotiations failed to produce a viable outcome, Egyptian security sources said, and after an Israeli strike targeting Hamas’ top military chief, Mohammed Deif. The attack in the Khan Younis area killed more than 90 people and wounded hundreds of others, health authorities in Gaza said.A Palestinian official close to the talks told Reuters on Tuesday that Hamas was keen not to be seen as halting the talks despite the stepped-up Israeli attacks.“Hamas wants the war to end, not at any price. It says it has shown the flexibility needed and is pushing the mediators to get Israel to reciprocate,” the official, who asked not to be named said.He said Hamas believes Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was trying to avoid a deal by adding more conditions that restrict the return of the displaced to northern Gaza and to maintain control over Rafah borders with Egypt, conditions that would not be acceptable to the group.US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said on Monday that two senior advisers to Netanyahu said Israel is still committed to reaching a ceasefire.Citing a report by the United Nations Environment Programme, the UN Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA said in a post on X it would take 15 years to clear around 40 million tons of war rubble in Gaza. The effort would need 100+ trucks and cost over $500 million. \nRwandans lined up on Monday to elect their next president, with early results putting incumbent Paul Kagame in the lead in a vote widely expected to give him a fourth term and extend his near quarter century in charge of the East African country.The two men standing against him - Frank Habineza from the Democratic Green Party and independent Philippe Mpayimana - said they were hoping to make some progress, but analysts and rights groups said Kagame’s overwhelming victory was all but certain.Kagame, who got more than 93% of the vote at the last three elections, won praise from Western and regional leaders at the time for helping end the 1994 genocide in Rwanda. The US State Department and others have also lauded the development of the economy.Rwandans are also voting on Monday for members of the lower house of parliament and provisional results are expected by July 20. Polling stations were open until 3 PM.The overall voter turnout was 98% of the 9 million registered voters, Oda Gasinzigwa, chair of the National Electoral Commission, said in a statement on the national broadcaster later on Monday evening.Of 78.94% of the votes counted at about 2017 GMT, Kagame was ahead with 99.15% of the votes, data from the commission showed.Campaign groups, including Human Rights Watch, have accused authorities of cracking down on journalists, the opposition and civil society groups before the vote. Kagame has dismissed such accusations and described himself as the stable candidate.His reelection could signal a measure of political stability for his corner of a fractured region, but also continued global scrutiny, given the accusations of abuses and of supporting rebels in neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo - a charge he has also denied.Earlier on Monday, at the Rwandexco polling centre in the capital Kigali, Barimukije Pheneas said he would vote for the 66-year-old incumbent.“We voted smoothly without any crowding, and we are happy,” Pheneas said.“I voted for Paul Kagame because he has achieved a lot for us; he united us.”Motorcycle taxi driver Karangwa Vedaste said the voting process was calm and peaceful, but declined to say who he had chosen.“I voted for a leader I trust. The one I voted for is a secret in my heart. We will share it when he wins,” Vedaste said.The electoral commission barred eight other candidates, including Kagame’s most vocal critics, from running, citing a range of reasons including missing and incomplete registration documents.Democratic Green Party candidate Habineza, whose deputy was found dead and almost beheaded in the run-up to the 2010 vote, said there had been signs of progress.“We toured the entire country, and wherever we went, people welcomed us warmly. They gave us gifts and assured us they would vote for us,” Habineza said after voting.“We have to maintain this momentum and not regress,” he added.“We are confident, each of us is confident, it’s half and half,” independent presidential candidate Mpayimana told journalists after casting his vote.The US State Department says on its website Rwanda has made “progress in developing national and local government institutions, economic development, maintaining security (and) promoting reconciliation”.It also says it backs Rwanda efforts to “increase democratic participation (and) enhance respect for civil and political rights”. \nScattered thunderstorms and heavy rainfall are expected in various regions of Nepal on Tuesday and tonight.\nEight years ago, in the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election, JD Vance was a bitter critic of Donald Trump.Publicly, he called the Republican presidential candidate an “idiot” and said he was “reprehensible.” Privately, he compared him to Adolf Hitler.But by the time the former president tapped Vance to be his running mate on Monday, the Ohio native had become one of Trump’s most ardent defenders, standing by his side even when other high-profile Republicans declined to do so.James David Vance’s transformation—from self-described “never Trumper” to stalwart loyalist—makes him a relatively unusual figure in Trump’s inner circle.Democrats and even some Republicans have questioned whether Vance, who wrote a bestselling memoir “Hillbilly Elegy” and is now a US senator from Ohio, is driven more by opportunism than ideology.But Trump, who survived an assassination attempt at a Pennsylvania campaign rally on Saturday, and many of his advisers see his transformation as genuine.They point out that Vance’s political beliefs—which mix isolationism with economic populism—dovetail with those of Trump, and put both men at odds with the old guard of the Republican Party, where foreign policy hawks and free market evangelists still hold sway.Republican Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, whom Vance has described as a mentor, told Reuters that Vance shifted his views on Trump because “he saw the successes that President Trump as president brought to the country.”In particular, Vance’s vocal opposition to US aid for Ukraine in its war with Russia has delighted Trump’s most conservative allies, even as it has upset some Senate colleagues.“He understands what Trump is running on and, unlike the rest of the Republican Party in Washington, agrees with it,” conservative commentator Tucker Carlson, a vocal Vance supporter, told Reuters.Vance, 39, was born into an impoverished home in southern Ohio. His pick may help boost the Trump campaign’s Rust Belt bona fides in a race that will be determined by voters in a handful of battleground states, including nearby Pennsylvania and Michigan, though his conservative views may be a turn-off for moderate voters.“To the extent that he can do anything for the ticket, it would be to recapture being the voice of the American dream,” said David Niven, an associate professor of politics at the University of Cincinnati who has worked as a speechwriter for two Democratic governors, referring to Vance’s rise from poverty to US senator and vice presidential candidate.After serving in the Marine Corps, attending Yale Law School and working as a venture capitalist in San Francisco, Vance rose to national prominence thanks to his 2016 book “Hillbilly Elegy.” In that memoir, he explored the socioeconomic problems confronting his hometown and attempted to explain Trump’s popularity among impoverished white Americans to readers.He was harshly critical of Trump, both publicly and privately, in 2016 and during the opening stages of his 2017-2021 term.“I go back and forth between thinking Trump is a cynical asshole like Nixon who wouldn’t be that bad (and might even prove useful) or that he’s America’s Hitler,” he wrote privately to an associate on Facebook in 2016.When his Hitler comment was first reported, in 2022, a spokesperson did not dispute it, but said it no longer represented Vance’s views.By the time Vance ran for Senate in 2022, his demonstrations of loyalty—which included downplaying the January 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol by Trump’s supporters—were sufficient to score the former president’s coveted endorsement. Trump’s support helped put him over the top in a competitive primary.In media interviews, Vance has said there was no “Eureka” moment that changed his views on Trump. Rather, he gradually realised that his opposition to the former president was rooted in style rather than substance.For instance, he agreed with Trump’s contentions that free trade had hollowed out middle America by crushing domestic manufacturing and that the nation’s leaders were too quick to get involved in foreign wars.“I allowed myself to focus so much on the stylistic element of Trump that I completely ignored the way in which he substantively was offering something very different on foreign policy, on trade, on immigration,” Vance told the New York Times in June.In the same interview, Vance said that he met Trump in 2021 and that the two grew closer during his Senate campaign.Vance declined to be interviewed by Reuters for this article and his spokesperson declined to comment for it.The Ohio senator’s detractors see his shift in views as a cynical ploy to ascend the ranks of Republican politics.“What you see is some really profound opportunism,” said Niven, the politics professor.One issue where his position appears to have converged with Trump is abortion.Vance implied in a 2021 interview that victims of rape and incest should be required to carry pregnancies to term, and in November he described a vote by Ohioans to add the right to abortion care to the state’s constitution as a “gut punch.”This year, he said he supports access to the abortion pill mifepristone, a view that Trump shares. \nPrime Minister KP Oli has instructed his ministers to set deadlines for their work and bring about visible changes within a month.Addressing the first Cabinet meeting on Monday after taking oath of office and secrecy from President Ramchandra Paudel, Oli urged his cabinet colleagues to work with urgency.Along with Oli, other 21 cabinet ministers also took oath of office and secrecy on Monday at a function at the President Office.“The prime minister clearly instructed us to achieve visible change and show concrete results within one month,” said Prithvi Subba Gurung, Minister for Communication and Information.The Cabinet meeting also appointed Minister Gurung as government spokesperson. But the government has decided to make public the Cabinet decisions only after 24 hours.Besides urging his Cabinet colleagues to demonstrate results within a month, the prime minister stressed the need for the government to instill hope within six months that the government is doing a good job. The prime minister also called for visible improvements across all indicators within one year, while urging ministers to enhance coordination.Gurung announced the government’s new policy of not releasing Cabinet decisions immediately. Earlier, decisions were made public soon after each Cabinet meeting.Successive governments have adopted different approaches about releasing Cabinet decisions.“Cabinet decisions will be kept confidential for 24 hours. Since we have set the rule, neither the prime minister, nor ministers can disclose them before that. Why should we immediately publicise what we are doing? It is your responsibility to learn about it after 24 hours. If we release information prematurely, that will go against our policy of confidentiality,” said Gurung after the Cabinet meeting.“If anything requires to be made public immediately, it will be announced after the Cabinet’s decision,” said Gurung.The meeting also decided to upgrade the Kirtipur-based cricket ground to a stadium, Prime Minister Oli announced on his Facebook account, adding that the construction would be completed within 300 days.The new stadium in Kirtipur will feature state-of-art amenities such as parapets for spectators, floodlights for night games, among other things and will be completed within the 300 days, Oli wrote on Facebook. Despite cricket’s growing popularity in Nepal, inadequate infrastructure has affected both players’ confidence and spectators’ enjoyment of the game. Similarly, the Cabinet also decided to compensate family members if a member goes missing and remains unlocated for ten days, with an equal amount provided for a deceased person.Minister Gurung clarified that this compensation applies mainly to people missing in landslides, floods and other natural calamities where bodies are not found within ten days. And the compensation for those injured in such disasters will be different.“This is a new decision,” said Gurung. “But in the previous guidelines, those who go missing in natural calamities were not compensated.” The meeting also entrusted Liladevi Gadtaula as acting chief secretary until a new chief secretary is appointed. This is for the first time that the government has appointed a woman as acting chief secretary. \nImports from China to Nepal rose more sharply than expected in the first eleven months of the current fiscal year ending mid-June, while imports from India continued to tumble.According to the Trade and Export Promotion Center, the national trade promotion body, Nepal’s imports from China increased by 34.8 percent in the review period. In comparison, imports from India fell by 3.1 percent.Experts attributed ballooning imports from China to a sharp rise in the entry of electric vehicles (EVs). Likewise, a fall in imports from India has been attributed to the export curbs on food by the southern neighbour. In terms of value, imports from China increased by Rs70.44 billion to Rs272.81 billion in the review period.Import from India, however, dropped by Rs29.53 billion to Rs908.30 billion in the period.Due to the drop in imports from India, Nepal’s total imports declined 1.8 percent to Rs1.45 trillion in the first eleven months of the current fiscal year, which ended mid-June 2024.An official of the National Statistics Office says for a consumption-driven economy, falling imports are a worrisome sign. This suggests people are spending less on services and consumption while exports are stagnant.Rabindra Duwadi, the spokesperson at the Trade and Export Promotion Center, said imports from the north were driven by a massive influx of EVs, smartphones, and readymade garments.Besides, exports of iron, chemical fertiliser, apples and readymade garments too rose significantly. Traders said that China fulfils 80 percent of Nepal's readymade garment needs. The country imported readymade garments worth Rs33.67 billion in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year.In the same vein, Nepal imported 7,931 EVs worth Rs21.83 billion from China in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, up from 1,269 EVs worth Rs3.75 billion in the same period last fiscal year.Similarly, the country imported 1.23 million units of smartphones worth Rs17.27 billion from China in the review period. During the time, Nepal imported 99,965 tonnes of chemical fertiliser worth Rs8.69 billion from China.In the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, the country imported 65,827 tonnes of apples worth Rs6.98 billion from China, compared to 50,153 tonnes worth Rs4.73 billion in the same period last fiscal year.Duwadi said India’s share of Nepal’s total imports is 65.5 percent, while China contributes 18.8 percent. Traders say Nepal’s trade with India is vast, but it is steadily shifting to China. “One key reason for import growth from China is EVs,” said Rajan Sharma, a trade expert. “Chinese EVs are comparatively cheaper and perform better compared to Indian ones.” According to market observers, that’s why there has been an abrupt switch from India’s Tata Nexon EV to Chinese BYD.Sharma said readymade garments imported from China are cheaper compared to Indian readymade garments, including branded ones, which makes them popular among Nepali customers. “At the same time, India-made branded clothing items are expensive.”The Chinese Shein clothing brand has quickly gained popularity in Nepal due to its trendy clothes and reasonable prices.Trade experts say that due to the open border, there has been a massive rise in informal trade from India in recent years. Smuggling has thrived after India imposed a ban on foods.According to a research report titled, ‘Dynamics of informal cross-border trade in agricultural products between Nepal and India,’ prepared by South Asia Watch on Trade, Economics and Environment, only 40 percent of rice is imported from India through formal channels.India’s share in Nepal’s imports in formal trade is 60 percent, but the share of informal trade is likely to be higher.The research has pointed out that informal trade has thrived after the imposition of a 9 percent agriculture reform fee and a 2.5 percent advanced income tax, resulting in a total duty of 11.5 percent on rice imports.The paper said that India’s ban on rice and other agricultural exports has led to massive smuggling of food through the 1,800 km porous border between Nepal and India.Nepal is dependent on onions imported from India. When the Indian government imposed a ban on onion exports from December 2023 to May 2024, the product was readily available in the vegetable market and grocery stores, which indicated that a massive quantity of onions came through informal trade channels.The government did not take a single step to control the illegal trade or negotiate with the Indian government to ease the repeated bans on export of various agricultural goods. Nepal has thus lost out on huge import revenue as goods are coming to Nepal through illegal channels and are easily available in the market.Paras Kharel, executive director of the South Asia Watch on Trade, Economics and Environment, said overall imports have not been able to rebound in two fiscal years, reflecting the country’s economic slowdown. However, the rise in EV imports contributed to the sudden rise in imports from China.“Imports from Tatopani and Rasuwa customs rose by twice as much,” Kharel said. This shows that imports from China, which were halted after the Covid pandemic, are not gradually improving but are ballooning.According to the Department of Customs, the worth of imports from Tatopani customs increased to Rs37.16 billion in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, compared to Rs11.79 billion in the same period last fiscal year.Similarly, the worth of imports from Rasuwa customs on the northern border increased to Rs55.45 billion in the review period, up from Rs27.25 billion in the same period last fiscal year. \nThe National Human Rights Commission has said that the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act must include war crimes and crimes against humanity as serious violations of human rights while also ensuring justice to former Maoist child soldiers.The constitutional human rights watchdog made its position public as the three major parties worked to finalise the amendment bill to the Act under consideration in a parliamentary committee. Neither the existing Act nor the amendment bill includes war crimes, crimes against humanity and the issues of child combatants. In its report “The National Human Rights Commission and Transitional Justice”, the commission has said that together with murder, enforced disappearance, abduction or disappearances after the kidnapping, torture, rape or other sexual violence, war crimes and crimes against humanity should also be classified as non-amnestiable crimes.The 150-page report the commission is set to unveil on Monday includes its position on the long-pending transitional justice process while also documenting the efforts it made to deliver justice to the war-era victims of human rights violations. Since its establishment in 2002, the commission has investigated 1,073 cases related to the 1996-2006 insurgency and recommended actions against 222 including former Home Secretary and chief of Nepal Police.Following successive governments’ reluctance to follow its recommendations, the commission made public the list of perpetrators in October 2020 and January 2024.The leaders in negotiation are still struggling to finalise whether to list murder as a serious violation of human rights. Despite long negotiations, they have yet to sort out issues of minor Maoist soldiers and sentence reduction. They are also divided on whether victims who refuse to reconcile should be allowed to take their cases to court.The commission’s report says killing any unarmed individual, regardless of their involvement in the conflict, or those not directly involved in the fight, is a serious violation of human rights. There cannot be amnesty for serious violations of human rights, including war crimes and crimes against humanity. Amnesty for other human rights violations is possible only with the written consent of the victims, according to the commission.“Those who refuse pardon should be allowed to seek legal remedy as per the existing laws,” reads the report. “The truth and Reconciliation Commission must delve into the cases of the victims who lost their lives or got injured in landmines planted during the insurgency even after the peace process began.” Issues of child Maoist combatants must be addressed through the law to ensure they get justice, according to the commission.The use of minors in armed conflict is a war crime as per international law. The ruling Maoist Centre, therefore, does not want to include this issue in the law.During the verification process for army integration conducted by UNMIN in 2007, thousands of Maoist fighters had been disqualified for being minors. Among the 4,008 combatants who did not qualify for integration, 2,973 were verified as minors, while the remaining 1,035 had joined the Maoist ‘People’s Liberation Army’ after the first ceasefire of May 26, 2006—six months before the signing of the peace deal. The government had provided between Rs500,000 and Rs800,000 each to the combatants who chose voluntary retirement. However, those who were disqualified didn’t get any substantial support, except for a few thousand rupees from the United Nations.A group of former child soldiers led by Lenin Bista have filed a writ petition at the Supreme Court demanding the prosecution of the then Maoist supreme commander Pushpa Kamal Dahal, now the country’s prime minister, and the then ‘people’s government’ chief Baburam Bhattarai, who also is a former prime minister. The final hearing for the petition has been slated for September.Unlike in other issues, the commission has stood with the political parties on reduced sentencing. “The jail term of convicts who meet the criteria [perpetrators cooperating in the investigation process], can be reduced to a minimum of 25 percent as per existing laws,” reads the report. “The criteria for reduced sentencing can be defined in the law.” Surya Dhungel, a commissioner, said their position is based on international practice where reduced sentencing is common in transitional justice process.The commission has also reiterated that it will send its representative to the panel formed to recommend office bearers in the two transitional justice mechanisms only if there is a commitment from the parties concerned to amend the Act. “We are firm in our decision. Commitment from top political leadership is a must for the commission to send its representative to the recommendation committee,” said Dhungel. \nIn the early 1980s, Nepal’s firebrand communist leader, Mohan Bikram Singh, split from his comrade Nirmal Lama to establish a radical political alternative. Lama and Singh had earlier revolted from the Communist Party of Nepal to establish their own faction after the party’s fourth convention in 1974. Among Singh’s trusted leaders were Mohan Baidya, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, CP Gajurel and Dev Gurung. But Singh was forced to spend most of the following years politically exiled in India. As a result, Baidya effectively captured the party, renaming it the Communist Party of Nepal (CPN), “Mashal,” pronounced slightly different from Lama’s CPN “Masal.” However, Baidya and many senior party leaders faced self-imposed demotion after the party suffered a strategic setback in the now infamous ‘Sector Scandal’. Baidya was forced to nominate Dahal as the party leader in 1989, a position Dahal has held for three and a half decades.During the first two decades of his leadership, Dahal reigned supreme, as his party led the country into a decade-long violent political conflict that claimed, by some estimates, over 16,000 lives. Despite substantial economic and political costs, the conflict accelerated Nepal’s transition from a semi-feudal society with an exclusive political system into a more inclusive and secular republic. To that end, the Dahal-led Maoist party received due recognition through a popular mandate of the 2008 first Constituent Assembly elections. But Dahal’s unnecessary distrust of Nepal’s more established political parties, which had played a considerable role in bringing his party back into the political mainstream, made him commit blunders and unseated him from a comfortable majority government. His suspicion against fellow comrades who questioned his leadership style and decisions led to multiple splintering of the Maoist party. An insecure leaderDespite leading the country in and out of a transformative political conflict and becoming one of the key signatories of the new constitution, Dahal has remained an insecure leader who takes every opportunity to remind the Nepali people and the world about his “revolutionary contributions”. Possibly, this deep-seated insecurity emerges from the fact that he is neither seen as an intellectually gifted politician like his fellow comrade Baburam Bhattarai, who is known as an ideologue of the Maoist conflict or as a leader with integrity and simplicity like that of his political gurus Singh and Baidya. The thought of losing the political legacy of the ‘People’s War’ despite clinging onto the leadership of the party must constantly haunt the Maoist supremo.Dahal’s insecurity and political hypocrisy were also palpable in the way he derided the Madhesh Movement, which also raised the agendas of federalism and inclusion. Instead of considering them allies, Dahal ordered his party cadres to attack the Madheshi party leaders and their cadres. A large part of the political onus of escalating the tensions leading to the unfortunate Gaur massacre in 2007 will always rest on Dahal. Over the past decade and a half, Dahal has repeatedly failed to display the leadership he is ironically fond of discussing. Despite mobilising thousands of Tharu youths during the conflict, he failed to support their genuine claims on provincial boundaries during the federal structuring. And despite claims of his ‘one-sided love’ for Madhesh, he remained silent as more than 50 Madhesi protesters were indiscriminately killed by the security forces in 2015. Unreliable coalition partnerThere was a time when Dahal led a party that had shaken the country’s political core. Less than two decades later, he now leads a party that has mostly eroded its political base and only relies on a stronger coalition partner to remain relevant. But has Dahal even proved to be a reliable coalition partner? Let’s take a closer look. After Baidya split the party in 2012, the CPN-Maoist was reduced to the third position in the second Constituent Assembly elections, a significant loss from its commanding majority in the first CA. In the following two years, Dahal’s party was not only kept out of power but also forced to endorse a constitution that the Nepali Congress and rival communist party CPN-UML tabled. Having lost the capacity to dictate the political course, Dahal resorted to coalition politics. When the opportunity came, he supported UML’s Khadga Prasad Oli to cobble up a coalition government in October 2015. However, when the Nepali Congress offered him to lead a new coalition, he abandoned Oli and became Prime Minister in 2016. With the 2017 elections on the horizon, Dahal knew his party would not be able to compete with the larger parties that had successfully led the constitution drafting. With some active external mediation, Dahal persuaded Oli for an electoral alliance and even agreed to an eventual unification of the communist forces. When the left unity won a landslide victory, Dahal was convinced that Oli would honour the agreement to hand over power to him mid-way through the four-year period. When Oli refused, he split the united CPN in 2020, convincing several disgruntled leaders like Madhav Nepal to abandon the party and join a coalition with the Nepali Congress. The new coalition also offered Dahal and his party a comfortable division of electoral seats in the 2022 local, provincial and federal elections. But soon after the elections were over, Dahal bargained for power with both Deuba and Oli. Despite having won only 32 seats in the federal parliament with only 11 percent popular vote, Dahal managed to become Nepal’s 33rd Prime Minister in December 2022.Impending downfallIn 2014, political analyst CK Lal had told me that Dahal’s political opportunism would make him relevant in Nepali politics for at least another decade. The Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML took exactly a decade to realise that Dahal had been cashing in on Nepal’s fractured politics. This week, the two parties agreed that Nepal’s long-term political stability requires an introspection into the present electoral system, which allows electorally less popular outfits to dictate the course of national politics. So, not only have the two large parties decided to pull the plug on the Dahal government, but they also agreed to form an independent commission to study and propose amendments to the current electoral provision.While there is little disagreement that the current electoral system paved the way for more representation of the hitherto marginalised sections, the opportunity to correct inefficacies like expensive election campaigning and manipulation of the proportional candidacy lists by the parties must not be dismissed either. There are also serious doubts about the intention of the two parties to strike a deal at a time when the Nepal Police and the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority are investigating some high-profile corruption cases. It is up to the two parties to vindicate their intent by ensuring that the new political course does not interfere in these investigations. And even if the two parties agree to amend the constitutional provisions regarding elections, they will need to gather a national consensus or at least a two-thirds majority. Whatever happens in the next few weeks and months, it is evidently clear Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s eventual political downfall is on the horizon. \nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that Nepal’s economy, still reeling from subdued domestic demand and post‑pandemic balance sheet repairs, may face an increasingly gloomy and uncertain outlook, mainly due to fragile political stability and cooperatives failure.The global lender, which provides policy advice and financing to its members to foster growth and financial stability, said Nepal’s fragile political stability could disrupt policy continuity and reform implementation. Nepal is set to elect the new prime minister next week. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is almost certain to fail the trust vote. This will be his fifth trust vote in a year and a half. The CPN-UML withdrew its support to the government on July 3 after it ditched its coalition with the CPN (Maoist Centre) and joined hands with the Nepali Congress to form a new government.This is the fourth time in Nepal’s political history that two major parties are forming a government without a powerful opposition, which observers say weakens democracy's effective functioning.On Tuesday, the IMF completed the fourth review under its four‑year extended credit facility, allowing Nepal to withdraw $41.3 million to help the country's economic recovery.This brings total disbursements under the extended credit facility for budget support to $247.7 million.The IMF executive board approved the extended credit facility arrangement for Nepal on January 12, 2022. The approved amount totals $371.6 million, which is 180 percent of Nepal’s special drawing rights quota (SDR) of 282.42 million.“Nepal’s economy continues to face challenges,” said the statement issued by the IMF on Thursday. It said that Nepal’s growth projected at 3 percent in the fiscal year 2023-24 remains below potential due to subdued domestic demand and post‑pandemic balance sheet repairs. The IMF has talked about Nepal’s cooperatives sector for the first time.In the statement, the IMF warned about the intensification of financial sector vulnerabilities, such as a further rise in non-performing loans. In this context, “more failures of cooperative lenders could endanger the banking system's soundness,” the IMF said.According to experts and bankers interviewed by the Post, cooperatives, which the government once embraced as one of the three pillars of the economy, are now threatening the economy.In Nepal, millions of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are heavily involved in cooperatives, and their failure could not only damage the fragile economy, but also harm social harmony, say experts. Cooperatives are involved in sectors ranging from dairy and livestock to tailoring and retail.Recently, thousands of victims of cooperatives fraud have staged protests in various parts of the country, demanding the return of deposits embezzled by cooperative operators. Hundreds of such depositors came to Kathmandu and staged protests. The government recently signed an agreement with them, promising to solve their problems as soon as possible.“The problem in the cooperative sector will shake up the banking sector. But if there is a wise move, the banking sector can absorb the shock,” said Upendra Poudyal, president of the Confederation of Banks and Financial Institutions Nepal. He said that the regulation of cooperatives has already been delayed. “We have seen that cooperatives are being operated for personal gains. A limited number of people took the benefit.” “Now, the central bank should begin with a single threshold. Limit the number and start supervision.” As of mid-March, there are 31,450 cooperatives in Nepal, with 7.38 million members. The deposit mobilisation in cooperatives amounted to Rs478 billion, while credit mobilisation stood at Rs405 billion. They currently employ 94,000 people.In a recent interview, Kashi Raj Dahal, immediate past chairman of the Crisis-ridden Cooperatives Management Committee, a government agency, told the Post that globally, most cooperatives work in productive sectors like food production, dairy, fruits and other agricultural activities. “But in Nepal, around 25,000 cooperatives are involved only in financial activities, mainly collecting deposits and issuing loans. Such cooperatives are now in crisis. Over 15,000 are registered to collect deposits. Even others registered as multi-purpose cooperatives primarily engage in savings and credits. Around 500 cooperatives are currently in trouble.”The Dahal-led government has promised the return of at least Rs500,000 to each depositor by recovering it from the directors' assets. Yet doubts persist about whether depositors will get back their money. Some economists have warned about potential mass protests if the cooperatives issue is not taken seriously.The IMF has also warned that the failure to raise the execution rate of large-scale projects would deprive the economy of much-needed stimulus and weigh on growth. On the pessimistic side, the IMF said that economic activity is expected to increase, reaching 4.9 percent in 2024-25, supported by more robust domestic demand. The statement reads that the cautiously accommodative monetary policy stance, the planned increase in capital expenditures in the 2024-25 budget, additional hydropower generation, and a continued rise in tourist arrivals are expected to boost domestic demand and growth. Inflation is expected to remain within the Nepal Rastra Bank’s (NRB) target ceiling of 5.5 percent.“Nepal has made important strides on its economic reform agenda. Decisive actions in monetary policy, bank regulation and rolling off Covid support policies played a major role in overcoming urgent balance of payments pressure in 2021-22,” said Bo Li, deputy managing director of IMF. “Reserves continue to rise without the need to use distortive import restrictions. Despite revenue shortfalls, fiscal discipline was maintained in 2022-23 and 2023-24. Bank supervision and regulation have improved by rolling out new supervisory information systems. Nepal’s medium-term outlook remains favourable as strategic investments in infrastructure, especially in the energy sector, are expected to support potential growth.”The IMF said that strengthening public investment management would support the needed boost to capital spending. Enhancing fiscal transparency will help contain fiscal risks and strengthen medium-term fiscal sustainability.“As monetary policy transmission is still weak in a context of balance sheet repair, a cautious and data-dependent monetary policy remains appropriate to preserve price and external stability,” the IMF said.  \nPyakuryal holds a Phd in Public Affairs from the University of Akron, US. In this interview, they discuss Nepal’s elusive political stability, the narratives governing Nepali politics, the role of patriarchy, and the trends in Nepali politics Pyakuryal will be closely following in the years ahead. \n\n\nSri Lanka’s rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences make it one of the world’s best holiday destinations. The most common sight across the island nation is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure—a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use. Despite being cash-strapped and plunging into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back, thanks to the growing number of tourists. We spent five days in the island country two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory.

The situation had been more difficult due to India’s blockade. A few months into Oli’s tenure, the southern neighbour withdrew its blockade while the constitution was amended to address the concerns of the agitating communities. Though the Madhesh-based parties boycotted voting on the constitution amendment, it had partially addressed the concerns of the dissenting groups. His government also signed a historic Trade and Transit Agreement with China, ending Nepal’s sole dependence on India for third-country trade.Oli’s nationalist graph as prime minister for 10 months between October 2015 to August 2016 went up so high that his CPN-UML not only emerged the largest party from the 2017 election but was very close to the majority mark on its own. When Oli moved into Baluwatar for the second time in February 2018, he had an even stronger electoral mandate. After a merger with the CPN (Maoist Centre) two months later, the Nepal Communist Party that he jointly led with Pushpa Kamal Dahal enjoyed a near two-thirds majority in the House of Representatives. Oli’s prime ministership started with high hopes and excitement as he was leading a majority government for the first time in around two decades. As Oli was set to lead the government for a full five-year term, the hope was that decades of political instability would end, the constitution would be implemented and the federal system strengthened. The expectations, however, were short-lived. Oli started demonstrating his authoritarian streak right after taking charge as the executive head. He brought the National Intelligence Department, the Department of Revenue Investigation and the Department of Money Laundering under the purview of the Prime Minister’s Office.His intolerance for dissent became apparent when he banned protests at Maitighar, near Singha Durbar, the government’s seat. His government then prepared a slew of bills aiming to muzzle the media, curtail freedom of expression and shrink civic space. He had contested the elections by selling big dreams—railway connecting China, Nepal’s own ship in the high seas, and distribution of gas through pipelines, among other things. But none of these dreams even came close to fruition. Having realised he had failed to deliver as promised even two years after coming to power, he played another nationalist card—amending the constitution to show Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura in Nepal’s map—which his predecessors never dared to do. While it has been registered as a historic move in the country, it antagonised New Delhi.Oli’s unilateral style of running government and leading the party forced Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Madhav Kumar Nepal to ally against him, leading to a split in the Nepal Communist Party. After failing to keep the NCP united, Oli tried to dissolve the House—twice in under six months.His decision to trample on the constitution to stay in led to his humiliating exit from the government. He was ousted by the Supreme Court. Political analysts say Oli has a historic opportunity to right the previous wrongs. “The Congress-UML alliance has generated high hopes and provides an opportunity for Oli to correct his past mistakes,” Uddhab Pyakurel, who teaches political sociology at Kathmandu University, told the Post. “However, Oli’s recent statements [on House dissolution] show he is still not in the mood for course correction. He has no regrets about his wrongdoings.”Oli has repeatedly defended his move to dissolve the House even until last month. The Congress-UML alliance stands on the foundation for stability. But how can the person who couldn’t give stability even when he commanded a majority government ensure stable government now, says Pyakurel. “Trust in the new government will be low as the parties have kept secret even the agreement that led to its formation,” he says.However, some analysts say it would not be easy for the incumbent not to deliver. “There is a strong voice within both the Congress and the UML that it is futile to form a government that cannot deliver. So the pressure to perform will come from both the ruling alliance as well as the opposition,” says Sanjeev Humagain, who teaches PhD students in politics and international relations at Tribhuvan University.“The Congress-UML coalition has the political capital needed to deliver. The bureaucracy too will find it difficult not to cooperate with the government of two major forces. I see a positive environment for delivery.” \nOn July 1, the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML reached a deal to form the government with KP Sharma Oli, the UML chairperson, taking the prime ministerial seat first. That would be possible in a coalition formed as per Article 76 (2) of the Constitution of Nepal.While the Congress and the UML were confident that Article 76 (2) would be invoked as the President invited the parties to form the new government, outgoing Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s CPN (Maoist Centre) had been claiming that the government formation process should be shifted to Article 76 (3). Maoist leaders repeatedly claimed in and outside Parliament that as the Dahal government was formed as per Article 76 (2), his successor should be appointed under Article 76 (3).Article 76 (3) coming into play meant Oli would not become the prime minister this time, as the constitutional provision pertains to a minority government led by the largest party. Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, as the parliamentary party leader of the largest party in the House of Representatives, would become the prime minister. On July 3, the UML recalled its ministers while also withdrawing its support to the Dahal government. The prime minister was then left with two options: resign or face the House.Despite knowing that he would lose the confidence motion, Dahal opted for the vote. That was because he believed the President would initiate a new government formation process under Article 76 (3) after he lost the trust vote.Article 76 (3) says in cases where the prime minister of a coalition government fails to win the confidence of Parliament, the President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the largest party in the House as prime minister. “Our party believed that Article 76 (3) would be invoked after the prime minister lost the vote of trust. This is why he [Dahal] chose the vote of confidence instead of resigning,” an office bearer of the Maoist Centre told the Post. However, President Ramchandra Paudel, hours after Dahal lost the floor test on Friday evening, called two or more parties to stake a claim to the government as per Article 76 (2). Paudel had consulted some constitutional experts before making the call. All the experts except one had suggested that he go for a coalition government—rather than a minority one—citing the Supreme Court’s rulings. They were of the opinion that there is no constitutional barrier to calling for government formation under Article 76(2) as Dahal’s floor test was his fifth since taking office in December 2022 in the House elected that year.Article 76 (3) is automatically invoked when the prime minister appointed under Article 76 (2) fails the floor test in the first attempt. The last time he faced Parliament was on May 20 after the Upendra Yadav-led Janata Samajbadi Party, Nepal withdrew its support.The Maoist Centre is not happy with the President's decision. \"Yes, the President's call is not what we wanted. We believe it was a political move rather than legal,\" Hit Raj Pandey, the party's chief whip, told the Post. Asked if his party will challenge the move in court, Pandey said \"no\".However, the party’s office bearers said the Maoist Centre will not confront the President directly. Lawyers close to the party are most likely to file a writ petition in the court.\"There is every possibility that our legal wing will challenge the President’s move in the Supreme Court,\" he told the Post. Lawyers close to the party reiterate that Article 76 (3) is the only option for government formation after the prime minister loses the vote of confidence.Former attorney general Mukti Pradhan is one of those advocates close to the Maoist Centre who make such a claim. \nIn a bid to prevent garbage from piling up on streets during the monsoon, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City has deployed heavy equipment including bulldozers, excavators, and loaders, to clear the road to the landfill site. Officials said the move aims to ensure smooth transfer of waste as roads to the landfill often become impassable during the monsoon, preventing the passage of garbage trucks.“We have deployed three excavators, two bulldozers and two loaders to clear landslide debris along the road to the Bancharedanda landfill,” said Rabinman Shrestha, chief of the Environment Department at the metropolis. “Also, we have kept five more vehicles on standby for immediate deployment if needed.”Every year, during monsoon season, the road to landfill sites gets obstructed in multiple places, obstructing the transfer of house waste collected in the three districts of the capital city—Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur. Apart from these, some local levels of Kavrepalanchok also discard garbage at the landfill site at Bancharedanda.The metropolis officials said that they had purchased 10 high-pressure pumps to drain floodwaters from inundated settlements.“Five pumps have already been sent to the high-risk areas along riversides,” said Shrestha. “These can quickly pump away floodwaters.”The city office started repairing the Sisdole road leading to the Bancharedanda landfill in Nuwakot district just a few weeks before the start of the monsoon. Officials said Rs30 million had been allocated for repairs, which included fixing potholes, concreting roads, and other works.Around 200 metres of road near the Sisdole area, which is often damaged by garbage trucks and excavators, will be concretised, according to officials.Besides monsoon-induced road obstructions, garbage disposal is sometimes disrupted due to obstructions by the residents living in settlements near and around the landfill site. These obstructions cause weeks-long halt to door-to-door garbage collection, leading people in the Valley to discard their trash on streets.Officials said that a high-pressure pump is being used to prevent the overflow of leachate from the dumping ground.Landfill leachate is a hazardous liquid containing harmful bacteria, chemicals and other components. It forms when rainwater passes through a landfill or when organic matter decomposes naturally.Officials say the leachate needs to be re-injected into the landfill, which quickens the decomposition process of the landfill waste and prevents the liquid from flowing into the river. The City office has also started segregating degradable and bio-non-degradable waste materials from households in its seven wards. Wards 5, 7, 10, 12, 24 and 27 have been segregating the waste materials generated in the households. The city office has also arranged separate trucks for collecting segregated waste materials from the households.Degradable waste materials are being turned into compost at the KMC’s waste transfer station. Officials said that the metropolis has also been using reagents to expedite the compost-making process.The city office recently sold non-degradable waste worth Rs700,000.Waste segregation at the source was one of the measures Mayor Balendra Shah touted as a solution to Kathmandu’s chronic garbage problem. After he assumed office, Shah asked city residents to start segregating waste at the source. They started doing so, using separate bins in their homes. But the plan didn’t work, largely due to a lack of preparations on the KMC’s part.The Kathmandu Valley generates over 1,200 tonnes of solid waste every day, nearly 60 percent of which comes from the KMC alone. Experts say 60 percent of organic waste originating in the Valley can be converted into compost and the remaining 30 percent of non-degradable waste can be recycled. \nIn a bid to lessen the spread of the dengue virus during the ongoing monsoon season, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City has decided to continue the drive to destroy mosquito larvae and breeding grounds. Officials at the health department of the city office said on Friday that they have just completed a week-long drive in all 32 wards of the metropolis and plan to continue these efforts in the coming days as well.“Every Wednesday, our health volunteers will visit households and open spaces to destroy mosquito breeding grounds,” said Rishi Bhusal, epidemic prevention and control focal person at the metropolis. “Decisions on preventive measures including launching search and destroy drives will depend on the spread of virus and intensity of rainfall in the coming days.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vectors also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus, according to the World Health Organisation.According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,268 people from 72 districts have been infected with the dengue virus since January this year. Among the 72 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases: 141. Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and can be treated with paracetamol at home.Dengue symptoms include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes. Patients with these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and proper medical care can prevent death.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district. Since then, an increasing number of dengue infections have been reported from many districts, including major dengue outbreaks. Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Though the post-monsoon period is considered the dengue epidemic season, the deadly disease has already become endemic in Nepal, as outbreaks of the virus are reported every month, including in the winter months.Officials at the health department said that 654 health workers, including female community health volunteers, were deployed in the week-long campaign, which concluded on Friday.“Volunteers and health workers who were deployed to the door-to-door campaign checked the mosquito breeding grounds and the larvae, made people aware about the risks and destroyed the breeding grounds,” said Bhusal. Health workers reported that storage places for scrap materials, discarded cups, and plastic in open spaces, and unused lands as potential hotspots for the dengue virus in the coming days. Health workers have warned owners of these sites that action will be taken if mosquito larvae are found against the owner of the storage place if mosquito larvae were found.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects, such as plastic cups and bottles, could be breeding grounds for these mosquitoes.Public health experts say now is the right time to prepare for and prevent possible outbreaks. Health ministry officials said they have alerted all related agencies to the risk of a dengue outbreak. \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City has imparted mental health screening training to doctors and paramedics serving at urban health promotion centres.Officials at the Health Department in the metropolis hope that the move will help hundreds of patients with mental health issues in the city to get timely treatment.“Getting free treatment for mental health problems comes under the right to get free basic health care services,” said Sajina Maharjan, acting head of the department. “Mental health problem screening training to doctors and paramedics will help in the timely diagnosis of the problems and start of early treatment.”At least 32 doctors serving at the urban health promotion centres under the city office and dozens of paramedics participated in five-day screening training. The metropolis has upgraded its urban health clinics to urban health promotion centres and started providing services through medical doctors. “Due to the lack of doctors at our urban health promotion centres, patients suffering from mental health problems have been deprived of timely treatment,” said Nali Bajracharya, a senior public health officer at the department. “Now patients having mental health issues and seeking care at our health centres will also get mental health treatment.”Though neither the federal government agency nor the city office has data on the number of people suffering from mental health problems in the metropolis, doctors estimated that a lot of people could be suffering from various forms of mental health problems—anxiety, depression and others.Officials say that they are also planning to provide free medication to patients with mental health problems.Health workers say that many city dwellers, despite having mental health problems, do not seek treatment and instead turn to drugs and substances to cope. Due to the entrenched social stigma, fear of discrimination and other factors, many patients in Nepal do not talk about their mental health issues.The general tendency among people to conceal mental health issues due to the stigma attached to it has also forced patients to opt for substance abuse, doctors say.They say that while drugs and alcohol may provide temporary relief from stress, they are not a solution and can adversely affect mental health and well-being in the long run.“Treatment in the initial stage of mental illness helps patients achieve better results. For that, early diagnosis is crucial,” said Dr Pomawati Thapa, chief of the Non-communicable Disease and Mental Health Section at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Other local units should also follow the initiative to provide mental health screening training to health workers, including doctors.”Nepal is among the countries with highest rates of suicide, which is an extreme manifestation of a mental health problem.According to Nepal Police data, 6,993 people took their own lives in the fiscal year 2022-2023. This accounts for more than 19 deaths on average daily. Fifty-six percent of those who die by suicide are men.Doctors say that people do not attempt suicide for a single reason, but due to a complex situation arising from multiple problems.An increasing number of people are struggling with mental problems owing to the rising cost of living and the struggle to manage even their most basic needs, such as food, housing, healthcare and jobs, experts say.Whatever the cause, suicides and suicide attempts have a ripple effect, impacting families, friends, colleagues, communities and societies, doctors say.A study carried out by the Nepal Health Research Council in the past shows that about 13 percent of Nepalis suffer from some form of mental disorder. This means around one in eight Nepalis has mental health issues. Moreover, the country simply does not have enough experts to treat mental health problems, it added.Studies show the magnitude of suffering, the burden and costs for individuals, families and societies arising from mental health disorders are alarming in Nepal.“No doubt, mental health problems have been emerging as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in our country,” said Thapa. “All local governments must take initiative to address the problems. Only the federal government agencies cannot do much.”The World Health Organisation says that one in four people in the world has been affected by mental or neurological disorders at some point in their lives, and around 450 million people currently suffer from such conditions, placing mental disorders among the leading causes of ill health and disability worldwide. \nDuring the 2022 local level election, people of Kathmandu elected independent candidate Balendra Shah as their mayor for five years. Sunita Dangol of the CPN-UML secured the position of KMC deputy mayor in the same election. When they began their term, many suspected that the two—an independent mayor and his party-affiliated deputy—wouldn’t have cordial relations. But, in the last two years of their term, there has been no visible disagreement between them. They proved their sceptics wrong.Deputy Mayor Dangol kept mum when Mayor Shah accused her party chair, KP Sharma Oli, of policy corruption in the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate land scam.Moreover, Shah expressed his anger on June 3 over the government’s intervention in his plan to widen pavements in the New Road area. Deputy Prime Minister Raghubir Mahaseth of the UML leads the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, which maintains major roads.After the ministry intervened in the municipal plan to expand the sidewalk on New Road, Shah took to social media and wrote, “Honourable KP Oli jyu, don’t hoodwink people by engineering yet another scam to hide a scam of Rs10,000 crore [Rs100 billion].”He further added, “You have reassured those who had made advance payments to buy land of Giri Bandhu Tea Estate that they would get the land within two years.” “If one looks at the policy corruption in the tea estate, it appears not a single leaf would stir without Oli’s nod,” Shah wrote.A few days prior to the incident, Mayor Shah had engaged in a heated debate with Chinkaji Maharjan, a UML member and chairman of KMC’s ward 22, over the sidewalk expansion plan.Dangol remained quiet on the issue thus far. However, at the city council meeting on Monday, which also discussed KMC's policies and programmes for the fiscal year 2024-25, she criticised Mayor Shah for his remarks.“This should be the first time the deputy mayor opposed the public behavior and statement of the mayor,” a Kathmandu ward chairperson told the Post on the condition of anonymity.Dangol had her initial plan to contest the mayor position independently but the UML gave her the deputy mayor’s ticket.Speaking during the Monday discussion, Deputy Mayor Dangol said, addressing Mayor Shah, “Your and mine voices are being heard and watched by Nepalis worldwide. Therefore, those of us who want to come to politics should think about our expression,” Dangol remarked. “We should maintain the image and dignity of the institution we represent.”She also emphasised the need to accommodate the voices of everyone in an undertaking.Though the representatives of Kathmandu Metropolitan City claim that Dangol's Monday statement was unusual, they deny any rift between the two leaders of the local government. “City council’s is an internal meeting of the KMC where various issues arise. We settle those issues internally,” Nabin Manandhar, the KMC spokesperson and ward 17 chairman from the Nepali Congress, told the Post. “Having an opinion does not necessarily mean criticism.”Rajesh Kumar Shrestha, chair of KMC ward 19, seconded Manandhar.However, local representatives of Kathmandu have been questioning Shah for his ‘lone-wolf’ manner of leading the institution.“We should develop a working relationship that welcomes everyone’s spirit,” Dangol told the council meeting. “If one thinks they are in a position and everything should be done as they say, it will only lead to trouble.”She added, “While working in a team, we definitely have a different opinion, but different opinions should be respected.”At the meeting, referring to Mayor Shah's past statements, council member Anita Karki asked him, saying, “What if the voters of Kathmandu set ablaze the Durbar where the KMC office lies?”In September last year, when the traffic police obstructed a KMC vehicle, later known to be used by his postpartum wife, Mayor Shah provocatively wrote on Facebook, threatening to burn Singha Durbar, the federal government’s central secretariat.Traffic police, under the federal government, had stopped the vehicle to check necessary documents on a Saturday.After the incident, Shah wrote on social media warning that if the government blocked KMC's vehicles again, he would set fire to Singha Durbar.Dangol said on Monday that she believed it was wrong to write on social media or make a statement inciting people to burn the Singha Durbar or the Bagh Durbar, where the KMC office is situated.Dangol, speaking at the city council meeting, also said there should be no polarisation between the representatives who were elected to develop Kathmandu. \nA police officer was found dead on the premises of the federal parliament building in Baneshwar, Kathmandu on Wednesday.According to Ekram Giri, spokesperson for the federal parliament secretariat, Ajit Gole of Dolakha committed suicide by shooting himself.The body of the victim was recovered from the parliament building’s washroom.Dinesh Mainali, spokesperson for the Kathmandu Metro Police Range, said Gole, who was on duty from 6am to 10am, was found dead at around 8 in the morning. “A constable of Nepal Police was found dead inside a toilet of the parliament building,” Mainali told the Post. “Preliminary investigation shows he was inflicted with a gunshot.”Nepal police said the investigation is underway. \nGopi Man Shrestha and his family migrated to Chitwan from Lamjung in 1970. The pull factor was fertile land and irrigation facilities in the plains.The Shresthas purchased two bighas of land in Ameliya, Madi. Paddy yield was high due to the soil rich in nutrients and easy availability of irrigation. The family was also able to sell the grains after storing the year’s need for consumption. “I purchased two more bighas,” Shrestha said.Hundreds of families, particularly those in the hills, migrated to Chitwan in the 1970s and 1980s, in search of fertile lands. However, the situation is different now. Shrestha still owns land in Ameliya, but does not cultivate it. Locals are leaving the villages of Ameliya, adjoining the Chitwan National Park, Nepal’s first wildlife sanctuary. As the village gradually began emptying, paddy transplantation has also stopped.“Now, we buy rice to eat,” Shrestha said.Purnamaya Adhikari of Jiwanpur, Khaireni Municipality Ward 10, has been growing paddy on a bigha and a half. She has not switched to other crops but has seen banana plants grow on her neighbours' fields.“Many farmers have switched to banana. Paddy is least preferred,” Adhikari said.Chitwan has seen farmers switching to cash crops as the income from paddy is low.Statistics at the Agriculture Development Office, Chitwan show that paddy plantation area is shrinking fast.In the key season, the monsoon, farmers produce paddy on 22,000 hectares, down from 31,000 hectares two decades ago. The office record shows that paddy production peaked in 2002–03 when the Maoist insurgency compelled people to rush to the Tarai.Indra Dhungana, chief of the Project Implementation Unit, Bharatpur, under the Prime Minister Agriculture Modernisation Project, said there are no specific studies, but paddy cultivation in Chitwan is declining. “It’s because Chitwan has grown into a residential area, with land being plotted for housing.”The paddy fields in Chitwan have been filled with concrete houses in just 20 years. Besides, farmers have started searching for alternative sources of income. As commercial banana and vegetable farming and fisheries expand, paddy fields are vanishing, Dhungana said.Umraj Aryal, an official at the Agriculture Development Office, Chitwan, said the commercial vegetable farming trend is steady. “Nowadays, capsicum farming is growing in east Chitwan,” he said. “As the capsicum is sowed in early September, transplanting paddy [in the summer] is impossible.”Residential area has increased in Bharatpur wards 11 and 12. Around 20 years ago, those areas mostly remained filled with paddy, Aryal said. The Padampur area inside the national park, known for high paddy yield, has been shifted to Barandabhar forest south of the highway. In the new Padampur, banana and vegetable farming is thriving.Satya Narayan Chaudhary of Ratnanagar, Bichauli, does not believe that the paddy acreage has declined. “People have stopped farming.”As farmhands are not readily available, there has been a growing use of machines, he said.“Farmers are switching to other crops,” he said, admitting that land development for housing has increased. “It’s a serious issue.”According to statistics, vegetable farming and fisheries in Chitwan covered 2,132 hectares and 68 hectares during 1998-99.Vegetable farming has currently expanded to 6,503 hectares. However, since vegetable farming depends on the cropping cycle, it does not create a huge gap in the paddy production area, Chaudhary said.Paddy transplantation, however, cannot be done in fields used for commercial Banana farming and fisheries.Banana fields in Chitwan cover 2,200 hectares, while fish ponds have expanded to 800 hectares.“With the decline in paddy production, hay output has also fallen. Straw is a huge source of animal feed. Along with rice, Chitwan now imports straw too,” said Jhalak Nath Kandel, chief of the Agriculture Development Office.He said that the rice deficit in Nepal currently stands at 581,505 tonnes. “It’s a serious issue if paddy plantation areas decline. The country’s food import bill has ballooned.”Summer production has declined by a fourth, but there has been some growth in spring paddy areas and output. In the fiscal year 2002-23, spring paddy was transplanted on 3,750 hectares, which increased to 5,540 hectares in 2022-23. This fiscal year, spring paddy is growing on 7,000 hectares. “Demand for spring paddy is rising. A kind of cash crop, its farming is increasing,” said Nirmal Poudel, an agri economist at the Agriculture Development Office, Chitwan.Agriculture technicians say spring paddy is less prone to diseases. As it is produced in a season with little rainfall, it is largely unaffected by pests. This pushes the yield up. The summer paddy productivity stands at 4.4 tonnes per hectare while spring paddy output is 5.6 tonnes. According to Dhungana, farmers harvested 6.4 tonnes of spring paddy a hectare this spring.Due to farm mechanisation and improved irrigation, summer paddy also sees better harvest now. \nThe British Education Group, which owns The British College, Kathmandu, has now acquired the Maritime Business College (MBC), one of the oldest private institutes in Nova Scotia, Canada.Founded in 1899, MBC has a rich history of providing advanced career training. Over 125 years, the Halifax-based institution has built a strong reputation for educational excellence and adaptability in the evolving job market. The British Education Group said in a press statement that the local Ministry of Education also fully accredited the college as a Designated Learning Institution (DLI), making it one of the few private colleges in Canada authorised to recruit international students.They currently offer a diverse range of programmes, including Business Administration, Veterinary Assistance, Medical Device Reprocessing, Interior Decorating, and 2D-3D Animation and Digital Arts. As a result of this new partnership, the British Education Group plans to introduce additional courses offered at its London campus, Woolwich College. Rajen Kandel, Group CEO of the British Education Group, said, “We are committed to providing our students with global opportunities and experiences. This acquisition will facilitate seamless credit transfers between our Nepal, Dubai, and Canada campuses, further promoting our vision of creating global citizens.” The group owns several educational institutions in Nepal, Dubai, and London.  \nNepal recorded its historic high income from tourism in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, which ended mid-June, according to the latest data issued by Nepal Rastra Bank. Industry insiders attribute this to the appreciation of the US dollar.The central bank said that the country earned Rs76.55 billion from tourism in the review period, surpassing the record set in 2018-19 when the country had earned Rs75.37 billion from 1.2 million foreign tourists. (At that time, the exchange rate was $1=Rs112.9.)According to a central bank report, Nepal received 1.06 million tourists in the first 11 months.“The surge in tourism income is primarily a result of the exchange rate,” said Deepak Raj Joshi, former CEO of Nepal Tourism Board. Any adjustments in the exchange rate will prompt an appreciation or depreciation of the tourist’s currency, affecting transport costs and the tourist’s decisions to visit the country. “Thus, the exchange rate impacts the number of tourist visits and tourism receipts,” said Joshi.“Besides, the growth of international chain hotels and Nepal gradually switching to a digital payment system has also contributed to the growth in tourism income.”The tourism ministry’s statistics show that the average stay of tourists in Nepal is currently 13.2 days, while they spend $41 per day.Gunakar Bhatta, spokesperson for the Nepal Rastra Bank, said the depreciated exchange rate positively relates to the tourism demand, as travel becomes less expensive when visiting a devalued country. “The currency factor, normally, forces tourists to select a destination before a trip. In this context, a country with a depreciation in domestic currency will attract international tourists,” said Bhatta. He said that while most of Nepal’s economic indicators have been underperforming, tourism has been doing exceptionally well.While Nepal’s economy is anticipated to grow by 3.87 percent in the current fiscal year, accommodation and food service, which are linked to tourism activities, are expected to see a robust growth of 21.84 percent, the highest among all 18 economic compositions in the Nepali economy.“This shows how the tourism industry has been a boon for Nepal’s sluggish economic growth.”The digital payment system has also been making tourism income transparent. Paras Kunwar, chief operating officer of Fonepay, said Indian tourists have been spending Rs5 million a day since Nepal started the payment system through the quick response (QR) code on March 1.“Since the central bank has fully opened the digital retail payment gateway for Nepali operators with any other country, it will help bring more foreign currencies.”Through the budget, the government has announced that it will draw 1.6 million foreign visitors this year.According to industry insiders, the target is attainable, but there are a few challenges.From November 8, Kathmandu’s Tribhuvan International Airport will be closed for 10 hours daily, from 10 pm to 8 am, for five months until March 31, to expand the taxiways.September-November is Nepal’s peak tourist season.Besides, industry insiders say the Nepal Tourism Board has been headless for the past four months, affecting all international promotional and marketing events.A number of reports, including the latest by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), said Nepal’s economic activity is expected to pick up, with growth reaching 4.9 percent in the next fiscal year 2024-25. This growth will be supported by an increase in tourist arrivals, boosting domestic demand. According to the Nepal Tourism Board, the country’s tourism promotional body, in 2023, tourist arrivals crossed the million mark for the first time in four years.Foreign arrivals had crossed the one million mark for the first time in 2018 when the country received 1.17 million foreign visitors.The number reached 1.19 million in 2019. Then, the Covid pandemic started in early 2020, bringing arrivals to a standstill. Travel restrictions and an economic slowdown triggered by lockdowns delivered a massive blow to Nepal’s burgeoning tourism industry, decimating revenues and profits after 2020.Nepal received 230,085 and 150,962 tourists in 2020 and 2021, respectively. In 2022, the number shot up to 614,869.Joshi said that by the end of 2024, Nepal may get 1.2 million tourists in the year. “A careful execution of plan and proper marketing, especially in China, could boost arrivals to 1.6 million,” said Joshi. “It will be justified to shift Kathmandu’s airport expansion from November to December, to let the peak season pass.”Dozens of luxury hotels have opened across the country so there are no problems with accommodation, he said. Nepal has been widening roads and building other infrastructure, like airports, which will help attract more tourists. However, industry insiders say the government’s neglect of air safety problems could hinder future growth, particularly in the high-end segment, where travellers consider the safety of any destination country while making travel plans.Most embassies have put Nepal’s air safety situation on their travel advisories. The European Commission imposed this list in 2013 after Nepali airlines failed to meet international safety standards. The government has wilfully ignored the call of the United Nations aviation watchdog, the International Civil Aviation Organisation, to split Nepal’s civil aviation body into two entities: service provider and regulator. The separation is a crucial organisational reform agenda which has been a work in progress for the past one and a half decades. \nNepal’s central bank has allowed Nepali payment system operators to deal with digital retail payments in any country. For example, a Nepali payment system operator (PSO) can now agree with any PSO in any country to launch the quick response (QR) code payment system for the citizens of both countries to make purchases. Nepal Rastra Bank issued a circular on June 27, allowing a merchant-to-person payment (M2P) system. PSOs can now make agreements with PSOs of any country and start the service. However, before signing a memorandum of understanding, the PSOs need the central bank’s approval.“The central bank has fully opened the retail payment system. Nepali PSOs and PSOs of any country can now jointly start the retail payment service through QR code,” said Gunakar Bhatta, executive director of the Payment Systems Department at Nepal Rastra Bank.As the central bank has allowed merchant payment on the purchase of goods and services, the PSOs have started taking approval to start the service, Bhatta said. By coordinating on issues like bank settlement and dispute settlement, the licensed private sector PSOs can start the service.The central bank said that the withdrawal limit for a Nepali in a foreign country would be according to the existing foreign exchange rule, which is $2,500 per visit and $5,000 annually. There are 10 PSOs operating in the country as of mid-May.The QR code system in Nepal is relatively new.Starting March 1, Indians were allowed to make payments through their mobile phones. The development was hailed as a milestone in cross-border digital payment between Nepal and India, facilitating the students and people going to India for medical purposes.Nepal’s Fonepay, a PSO, has partnered with India’s NPCI International Payments to launch the cross-border payment service using quick response (QR) codes.With the central bank's provision, Fonepay has already started working, allowing Nepali nationals to make QR code payments in India.On June 1 last year, Fonepay signed a memorandum of understanding with Sri Lanka’s National Payment Network—LankaPay, to collaborate on a strategic partnership to revolutionise the digital payment landscape by developing an interoperable digital payment system that enables users to transact seamlessly across the two countries.However, in the lack of regulations, the QR code payment system did not start. “We have requested the approval for QR code payment service with Sri Lanka. We will soon start the facility,” said Paras Kunwar, chief operating officer (COO) of Fonepay. “Besides Sri Lanka, China is another market that we are looking at. We have started discussions with China UnionPay and Alipay+ to make cross-border QR code payments.”In May 2019, Nepal banned WeChat Pay and AliPay, stating that online payments through unregistered systems were illegal and resulted in a loss of income for Nepal. WeChat Pay, operating on Tencent’s messaging service, and e-commerce giant Alibaba’s Alipay are the two dominant platforms in mainland China.In June last year, Chinese digital payment service WeChat Pay and NMB Bank Nepal partnered to make the mobile payment system available in Nepal, allowing Chinese nationals visiting Nepal to pay for their purchases using their mobile sets.Kunwar said they would begin a QR code system in India from August. “For this, Nepali commercial banks are working on transaction limits and other issues.“We also need to adhere to many provisions including anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) before starting the cross-border payment services.”Kunwar said that the company is looking for other potential markets overseas where most Nepalis reside. For instance, South Korea is another prospective market for QR code payment.“We are looking into whether remittances can be sent through QR code if the central bank allows it. Nepal can be a potential market for tourists from South Korea and Japan and the service can allow them to withdraw money in Nepal.”Just like regional economic blocs, the payment service has also started making regional payment blocs. There is Asian Payment Network, a retail payment platform supported by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Kunwar said.“There are 17 members of the Asian Payment Network of ASEAN, including Sri Lanka from South Asia. Fonepay recently became a member of the Asian Payment Network, and with this, we can integrate the system with the 17 member countries.”The QR code system has become a boon for tourists, especially those from India.For instance, within three months of starting QR code payments to Indian citizens, Fonepay is handling around Rs5 million transactions daily. It has reduced the hassle of carrying cash. The Nepal government has banned all Indian notes above the denomination of 100.With the Fonepay service available in Muktinath and trekking areas connected to Pokhara, Indian tourists are increasingly withdrawing money while in these areas. According to a central bank report, QR code transactions sharply increased to Rs52.75 billion in mid-May from Rs45.67 billion in mid-April, after Nepal allowed Indian citizens to make payment via QR code in Nepal. The number of transactions also increased to 17.63 million from 16.10 million during the review period.QR code transactions increased to Rs53.88 billion from mid-May to mid-June, with a total of 19.82 million transactions. \nIn a bid to reduce patient deaths in hospital emergencies, the Ministry of Health and Population has started providing basic life support training to health workers.Officials hope that ongoing deaths in hospital emergencies would come down significantly once health workers were trained in basic life support.“Around 900 health workers, including medical doctors, nurses, paramedics, and health assistants, have already been trained with basic life support skills,” said Dr Prakash Budhathoky, spokesman for the ministry. “The remaining health workers will receive training in the new fiscal year.”Basic life support is a type of care that first responders, who could be health workers serving in hospital emergencies, provide to anyone suffering from cardiac arrest, respiratory distress and other life-threatening conditions.Experts say basic life support is very crucial in emergency situations—cardiac arrest, and trauma cases, among others. The procedure includes recognising and responding to emergency situations, seeking help, performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and providing breathing assistance.Chances of survival will be high if trained health workers respond to the cases first. Officials said that the number of patient deaths in emergencies could be reduced significantly if all health workers serving in hospital emergencies were trained with basic life support skills.“We will also encourage provincial governments to provide basic life support skills to health workers serving in provincial hospitals and health centres run by local units,” said Budhathoky. “Those serving in emergencies at private health facilities will also get this training.”Doctors say that basic life support skills can be effective in saving lives when provided promptly and correctly. Health officials say many health workers serving in emergencies of health facilities, especially those hired newly, do not have basic life support skills.Meanwhile, the Nepal Medical Council, the national regulatory body for medical doctors, said it is working to make continuous professional development training mandatory for licence renewal.“Doctors must pass a 100-mark test on ethics, basic life support, communication, infection control and the rational use of medicines,” said Dr Bishwa Raj Dawadi, the council member. “Gone are the days when one would remain a doctor simply by obtaining a medical degree. They must be updated with skills and new knowledge.”A few years ago, the Council made professional development training mandatory for all medical doctors. Failure to attend the course will result in non-renewal of the medical licence.Medical doctors undergo the training regularly, and the council assesses its effectiveness every five years to ensure that doctors providing health care services are updated in their profession.Professional training involves processes that act as refresher courses to update and enhance a doctor’s knowledge, skills, and experience, even after the completion of their formal degree. It can take the form of fellowships, seminars, workshops, conferences, and continuous medical education.The NMC said that CPD (continuous professional development training) is a lifelong process of learning and updating professional skills.Doctors also need to take effective communication skills training so that they can communicate with the families and relatives of patients about their condition and the treatment process, including surgeries. In recent years, there have been reports of scuffles between hospitals/doctors and the kin of patients in the event of a patient’s death. At times, situations have taken a nasty turn in which doctors have been manhandled and hospitals vandalised.The medical council said that implementation of the code of ethics has been a challenge thus far and that training such as the CPD could help in its effective enforcement. One of the problems the NMC is facing currently is its inability to prevent doctors and health institutions from advertising their skills and profession using mass media, which, according to the NMC, is against the code of ethics. \nIn a bid to support midwives and other healthcare personnel in ensuring safer births in low-resource settings, the Ministry of Health and Population has launched a “safe delivery app”.Officials hope that the mobile application will complement and enhance the ongoing capacity-building of health workers and help in reducing maternal and newborn deaths.“The Safe Delivery App provides up-to-date lifesaving procedures and practical guidance in the local language,” said Dr Bibek Kumar Lal, director of the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services, at the launch of the Nepali version of the Safe Delivery App. “It aims to improve the quality of emergency obstetric and newborn care, and the main users will be our frontline health workers, especially nurses and midwives.”Officials at the division said that the government has collaborated with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the Maternity Foundation (MF) to launch the Nepali version of the widely used digital health tool.Globally, every two minutes, a woman dies. In Nepal, two women die every day due to pregnancy-related complications—most of which are preventable, said Won Young Hong, a UNFPA representative in Nepal. “These are staggering numbers. UNFPA is pleased to work with the concerned stakeholders to localise this digital application so healthcare workers across Nepal can use it.”The Safe Delivery App is an evidence-based learning and training tool designed to support midwives, nurses, and other healthcare professionals to assist during births and to manage the most common complications. Among other features, it contains the latest clinical guidelines, animated instruction videos, descriptions of practical procedures, and action cards. It is free, and once downloaded on a smartphone or a tablet, it works offline, making it possible to be used even in the most remote areas. To date, more than 435,000 healthcare professionals across more than 70 countries have been reached through the Safe Delivery App and the accompanying programme worldwide, with Nepal being the latest country to introduce the App. “We will work with provincial governments and development partners to quickly roll out the App throughout Nepal,” said Lal.Nepal cut the maternal mortality rate from 539 per 100,000 births in 1996 to 239 per 100,000 births in 2016—for which the country even received a Millennium Award. According to the National Statistics Office report, the country has further reduced the number of deaths to 151 per 100,000 births in 2021. Maternal health experts, however, say that even if the country has made good progress in reducing maternal deaths, the current maternal mortality ratio is more than double the Sustainable Development Goals target, which is 70 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births by 2030.Neonatal deaths have not declined between 2016 and 2022, according to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022 carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population.The government’s target for the Sustainable Development Goals was to reduce neonatal mortality to 16 deaths per 1,000 live births by 2022 and 12 in every 1,000 live births by 2030.The SDGs, a follow-up on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), aim to end poverty, hunger, and all forms of inequality worldwide by 2030, and Nepal has committed to meeting the goals.The health ministry has been taking several measures to reduce maternal and neonatal deaths, including installing an underfloor heating system at birthing centres, setting up special newborn care units, training doctors, nurses, and paramedics in the district hospitals and distributing non-pneumatic anti-shock garments to prevent maternal deaths from excessive bleeding.Besides, the ministry provides free service and travel allowances for those opting for institutional delivery and antenatal visits. It also distributes misoprostol, a medication used to treat postpartum bleeding in new mothers, through female community health volunteers. \nAs heavy monsoon rains cause chaos across the country, dengue cases are surging in several districts, including Kathmandu.According to the Health Office Kathmandu, around 18 people are infected with the dengue virus every day. Officials, however, admit that this number could be just the tip of the iceberg, as the office gets reports only from 18 health facilities.“Yes, the number of people infected with the dengue virus could be several times higher than suggested by the reports we are getting every day,” said Dr Arjun Sapkota, chief of the Health Office, Kathmandu. “We are working to make daily reporting of dengue cases mandatory for private health facilities as well.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vectors also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus, according to the World Health Organisation.According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,432 people from 73 districts have been infected with the virus since January this year. Among the 73 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases with 159, followed by Jhapa with 120, Chitwan 83, Makawanpur 65, Tanahun and Doti 49 cases each, and Okhaldhunga and Sindhupalchowk 46 each.Sapkota informed that his office has sensitised the local bodies about the looming risk of a massive dengue outbreak in the coming days.“Mandatory reporting of dengue cases every day is among the preventive measures through which we can identify dengue hotspots,” said Sapkota. “This will help health workers target such measures in particular areas. Additionally, starting this week, we are resuming the “10 minutes at 10 am” initiative every Friday, during which mosquito breeding grounds will be destroyed.”Officials informed that several local units, including the Kathmandu Metropolitan City, have already started preventive measures against dengue. Dengue symptoms include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes. Patients with these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and proper medical care can prevent death.Doctors say many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and can be treated with paracetamol at home.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district. Since then, an increasing number of dengue infections, including major outbreaks, have been reported from many districts. Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Though the post-monsoon period is considered the dengue epidemic season, the deadly disease has already become endemic in Nepal, as outbreaks are reported every month, including in the winter months.According to health workers, storage places for scrap materials, discarded cups, plastic material tossed in open spaces, and unused lands will be potential hotspots for the dengue virus in the coming days. Health workers have warned the owners of these sites that action will be taken if mosquito larvae are found there.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects, such as plastic cups and bottles, could be breeding grounds for these mosquitoes. \nWith monsoon havoc sweeping across the country, the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division has urged health workers to avoid taking leave during the season.Officials have warned that health facilities could be overwhelmed by patients in the coming days as outbreaks of waterborne and vector-borne diseases are expected, as floodwaters have contaminated most of the drinking water sources.“We have requested the provincial and local health authorities not to grant leave to health workers during the monsoon season,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director of the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Health agencies have been cautioned about the looming risk of outbreaks of waterborne and vector-borne diseases in the coming days.”Torrential rainfall started Friday wreaking havoc in various places across the country. At least 14 people have died in disaster-related incidents—nine in landslides and five in floods—since Friday, according to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority. Officials said 18 others have been injured, and four people are missing. Since the monsoon entered the country on June 10, at least 43 people have died in landslides and flood-related incidents. Lightning strikes killed as many as 19 people during this period.The monsoon season in Nepal is a time of epidemics during which thousands of people across the country become infected with water-borne and vector-borne diseases.The persistent rainfall that started on Friday not only destroyed houses and inundated settlements but also contaminated drinking water sources.Health officials warned that health facilities could witness an uptick in the number of viral fever cases, and waterborne diseases—diarrhoea, dysentery, food poisoning, and snake bites—in the coming days.“We have also requested central hospitals and medical colleges to be prepared for help during disease outbreaks,” said Ghimire. “As we don’t have enough doctors and health workers to deploy to control the outbreaks, we have to seek help from big hospitals and medical colleges.”Officials at the Ministry of Health and Population said that they have been raising awareness through all available means to inform people of the risks. “Essential medicines have been stockpiled, health workers have been asked to be ready for deployment to affected areas, anti-snake venom has been supplied to health facilities,” said Dr Prakash Budhathoki, spokesperson at the Health Ministry. “As of Sunday evening, no outbreaks have been reported.”According to health experts, sources of drinking water generally become contaminated in disaster-hit areas, and people displaced by natural disasters become highly vulnerable to infections with waterborne and vector-borne diseases. Every year, thousands of people get infected with vector-borne diseases such as dengue, kala-azar, malaria, and scrub typhus during this period. Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts. According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,432 people from 73 districts have been infected with the dengue virus since January this year. Among the 73 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases: 159. Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. Likewise, snakebite incidents and resulting deaths are also common during the season, but the phenomenon, which experts dub “a lurking invisible crisis”, remains grossly neglected. “Incidents of snakebites have started to surge over the last few weeks,” said Dr Rajiv Jha, director at Provincial Health Directorate of Madhesh Province. “Along with the surge in waterborne and vector-borne diseases in the coming days, we have anticipated a rise in snakebite cases.”Doctors say the only ways to prevent deaths from waterborne diseases, including diarrhoea, are to raise awareness and ensure safe drinking water.They say a combination of careful surveys, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation and treatment are required to contain the spread of the diarrhoeal infection. \nWith the onset of the rainy season, the incidents of snakebite are on the rise in western Tarai districts.Snakebite treatment centres and hospitals in Kanchanpur and Kailali districts of Sudurpaschim province are now crowded with snakebite patients. Treatment of the snakebite patients, according to health workers, is quite challenging as patients are often brought to the health facilities at the last minute.As many as 60 snakebite patients visited the Snakebite Treatment Centre set up by Nepal Army at Arjuni of Shuklaphanta National Park within the past three weeks. “Over the past one week three to four snakebite patients have been visiting the centre on a daily basis,” said Ratan Bohora, a paramedic at the Arjuni-based Snakebite Treatment Centre. The local residents have hugely benefited after the Nepali Army and the local community jointly established the snakebite treatment centre at Arjuni in 2014. The centre, however, has to refer the patients with serious health conditions to other well facilitated hospitals due to the lack of an intensive care unit (ICU) and ventilator. “Two patients who were bitten by poisonous snakes were referred to Mahakali Provincial Hospital in Mahendranagar this year. We have no alternative but to send serious cases of snakebite to other hospitals due to the lack of the ICU and ventilator facilities,” said Bohora. The centre also does not even have a monitor to track a patient's vital signs such as blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen levels. The flow of the patients is increasing, but the centre only has two paramedics to provide treatment.Incidents of snakebite and resulting deaths are common in Nepal, but the issue still remains grossly neglected as what experts call a lurking ‘invisible crisis’. Each year, around 2,700 people, mostly children and women from Nepal’s Tarai region, die of snakebites, according to a March 2022 report.Most snakebite incidents occur when farmers are transplanting paddy fields or children are playing outdoors. Health workers say that the snakes that live in water are generally less poisonous. “The cases that are most serious occurred at night, often inside houses. Such patients should be taken to hospital immediately,” said Bohora. According to him, people living in thatched-roof houses are especially vulnerable to snakebite, because snakes often enter such homes in search of rats.Nepal is home to around 17 highly venomous snakes. Each year, the country sees about 20,000 to 40,000 cases of snakebite. The numbers could be higher, as many cases of snakebite go unreported, health workers say.Another health challenge in rural Nepal is the superstitious belief in visiting shamans instead of seeking treatment at medical facilities for snakebite. Experts say awareness drives should be launched to educate people that the snakebite patients should be taken to the hospital at the earliest. They recommend promoting cleanliness around homes, preventing children from playing in bushy areas, avoiding nightime walks, and using torchlight while walking in the dark.“Treatment of snakebite patients is possible if they are taken to health facilities on time. Patients are often brought to the hospital only after their condition has worsened, resulting in serious consequences,” said Dr Arjun Bhatta, medical superintendent at Mahakali Provincial Hospital. According to him, 10 snakebite patients with serious health conditions visited the hospital in the past three weeks. “They returned home after treatment,” said Bhatta. \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar. \nThe noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built. Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nGermany’s Thomas Mueller has called time on his 14-year international career after their European Championship exit, the Bayern Munich forward said on Monday.The 34-year-old featured in his eighth and last tournament on July 5, in Germany’s 2-1 quarter-final defeat by Spain, where he was brought on as a substitute in the 80th minute.Muller helped Germany win the 2014 World Cup and has the third most appearances for the national team with 131 caps and 45 goals. He also won the Golden Boot and Young Player Award during the 2010 World Cup, when Germany finished third.“It always made me very proud to play for my country. We celebrated together and sometimes shed a tear together,” Muller said in a farewell video on social media.“When I had the privilege of making my first international appearance, I would never have dreamed of all this. I would like to say thank you to all the fans and my Germany teammates for their support over the years. Take the enthusiasm and joy of this year’s Euros with you.”“Nobody is like Thomas Muller. His value for German football cannot be overestimated,” German national team chief Rudi Voeller said in a statement.“Regardless of whether he’s been with Bayern or the national team for all these years, Thomas has always given every team a face, an exemplary character and a top striker.” \nDefending champions Argentina won a record 16th Copa America title by beating Colombia 1-0 thanks to an extra-time goal from substitute Lautaro Martinez at the Hard Rock Stadium in Florida on Sunday.The game, which was delayed by more than an hour after thousands of fans without tickets tried to enter the stadium, was a cagey affair over 90 minutes but opened up in the extra period.Martinez, the tournament’s leading scorer, latched onto a precise through ball from Giovani Lo Celso before lifting his effort over advancing Colombia goalkeeper Camilo Vargas in the 112nd minute to spark wild celebrations among Argentina fans.Argentina’s latest title comes on the back of their triumphs at the 2022 World Cup and 2021 Copa America, and gives eight-times Ballon d’Or winner Lionel Messi the perfect sendoff in what is likely his last international tournament.Colombia started the match by pressing high up the pitch and Jhon Cordoba hit the post in the seventh minute before Jefferson Lerma and Richard Rios had long-range efforts saved by Argentina goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez.Messi appeared to hurt his ankle in the 36th minute after a collision with Santiago Arias and while he got back to his feet after receiving treatment he was clearly hampered for the remainder of the half.Colombia went on the offensive again in the second half with Arias and Davinson Sanchez coming close to scoring.Argentina soaked up the pressure well but were dealt a blow in the 66th minute when Messi limped off due to the ankle injury.They continued to grew into the contest and had a goal disallowed for offside but Colombia held on as the match went to extra time.The defending champions continued to push forward in extra time, testing Vargas with a shot from Nico Gonzalez before Martinez finally found the breakthrough.Argentina’s win also ended a record 28-match unbeaten streak for Colombia, whose last defeat also came against ‘La Albiceleste’ in February 2022. \nSpain’s Mikel Oyarzabal scored four minutes from time as they capped a dominant Euro 2024 campaign with a deserved 2-1 win over England in Sunday’s showpiece for a record fourth title and condemned their opponents to a second straight final defeat.Oyarzabal finished off a swift counter-attack for the winner after England had fought back from a goal down for the fourth successive match and seemingly earned extra-time.“I have done my job,” said Oyarzabal, who came on for captain Alvaro Morata after 67 minutes. “Just the fact of being in the 26, you value it a lot. It happened to me but could have happened to anyone.”Spain manager Luis de la Fuente added: “I couldn’t be happier. A real team, European champions. I said I was proud and today I am even prouder. It confirms what we are. For me, they are the best in the world.”After a cautious first half where Spain had 65% possession but England’s Phil Foden managed the only shot on target, the Spaniards struck two minutes after the restart, despite losing influential midfielder Rodri to injury at the break.Teenager Lamine Yamal, who had been shackled completely in the first half, finally found space down the right and crossed for Nico Williams to slot home past goalkeeper Jordan Pickford.Spain then enjoyed a purple patch with a series of sharp attacks as England’s previously watertight defence lost its shape and Dani Olmo, Morata and Williams all had good chances.England manager Gareth Southgate sent on Ollie Watkins, the scoring substitute hero of the semi-final, for an ineffective Harry Kane after an hour, with Cole Palmer, England’s most creative player in the last month, joining him 10 minutes later.PAY OFFThe changes paid off almost immediately when Jude Bellingham laid the ball back into Palmer’s path and the substitute curled home a precise low 20-metre shot in the 73rd minute.The massed ranks of England fans, who vastly outnumbered their rivals, exploded and the whole feel of the night changed.But Spain weathered the storm and a lapse of concentration saw England undone as Marc Cucurella was left in space on the left, received the ball from Oyarzabal and drilled it across the box for the substitute to stretch out a toe and poke it home.There was still time for more drama as Spain keeper Unai Simon parried a Declan Rice header from a corner and Dani Olmo then brilliantly headed away Marc Guehi’s follow up on the line.It meant that Spain added a fourth title to those won in 1964, 2008 and 2012 and, as only the third team in the last nine Euros to win the trophy without coming through a shootout at some point in the tournament following France (2000) and Greece (2004), nobody can deny they were worthy winners.For England the “30 years of hurt” after their 1966 World Cup success, which was the soundtrack to their hosting of Euro 96, will now run to at least double that number as they became the first team to lose successive Euro finals“We’ve competed until the very end of the final,” said Southgate, who is widely expected to step down having remarkably led his country to two Euro finals and World Cup semi and quarter-finals in his eight years in charge.“I think we didn’t keep possession of the ball quite well enough. They press you really well and you've got to get out of that pressure and we weren’t able to do that and in the end that meant they had more control of the game“The players have got to take enormous credit for getting us to the point they did. They way they fought and represented the shirt with pride. They were never beaten until the very end, the final five minutes of the last game and then that chance at the end. Just the character and resilience that they’ve shown.“It’s fine margins, but I think they (Spain) were the best team in the tournament and they deserved to win.” \nIsrael struck the southern and central Gaza Strip on Monday to put more pressure on Hamas, following a weekend strike targeting the militant group’s leadership, which killed scores of Palestinians who had sought shelter in a makeshift camp.Two days after the Israeli strike turned a crowded swathe of Mawasi near the Mediterranean coast into a charred wasteland littered with burning cars and mangled bodies, displaced survivors said they had no idea where they should go next.“Those moments as the ground shook underneath my feet and the dust and sand rose to the sky and I saw dismembered bodies - was like nothing I have seen in my life,” said Aya Mohammad, 30, a market seller in Mawasi, reached by mobile text message.“Where to go is what everybody asks, and no one has the answer.”Mawasi on the western outskirts of Khan Younis has been sheltering hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who fled to the area after Israel declared it a safe zone. Israel said its strike there on Saturday targeted Hamas military commander Mohammed Deif, an architect of the October 7 assault on Israeli towns and villages that triggered the Gaza war.The military said it struck an open area, with several buildings and sheds, adding it was a compound run by Hamas and not a tented camp.Palestinian officials say at least 90 people were killed on Saturday and many hundreds wounded. Reuters journalists at the scene filmed carnage, with residents carrying the wounded and dead amid flames and smoke.Further south in Rafah, the main focus of Israel’s advance since May, residents reported renewed fighting on Monday. Israeli forces in western and central parts of the city blew up several homes, they said. Medical officials said they recovered 10 bodies of Palestinians killed by Israeli fire in eastern areas of the city, some of which had already begun to decompose.The military also stepped up aerial and tank shelling in central Gaza in the Al-Bureij and Al-Maghazi historic refugee camps. Health officials said five Palestinians were killed in an Israeli air strike on a house in Maghazi camp.Palestinian health officials said 11 Palestinians were killed in an Israeli air strike on a house in Al-Nuseirat camp in central Gaza Strip earlier on Monday.The Israeli military said the air forces struck dozens of Palestinian military targets across Gaza, killing many gunmen. It said forces killed gunmen in Rafah and central Gaza, sometimes in close combat.A statement from the Al-Quds brigade, the armed wing of the Islamic Jihad militant group, said its fighters were engaged in fierce battles in the Yabna camp in Rafah.Later on Monday, in Deir Al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip, where Israel hasn’t yet invaded and hundreds of thousands have taken refuge, the municipality issued an urgent statement saying it was no longer able to provide 700,000 people in the area with drinking water after running out of fuel.“We urge citizens to preserve what is left in their private tankers and we stress the need to maintain the spirit of cooperation and sharing,” the statement said.Speaking amidst the rubble of his family home in Deir Al-Balah, Walid Thabet told how an Israeli strike earlier on Monday had killed members of his family. Rescue workers and neighbours sifted through the debris to search for survivors buried beneath the wrecked building.“My mother, an elderly woman, was sitting with me upstairs. She went downstairs and after five minutes, I pulled her out from under the rubble. We also pulled my sister out from under the rubble, and my sister’s children too,” said Thabet.“Those who died are my mother, my sister, and my sister’s children. Children! One was two and a half years old, and the other two, I don’t know what happened to them. God willing, may God save them,” he added.CEASEFIRE TALKSSaturday’s carnage in Mawasi, one of the deadliest Israeli strikes of the war, has overshadowed negotiations that both sides had previously described as the closest yet to a lasting ceasefire. A senior Hamas official said on Sunday the group had not walked out of the talks despite the Mawasi strike.Israel says another senior commander was killed in the strike but it has not yet confirmed the fate of Deif. Hamas officials have denied Deif was killed.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Israeli National Security Advisor Tzachi Hanegbi and Israel's Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer in Washington on Monday to discuss “practical solutions that we have in mind” to bridge differences between Israel and Hamas on a ceasefire deal, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said.“I will tell you what we heard directly from two senior advisors to Prime Minister (Benjamin) Netanyahu today, and that is that Israel is still committed to reaching a ceasefire.... There are a few remaining sticking points and we’re working to try and resolve those. We’re committed to trying to do that.”Following the Israeli strike targeting Deif, Blinken expressed “serious concern about the recent civilian casualties in Gaza,” Miller said, adding that Israel had a right to target militants but must do more to reduce civilian casualties.The Gaza health ministry said at least 38,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s military offensive since October 7. It does not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants but officials say most of the dead throughout the war have been civilians.Israel says it has lost 326 soldiers in Gaza and says at least a third of the Palestinian fatalities are fighters.The war began after a Hamas-led attack inside Israel on October 7, by militants who killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took more than 250 hostage to Gaza, according to Israeli authorities.Citing a report by the United Nations Environment Programme, the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA said in a post on X it would take 15 years to clear around 40 million tons of war rubble in Gaza. The effort would need 100+ trucks and cost over $500 million“Debris pose a deadly threat for people in the #GazaStrip as it can contain unexploded ordnance and harmful substances,” it added.The United Nations said on Monday that it will start bringing in more armored vehicles and personal protection equipment for its humanitarian aid operations in the Gaza Strip after receiving approval from Israeli authorities.The UN has long complained of obstacles to getting aid into Gaza - Israel inspects and approves all trucks - and says it is also struggling to distribute aid amid “total lawlessness” within the enclave of 2.3 million people, where a global hunger monitor last month said there is a high risk of famine. \nDonald Trump was in Milwaukee on Monday to make final preparations for the Republican presidential nomination later this week after narrowly escaping an assassination attempt that he said presented an opportunity to bring the country together.Trump, 78, was holding a campaign rally on Saturday in Butler, Pennsylvania - a key state in the Nov. 5 election - when a 20-year-old man with an AR-15-style rifle got close enough to shoot at the former Republican president from a rooftop.One shot hit Trump’s upper right ear, leaving his face streaked with blood, but he was not severely wounded.“That reality is just setting in,” Trump told the Washington Examiner on Sunday. “I rarely look away from the crowd. Had I not done that in that moment, well, we would not be talking today, would we?”One person in the crowd was killed and two others wounded before Secret Service agents fatally shot the suspect.On Sunday, both Trump and President Joe Biden counseled calm and unity in a country whose a deep political divide has grown more pronounced during the presidential race.“There is no place in America for this kind of violence, for any violence ever. Period. No exceptions,” he said. “We can’t allow this violence to be normalized.”“The political rhetoric in this country has gotten very heated. It’s time to cool it down,” Biden said in a televised address from the Oval Office.World leaders condemned the attack, opens new tab, with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer saying he was “appalled by the shocking scenes” and French President Emanuel Macron calling the assassination attempt “a tragedy for our democracies”.Trump pumped his fist in the air several times on Sunday appearing to mouth the words “Fight! Fight! Fight!”, as he descended the stairs from his plane after arriving in Milwaukee, where he will accept his party’s formal nomination at the Republican National Convention on Thursday.“This is a chance to bring the whole country, even the whole world, together. The speech will be a lot different, a lot different than it would’ve been two days ago,” Trump told the Washington Examiner.“I want to try to unite our country,” the New York Post reported Trump saying during the same interview, conducted during the flight to Milwaukee. “But I don’t know if that’s possible. People are very divided.”Biden, a Democrat, ordered an independent review of how the gunman, who was shot dead by agents moments after opening fire, could have taken up an elevated position so close to Trump, who as a former president has lifetime protection by the US Secret Service.Biden and Trump spoke to each other on Saturday night after the shooting.The two are locked in a close election rematch, according to most opinion polls including by Reuters/Ipsos. The shooting on Saturday whipsawed discussion around the presidential campaign, which had been focused on whether Biden, 81, should drop out following a halting June 27 debate performance.Suspect a nursing home aideThe FBI identified Thomas Matthew Crooks of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, as the suspect and said the shooting was being investigated as an attempted assassination.FBI officials said on Sunday that the shooter acted alone.The agency said it had yet to identify an ideology linked to the suspect or any indications of mental health issues or found any threatening language on the suspect’s social media accounts.Crooks was a registered Republican, according to state voter records, and donated $15 to a Democratic political action committee when he was 17. At the time of the shooting, he was employed as a dietary aide at the Bethel Park Skilled Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, which said Crooks’ background check was clean.The gun - an AR-style-5.56 caliber rifle - had been legally bought, said FBI officials, who believed it had been purchased by the suspect’s father.The officials said “a suspicious device” was found in the suspect’s vehicle, which was inspected by bomb technicians and rendered safe.The Secret Service denied accusations by some Trump supporters that it had rejected a campaign request for more security.The shots on Saturday appeared to come from outside the area secured by the Secret Service, the agency said.Spectator killed protecting familyThe rally attendee killed on Saturday was identified by authorities as Corey Comperatore, 50, of Sarver, Pennsylvania. He died trying to protect his family from the hail of bullets, said Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro.Two people wounded in the shooting were in a stable condition on Sunday. Pennsylvania State identified them as David Dutch, 57, of New Kensington, Pennsylvania and James Copenhaver, 74, of Moon Township, Pennsylvania.The attack was the first shooting of a US president or major party presidential candidate since the 1981 attempted assassination of Republican President Ronald Reagan. \nUnauthorized translations of popular international books, including Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin's works, flood Nepal's book market, undermining authors, publishers, and the quality of literature for readers.\nBharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality’s ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via ‘tallo bato’—backdoor route—and that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal. \nPrivate hospitals in major cities in Nepal, including Pokhara, Chitwan, Biratnagar, and Butwal, widely ignore government regulations requiring them to provide free treatment to the needy, leaving patients like Gyanumaya BK in financial hardship, while regulatory bodies fail to enforce compliance.\nThis year’s monsoon arrived on June 11, three days earlier than the usual onset date, bringing rain to the eastern parts of Nepal. However, it didn’t move to the rest of the country, which was reeling under a heat wave with temperatures reaching as high as 44 degrees Celsius for weeks. Most initial rainfall predictions failed, and the monsoon that reached the central parts two weeks later was heavy and destructive. In the early hours of June 26, a mudslide in Lamjung district damaged three houses and killed four people—a 67-year-old man, his daughter-in-law and her two young daughters. By July 6, the monsoon was active throughout the country, causing widespread damage to roads and settlements. Landslides reported in 157 places disrupted vehicular movement on most hill roads. The death toll due to landslides alone reached 53, with 19 others killed by floods. On July 12, debris flow on the Muglin-Narayangarh road pushed two buses into the Trishuli River; of the total 65 passengers in the two buses, three were found alive, five found dead and the rest are missing. These early events illustrate the erratic and unreliable nature of monsoons, as has been expected due to a warmer climate. They are also a cause for concern as these emerging trends have affected our economy and livelihoods and led to increased disaster events. Most of these disasters, like the one in Lamjung, could have been prevented with aptly developed stormwater management strategies that our disaster preparedness initiatives have consistently ignored. The changes The monsoon is gradually changing its intensity, rainfall patterns and timing. On July 8, around 624 mm of rain was measured over a single day in Dodhara of Kanchanpur district. It replaced the 1993 record of 540 mm in 24 hours recorded in Kulekhani. The rainfall events are often localised and dominated by high-intensity, short-duration rain. Even then, when one area gets heavy rain, the adjoining area may remain dry. Such an anomaly is more pronounced in mountainous terrain due to its orographic effects. The conventional rainfall forecast does not capture such variance nor does the data from existing meteorological stations provide adequate and real-time information for analysis and planning. The rainfall pattern has also changed. In a country-wide survey conducted by the National Statistics Office in 2022, about 90 percent of respondents across all geographical regions observed changes in the rainfall pattern between June and September—a similar percent of respondents also saw differences in the rainfall pattern during winter. The monsoon is also shifting northward, bringing rain in areas at higher altitudes like Manang and Mustang districts, which normally get either snow or remain dry during the monsoon. Similar studies conducted in Pakistan to assess such a shift indicated that the monsoons there have also moved northward. The study also stated another worrying concern: This shift has made the southern areas, which previously received normal rain, drier as they get less rain now. A similar trend was also observed in India, where some areas in the Gangetic plains have received less rain. However, areas that were arid in the past, particularly in the western part of the country, have started to receive more rain, causing aberrant floods. Required strategyLocal water sources are crucial for most economic activities, particularly farming and sustaining rivulets and khola. The general understanding of the importance of local water issues has grown in the last decade: How haphazard road construction has increased landslides in the hills, how sealing of surfaces in the plains and drainage congestions have led to a growing scourge of urban flooding or how encroachment in the river banks has compounded flood damage. However, the corrective action required remains very slow compared to the changing pace of rainfall patterns. Instead of considering these budding nuances, our approach to both development in general and infrastructure in particular has consistently ignored them—a cost we are bound to bear in the years ahead. The drainage structures rebuilt to accommodate runoff on the major roads in the capital in the last five years have been proven inadequate to drain rainwater during heavy rains. The conventional agriculture rhythm no longer matches this changing context. The shift is inconveniencing those who have adapted their farming and other economic activities to the usual timing and levels of rain/snow. The rice saplings prepared for plantation in the second half of June, for example, matured and became less productive when the rains arrived late for transplantation. Those who planted the right-age saplings on time by pumping water also lost crops when the rain came late due to a dry spell in between. To avoid this threat to our food security and farmers’ economic prospects, it’s time we matched the agricultural rhythm to the changing monsoonal pattern.Engaging the youth Changes in the monsoon are likely to be more pronounced in the years ahead. Unless we enhance our capacity to manage water at the local level, we’re bound to suffer. Hydrological analysis in this altered context requires substantial decentralised data because rainfall’s localised nature often becomes runoff and fails to enter the subsurface to replenish soil moisture and aquifers. In this regard, an example of a community-driven initiative started by the state government of Kerala, India, is worth considering. To generate rainfall data that was as decentralised as possible, they have installed well-equipped weather stations in over 270 government schools in the state and trained students to record changes in rain and temperature to help them understand rainfall anomalies and adopt necessary measures for water management. Kerala’s community-driven initiative to engage, train and empower the decision-makers of tomorrow is an excellent way of ensuring a deeper appreciation of changing rainfall patterns across geographical zones and helping build appropriate strategies to meet local needs. Assisting schools in installing weather stations to monitor rainfall and recognising local water issues will provide future decision-makers with an encompassing awareness of the evolving nature of monsoons and formulate strategies, including affordable and actionable tactics to manage water at the local level. Youth engagement can be further reinforced by introducing practical classes as part of the curriculum on building water harvesting structures, such as small ponds, and monitoring their progress periodically while they’re in school. This will help them gain invaluable knowledge about rainfall, local hydrology and understanding how managing rainwater is, in fact, crucial to sustaining our lives and our environment in a warmer world.  \nNepali politics is full of absurdities. If governmental stability is boring and nauseating, instability is a pastime for politicians. The more we observe Nepali politics, the more it looks like a pantomime or what we call nautanki. All such manoeuvrings and manipulations, aided and abetted by high-sounding rhetoric of stability and progress, are, in fact, leading the country nowhere. Politics is becoming uglier each day, resulting in stagnation and uncertainty. Moreover, the political parties’ leaders do not hesitate to call such grotesque doings democratic exercises. The latest event is the sudden change of alliances between the CPN (UML) and the Maoist Centre. Now, KP Sharma Oli has joined hands with the Nepali Congress’s (NC) Deuba to exchange the post of prime minister at intervals. The 10-year Maoist insurgency in Nepal ultimately landed in a hostile environment the Maoist Party had always denounced as inappropriate for the country. For the Maoists, the violent revolution à la Maoist variant was the apotheosis of transformation and progress. In its wake, the 2005-06 revolution paid rich dividends to the Maoist leaders by catapulting them into the high stage of Nepali politics, making them the first party in the first Constituent Assembly elections held in 2008 and enabling them to head the government. However, its first stint in government was short-lived when it miscalculated and overstretched its strength. The haste with which it tried to grab power by entering the domain of the Nepal Army turned out to be counterproductive. Here, the president’s constitutional role was extended to refusing the recommendation of the prime minister to fire the chief of the army staff, resulting in the ouster of the prime minister in less than 10 months. Any politician who forgets the surface of political reality is destined to fall, and it happened to comrade Pushpa Kamal Dahal, whose long schooling in Maoist ideology and practices of war didn’t work in the most inhospitable context of Nepali politics and society.Moreover, Leninism and Maoism espoused by the communist parties—Leninism for the CPN (UML) and Maoism for the Maoist Centre—are neither tenable nor practicable, as the revolution launched by the latter landed in a compromise with its own ‘class enemies’ and ‘reactionaries’. It was indeed a U-turn for Dahal and his colleagues. The CPN (UML) metamorphosed when it suddenly changed its chrysalis into a multiparty system in 1990. Originating from the Jhapa violent movement that adopted Marxist-Leninist Maoist ideology, it eventually joined the restoration of the multiparty movement launched under the stewardship of the NC and subsequently became a systemic party. Now, all the parties subscribe to the multiparty system, albeit with various banners and rhetoric. Still, in substance, they are co-sharers of power and privileges with the much-denounced NC. Originating and evolving as the first liberal party, the NC has the credentials of being a believer in liberal democracy, notwithstanding the deficiencies of this ideology. Now, the NC, like others, is also in the quagmire of dirty politics, indulging in making and breaking alliances forged as a result of the fractured electoral mandate handed down to them. Yet, despite heavy odds encountered by the parties in the past, all of them (including the NC) have a tendency to disfigure the beautiful edifice of republican order. Although their perseverance and dedication to presenting a constitution prepared by the CA was/is commendable, the manner in which they are bent on destroying the spirit of the republic is equally despicable. All their activities are carried out in the name of stability and progress, under the subterfuge of regression and backlash. The democracy we have adopted did not develop by fits and starts as it did in Britain and the Netherlands. These two countries have been able to sustain democracy without giving rise to occasional upheavals that upset democratic stability. Unlike them, France’s top-down approach didn’t allow democracy to strike roots or provide stability. Thus, Britain remains an exception to many other aspirants to democracy. What went wrong with Nepal’s democratic experience? The answers are many and wide-ranging. First, the ideological moorings and orientations of political parties are spurious. Since many come from opposite ideological orientations and actions, it has taken a long time for them to internalise political culture. Even the NC, the so-called grand old party of liberal democracy, has derailed the system by making unholy alliances to remain in power. Although no party can become a purist in today’s political churnings, the NC could have become a role model in laying the foundation of democracy. But its leaders are as self-seeking as others. In the post-1990 multiparty era and under the present Republican dispensation, the NC has failed to show its distinct identity, rather indulging in self-aggrandisement and misgovernance. Changes of governments under any pretext and parroting the rhetoric of democratic credibility would not suffice in the uncanny political context. The second is the crisis of leadership. Most parties’ leaders have been tested by people who perceive them as lacking vision, commitment and determination to advance the agendas of progress. The same leaders who have forfeited public trust are lured by the posts and power. They have allowed the system to rot by indulging in pastime politics, rendering the people silent spectators. Leaders are generally neither transformatory nor honest while discharging their duties in government and opposition. Since leadership is a crucial variable in the early phase of political evolution and change in all dimensions, Nepali leaders even fail to be transactional. They take pride in becoming prime ministers many times without leaving behind the imprints of their governance. Third, the absurdity is begotten by the failures to put institutions on track, as many institutions created by the constitution or others outside it are spoiled by excessive politicisation in the respective parties’ lines. So, institutions are virtually lifeless and hardly generate the popular faith in leadership with which the system needs to revolve. Finally, experiences over the years have shown that opportunistic politics do not allow coalition governments to last for a fixed term because Nepali parties are not made for coalition politics. \nAccording to recent statistics from the World Bank (2023), the unemployment rate among the youth labour force (ages 15-24) in Nepal is 21 percent, a slight increase from 20 percent in 2017. This rate is higher than the regional average. Additionally, older statistics from the International Labour Organisation indicate that approximately 26.1 percent of university graduates in Nepal are unemployed. Most of these graduates are employed in routine jobs. With the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI), many of these positions are at risk of being replaced by AI and automation. As it is often said, \"AI won’t replace humans, but humans with AI will replace humans without AI.” Despite this precarious situation, Nepal is home to an aspirational youth population eager to establish themselves in the growing domestic and foreign economies. These youths need employable skills relevant to today's digital and AI-driven world to climb the economic ladder.As global digitalisation and the adoption of AI and data science transform various sectors, the demand for new skill sets is increasing both nationally and internationally. Organisations are becoming more AI-driven, rendering many traditional job roles obsolete. Consequently, students worldwide must acquire AI skills to remain competitive in the future job market. This trend is particularly relevant for Nepal's Higher Education Institutions (HEIs), where there is a significant data science and AI skills gap. Data science combines mathematics, statistics, specialised programming, advanced analytics, AI and machine learning to uncover actionable insights hidden within organisational data. Based on our interactions with students and corporate entities in Nepal, this piece examines the pressing need to integrate data science and AI into Nepal’s HEIs curriculum. Given the low employability rate among university graduates in Nepal, it is imperative to equip them with these essential skills. Best practicesAddressing these issues requires significant interventions at both policy and strategic levels. India's example reveals a massive impetus from government and private stakeholders on AI skilling over the past several years. Numerous skilling programmes on data science are available in India, ranging from secondary schooling to doctoral levels. Under government initiatives like Skill India, large-scale programmes have been completed and are ongoing to reskill and upskill the workforce in these areas. For instance, many Indian states have introduced Python programming as a compulsory or elective course in secondary school curricula to expose young minds to AI and data skills. Likewise, AI-related courses are going to be added to China’s education system, including primary and secondary schools.What needs to be doneA similar curriculum intervention is necessary in Nepal to cultivate young Nepali minds with data and programming skills for future AI roles. Currently, only a few top-notch business schools in Nepal have incorporated Python coding into their curriculum. However, this practice is not widespread. For undergraduate and graduate curricula across all professional HEI courses in Nepal, introducing data science skills in applied statistics, R programming, Python programming, SQL, data visualisation (using tools like Tableau), machine learning, and deep learning is essential. Additionally, each data science course should include at least one compulsory industry guest lecture (physical or online) from AI or data science experts, whether from Nepal or globally. This will ensure that students know the latest AI trends relevant to the industry.Furthermore, there should be more industry-academia collaborative projects wherein industries can offer real-time data science challenges to students through physical and virtual hackathons. From the perspective of skilling HEI educators, upskilling and Faculty Development Programmes (FDP) should be organised to familiarise them with the latest data science and AI tools. Such programmes should be incentivised to motivate educators to engage actively and learn from these opportunities. Educators skilled in these programmes should be encouraged to work on research projects connecting AI to their field of expertise, with the aim of filing patents or copyrights or publishing them in reputable journals. As the world transitions from Industry 3.0 to Industry 4.0 and soon to Industry 5.0, Nepal must also move its industrial and economic sectors in the same direction using AI and data science.Implementing these interventions would gradually build a culture of AI, data science, and innovation among Nepal's student community, addressing the existing skill gap. Moreover, such initiatives would foster the growth of AI-powered startups in Nepal, providing solutions for various socio-economic and business challenges. Nepal's recent launch of a concept paper on the application and practice of AI is a welcome move. However, it is crucial to formulate how AI can be integrated into the curriculum to ensure that future graduates possess the necessary skills.In conclusion, by incorporating data science and AI into HEIs, Nepal can better prepare its students for the uncertain future job market and foster innovation and economic growth. \nPrime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is all set to go today. After being taken for a ride turn-by-turn by a distant third CPN (Maoist Centre) led by Dahal, the two big parties in Parliament—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—have joined hands to form a coalition government. And with this, Dahal, who remained at or around the power centre for almost a decade even with his party performing poorly in polls, is pushed to the periphery—at least for a while. The overzealous commentaries about Dahal being thrown off the grid of power may, however, be premature. As per the current constitutional provisions, coalition culture is here to stay. And considering how adamant the political parties are in sticking to their morally corrupt politics, no one can tell if the impending Congress-UML coalition stays for the next three months or three years. As Dahal goes today, there does not seem to be much point assessing how well his coalition with the UML fared in just four months of its existence. It takes decades, even centuries, to build a nation. The five-year term of Parliament is the minimum required for a set of leaders to make some impactful decisions for the country. There certainly are provisions for changes in the government, even in the midst of the parliamentary term, but these should be exceptional cases. What we have got, however, is a perpetuity of the coalition culture. It is this perpetuity that has halted the nation-building process for decades now. With the same set of three old men playing the hot potato game around power, nation-building has become a staccato performance at best. Just as one performer comes to the stage and starts his performance, he is pushed to the sidelines in the middle of the act.Pushpa Kamal Dahal will perform the last scene of the four-month act that was his coalition. He will come on stage, search for UML chairperson KP Sharma Oli among the audience, and call him a betrayer. He will then look for the Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba and blame him for being power-hungry. Oli and Deuba will then take the stage by turns and blame Dahal for trying to take them for fools. Such acts have been repeatedly performed, with the same set of plots, performances and actors. There is certainly a new actor on the block, a television presenter who thought he had had enough of shouting out of the small screen. He stepped out of the screen into the field and competed with the old guards whose noses he wanted to break—as his infamous saying went.The moment Rabi Lamichhane came to the spotlight after an impressive electoral showing, the masks he had worn all along started falling off. After a while, he became the fourth old man in the club of politicians who see fault in everyone else besides themselves. Only that Lamichhane was louder, more contemptuous of the media, and as directionless as the other three when it came to envisioning a future for the nation. As Dahal is forced to step down and Oli is about to take the helm, it is worth pondering if this sordid cycle of drama will end anytime soon.  \nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has recently come under fire, both in India and abroad, for hugging Russian President Vladimir Putin even as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine shows no sign of ceasing. As expected, among the fiercest critics of the infamous hug is Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who called it a “huge disappointment and a devastating blow to peace efforts”. As Putin continues to be made a pariah by the Western world for his continued attack on Ukraine, India under Modi has made it clear that the world’s largest democracy cares more about the India-Russia military-industrial complex than international humanitarian concerns. Ordinary Indians do not seem to care about the intricacies of the Modi-Putin deal for arms trade. But they certainly do about the fact that Modi has convinced Putin to return the Indians who have been fighting Russia’s war against Ukraine. Like Nepalis, Indians, too, have been lured into joining the Russian Army. Like the Nepalis, Indian recruits have realised that the war is no walk in the park, that their agents sold them false dreams, and they now want to return home. Like the Nepalis, the Indians, too, have been killed in the senseless war, although in lesser numbers. According to Indian media, at least four Indians have been killed, while between 30 and 40 others are serving in the Russian Army. In contrast, a staggering 35 Nepalis have been killed in the war, while around 150 are still on the battlefield, waiting for the Nepali state to intervene and ensure their homecoming. Apart from returning those alive, Russia has also offered to expedite compensation to the families of the deceased Indian recruits. This is in sharp contrast to the fate of the deceased Nepalis, whose families have yet to receive any compensation. It has been months since the families of the fallen Nepalis started lobbying, demonstrating and organising sit-ins to put pressure on the government to take up the matter with its Russian counterpart. Government officials, including various foreign ministers, have claimed to be coordinating with Russian officials to repatriate the Nepali recruits. But the results are for all to see: Russia has turned a deaf ear to all such pleas.Notably, the recent agreement between Modi and Putin, which has yet to be made public, is the result of continuous homework by Indian government officials rather than just an outcome of Modi’s dinnertime charm offensive with Putin. The Indian Embassy in Moscow was consistently raising this issue. Likewise, Foreign minister S. Jaishankar was making a strong case for it in his meeting with the Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation in Astana, Kazakhstan, last week. This shows how the Indian government has been using multiple channels to ensure the repatriation of its citizens. Having faced almost 10 times the number of Indian casualties, Nepal’s plight is comparatively more dire. Nepal must, therefore, double up its efforts by putting diplomatic pressure, even using Russia’s allies, including India, to expedite the return of the Nepalis. First, Nepal must again summon the Russian ambassador to Nepal, Aleksei Novikov, and make him answerable for Russia’s failure to repatriate Nepali citizens becoming collateral damages in its senseless war with Ukraine. Of course, we don’t expect Pushpa Kamal Dahal and his government to wield the kind of diplomatic clout of Modi and his country, the fifth largest economy in the world. What galls is that the Nepali state has been unable to harness even its limited diplomatic apparatus for such a noble and urgent cause.  \nAs much as we love the monsoon for its greenery and promise of a bountiful harvest, we dread floods, landslides and diseases. As in years past, disasters have wreaked havoc in several parts of Nepal this year too, leading to at least 70 deaths since June. Adding to the woes are vector- and water-borne diseases, such as viral fever, diarrhoea, dysentery, food poisoning, typhoid, dengue and kala-azar, turning the season into a time of epidemics. The Epidemiology and Disease Control Division has already warned doctors and the public of possible uptick in incidents of these diseases.In 2022, as a result of contaminated water, Kathmandu Valley saw an outbreak of cholera, with 77 positive cases reported. The same year, diarrheal diseases affected hundreds of people for many months. Just last month, a patient tested positive for the Vibrio cholerae 01 Ogawa serotype at the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital, of which the authorities were reportedly unaware, as per a Post report. This is not a good sign, as many cases usually go unreported because people don’t visit hospitals unless there’s an emergency, and a lack of investigation from the government means no awareness about the possible spread of cholera. Such negligence about a deadly disease will only fuel its spread.Moreover, the dengue outbreak in the country has gone out of hand over the years. According to official records, the virus has circulated to 73 districts, infecting almost 1,500 people since January. What is concerning is that these numbers could go up, as we aren’t even halfway through this monsoon, and the dengue virus lasts until post-monsoon. Additionally, climate change and rising temperatures have pushed the disease even into the winter season. Recently, health experts have also been worried about the possible instances of the Zika virus (similar to dengue) in Nepal, as cases are being detected in the southern neighbour India. The outbreaks of these diseases and their prolonged presence can easily drain the healthcare facilities of an under-resourced country like ours. In the monsoon crisis, the poor and vulnerable suffer the most, as their condition is compounded by contaminated water, floods, landslides, and other monsoon-related disasters. This not only affects their treatment-seeking behaviour but also their ability to adopt preventive measures, which could in turn lead to community-level transmission of diseases.The Epidemic and Outbreak Surveillance of the Ministry of Health is tasked with collecting data on diseases, informing the general public, and encouraging policymakers to take necessary actions against outbreaks and make people aware of them. Moreover, it also regularly monitors drinking water quality and does surveillance of water-borne diseases. In recent months, it has found harmful substances like faecal coliform in bottled water and even tap water in some places in the Kathmandu Valley. These findings suggest the surveillance and monitoring mechanism in the country has to be strengthened, and local units around the country should be made responsible for keeping their water resources safe throughout the year, especially during the monsoon, to prevent possible outbreaks of water-borne diseases. In the case of vector-borne dengue, Zika and chikungunya viruses, a year-round door-to-door search and destruction of mosquito breeding areas is a must.Nepal has been dealing with monsoon maladies for decades. Our healthcare system should proactively allocate human, infrastructural and budgetary resources to combat these monsoon epidemics and prevent unnecessary loss of life and a whole lot of suffering.  \nThe July 1 midnight deal between the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, the first and the second largest parties in the federal lower house respectively, turned national politics on its head. Pushpa Kamal Dahal was thrown out as prime minister and KP Oli assumed the country’s leadership. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asked Maoist Centre leader Ram Karki, who has cultivated an image of a rebel within the party, on his reading of the event. How do you see the CPN-UML’s rebuffing of the CPN (Maoist Centre) and formation of a new government with the Nepali Congress?If you see it from the perspective of those who believe in parliamentary democracy, this is wrong. In the system, the largest party is believed to have the public mandate to run the government and the second-biggest to be the main opposition. A weak opposition makes for a weak parliamentary system. The system isn’t an ideal one for us [communists]. The two parties have made a mockery of the system they advocate for. Why didn’t the Maoist party that championed progressive agendas implement them when in government?We should admit that we lost the moral authority to implement and execute those agendas. We could have implemented those ideals by mobilising peasants, working-class groups, and people from oppressed communities, but our grip and connection with them have loosened.Why did the party and the leadership distance itself from the working class?The state has two arms—coercive and persuasive. The Maoists succeeded in using coercive force. But you can’t use this all the time. One has to use persuasive force most of the time. When we joined mainstream politics, we were the leading political force. We were in power. At the time we should have changed our education sector. For that, we should have worked on our curriculum and trained teachers. Our educational system is guided by patriarchal and feudal values. We need to orient people to questioning and following science. The party couldn’t do so. Had we done so, we would now have a critical mass with us. The Maoist leaders lost the moral ground. When you preach lofty ideas, the public won’t listen to you. They instead watch your lifestyle. Earlier, the Congress and the UML leaders, who were outsiders in Kathmandu, got ‘polluted’ when they worked in collusion with the capital’s elites. We, too, got ‘polluted’ by hobnobbing with the two parties. The working class and oppressed communities that had helped the Maoist party fight the state felt betrayed. The leaders and the masses are separated now. The Maoist party was the true leader of the progressive agenda such as inclusion, federalism, secularism and republicanism. These ideas are still valid, but the party failed to honour them. It failed because it lost its strength and disconnected itself from the class it fought for. It tried to become the leader of all people. The oppressed communities felt betrayal, while the other classes didn’t accept the party because of our past. Do you think the Congress and the UML will try to undermine progressive agendas enshrined in the new constitution?They have also sold lofty ideas to the people in the past. A counter-revolution under the two parties’ leadership is not easy. Their rank and file won’t accept it. The Congress, in fact, is not only a political party but a collective where you find radical Hindus as well as hardcore secularists. It stays strong as long as it works as a unified force of various groups. But when it imitates communists and tries to be a rigid cadre-based party, it loses its space and strength. So the Congress can’t lead a counter-revolution against progressive ideas. Counter-revolution is not easy, but the reactionary forces have certainly succeeded in regaining their space.Observers and politicians from rival parties claim that the Maoist Centre is now in an existential crisis. Do you think it can make a comeback?More importantly, the space that used to be occupied by the Maoist party is now left unoccupied.Can’t the UML or other forces make inroads into that space?The UML is a tried and tested force. Even the Maoist Centre is now described as a tested force. How can older forces enter that space? A force mightier than the Maoists can emerge. As a Maoist party member, I still vow to rejuvenate and revive the Maoist Centre. I am trying to convince my fellow comrades to do that. But my voice hasn’t prevailed. I have been presenting my papers in the party’s general conventions. We still have a strong belief that sooner or later, we will prevail because we are raising valid issues.Various leftist groups have at various times tried to create a strong, united left political force in Nepal. Do you think ideas like socialism and communism still attract the youth?Some rebel voices within our parties take some initiatives to raise our collective voice to build pressure on party establishments. But this has been limited to theoretical debates and failed to translate into politics. A theory or philosophy is like an iron plate, while crafting a tool from that iron is politics. We haven’t been able to transform our ideas into political action. If a leader floats a political agenda, the people first study the leader’s integrity. If a leader with a strong moral authority proposes an idea, people trust and follow it. If Gandhi was wearing a suit and telling people to wear handwoven khadi, Indian people wouldn’t have followed him. Similarly, if Mao was using clothes, watches and vehicles from developed countries while preaching for simplicity, Chinese people wouldn’t have followed him.Our people don’t listen to our leaders because they don’t see the leaders walk the talk. Youths are always attracted by adventurism; they are receptive and sensitive to certain incidents. Now, they aren’t following us because they don’t find any adventure and newness in our ideas. If we do some soul searching and correct ourselves, the Maoist Centre still can lead the process to complete the unfinished progressive agendas. Is that possible under the current Maoist leadership that has lost its credibility while staying in power for long? Will the people trust them?People will judge them based on their actions. If the Maoist leaders were more credible, there would be no space for the Congress and UML to come together. Either one or the other force would seek the Maoist party’s support. They wouldn’t have dared to ignore the Maoist party that led progressive issues in the recent past. They were emboldened because of the Maoists’ diminishing influence. Therefore, we have to correct ourselves in practice.You said that the classes and communities the Maoist party used to lead now have no leader. Can new outfits occupy that space?The traditional parties—the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre–don’t have any strategic vision on where they want to see the country in 20 years. The new forces are worse. They hit a ball and wherever it reaches, shift the goalpost there. They carry the goalpost with them. New forces with such visions can’t replace old parties. History shows that Nepal has witnessed political upheavals in a gap of 10-15 years. In the past such tsunamis have changed the political systems. Now we have seen sparks of movements but they are scattered. New forces need an ideological weapon. The Maoists forgot to sharpen their ideological weapon over time by holding ideological debates and upgrading themselves. Another is intra-party democracy. A political party that doesn’t practise intra-party democracy can’t enforce democracy in society.From the perspectives of intra-party democracy, the Maoist Centre is probably the most undemocratic of major political forces. Why?In the Congress, you are free to speak, but you don’t have a say in execution. Communist parties are too centralised. The structure conceptualised around a century ago in the context of wars and other contexts hasn’t been updated. Even new parties are run by the party chiefs imitating the anomalies of traditional forces. A leader is praised if s/he takes immediate decisions, gets them endorsed from the party committees and implements them swiftly. Those who say they have to first discuss the issue in party committees are described as weak. Such a trend is killing intra-party democracy.Do you think the Congress-UML coalition will succeed?A coalition between the parties that don’t even have a common minimum programme is a coalition of opportunists. They don’t have a moral ground either. On ideological grounds, the Congress still cites the late BP Koirala because no other leader of the party has worked on the theoretical front for decades. Such is also the situation with communists. They still cite the theoretical works of the late Pushpa Lal Shrestha. The current alliance is not a principled one, it’s a collaboration between opportunists. So, don’t expect anything better.How do you evaluate the outgoing government?It did nothing for the class it represents. The prime minister’s secretariat might have prepared a list of ‘100 important achievements of the government’. But what is the government’s priority? It failed to even give skills to those going abroad in search of work. They would have found better work had we given them valuable skills. Not only the outgoing one but all the previous governments have failed. The Congress-UML alliance has said it wants to review the constitution and amend the charter when necessary. How do you see this idea?This will be backtracking from the present constitutional roadmap. It is dishonest to create hindrance in implementing the federal system and then suggest the system is a burden. Such moves would give space to those who want to raise questions on republic and secular systems. There is a strong faction that lobbies for Hindutwa in the Nepali Congress. It is no secret that the Congress and the UML were not in favour of republic, secular and federal systems. But later, they rode the popular wave. But they have still not internalised it, and there are some regressive elements in both the parties but the people, who have come too far, won’t backtrack.Don’t you think the coming together of Congress and UML may ensure political stability?Instability is okay for me because stability may not necessarily be good for a country like ours. See, a single leader has been ruling a party continuously for over 30 years. What if they rule the country in a similar way? Look at some countries where a single leader has ruled for decades. The current arrangement is better than such stability.Will the Maoist party chairman and prime minister, who didn’t even appoint a minister from a Dalit community, have the moral authority to again champion the agenda of the oppressed?Appointing a minister is again an ornamental approach to appease certain communities. What we should do is ensure the participation of oppressed communities in policymaking.But party chair Dahal may again seek ways to get back to power. Will he pay attention to these issues?We should stop this chase for power at all cost. We will say this in our party meetings. We should accept the reality that we have just 32 seats and so we won’t get sufficient space to implement any important programmes even if we join the government.The way your party chief remained in power for over 18 months using various tactics, was it right?If you see it through a parliamentarian’s lens, it looks quite smart. If you see it through a Marxist perspective, just becoming a prime minister is futile if you can’t implement your policies and strengthen republicanism and participatory democracy. \nThe Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML last week reached an agreement to form a coalition government under the leadership of UML chair KP Sharma Oli. As a part of the package, they also aim to make certain changes to the constitution. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asked Pradeep Gyawali, deputy general secretary of UML, the reasons behind the coming together of the two largest parties, how they plan to run the government and to review and amend the constitution.Many are seeing the Congress-UML alliance as something unusual. What factors brought the two largest parties together even as there is no crisis-like situation or a special task such as constitution writing?Definitely, in normal parliamentary practice, the two largest parties don’t forge an alliance to run a government. The party that gets the biggest mandate leads the government, and the other big party remains in the opposition to make the ruling force accountable. In Nepal, the country’s two major forces, the Congress and the UML, have also joined hands in certain junctures for certain purposes. They worked together to make the constitution in 1990, to conduct general elections in 1999, to complete transition after the 2006 people’s movement and to bring out the constitution in 2015. We felt a need for a similar collaboration this time around. After the November 2022 elections, we saw three alliances in our parliament. At first, Maoist Centre chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal became prime minister with our support, but he failed to abide by the agreement sincerely. He changed the coalition within a month. The subsequent alliance between the Congress and the Maoist Centre lasted for a year. He again sought the UML’s support. Within four months of the March 4 deal with the UML, he started yet another gameplan to join hands with the Congress under the pretext of forming a national consensus government. It was quite unusual for the prime minister himself to instigate instability in the government. He publicly boasted that he had a ‘magical number’ [32 seats in the House of Representatives]. He thought that he could employ the tactic of ‘use and throw’ with the two largest parties and rule the country for the full term. He was completely indifferent to people’s plight, the country’s pressing issues and service delivery. This was the height of irresponsibility. So, the UML and Congress leaders concluded that the time had come to intervene to ensure political stability and service delivery and make sure public frustration doesn’t get out of hand. Did external factors play a role? Recent statements by UML leaders suggest that the party has taken it seriously. When national forces are weak, the neighbouring countries and international forces become more cautious, even more so given Nepal’s geo-political situation. Some of their concerns are valid. They fear political instability in Nepal may have an adverse impact on their genuine issues. We have to take this naturally. Second, it is no secret that we have a long legacy of facing external interference. Sometimes such interventions are carried out covertly and sometimes overtly. Therefore, national forces should be strong. Some political parties and leaders have a tendency of seeking external forces’ support to fulfil their vested interests. In return, they serve the external forces’ undue interests. Formation of a government is a purely domestic affair, but in our case sometimes it also becomes an issue of geopolitical interest. It is said that the UML was spooked when it learned that Prime Minister Dahal had reportedly approached the Congress for a new alliance. This reportedly happened after Dahal returned from New Delhi following Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s swearing-in.We were taken by surprise when the Congress leaders told us that the prime minister had reached out to them with a proposal to form a national consensus government. We were informed about the development from the leaders of the main opposition party. When we reached the March 4 deal with the prime minister, we thought he came to us with a commitment to course correction. Based on that, we supported him almost unconditionally. We didn’t bargain while sharing ministerial portfolios and didn’t talk about the prime minister’s term. We had even thought of allowing Dahal to run the government for the full term if the government functioned well and people were satisfied. We hadn’t even imagined that we would have to think about changing the coalition within four months.We definitely had certain grievances such as a lack of consultation with our party and our lawmakers while preparing the government’s policies and programmes and while allocating budget. Our party chair brought up this issue with the prime minister. But our concerns weren’t addressed. They had already started to ignore us. There were several issues with the prime minister, but we were committed to the partnership. But they had already gone too far. Fortunately, the Congress leaders didn’t accept the offer and instead raised critical questions about the rationale behind the proposal. Basically, the Congress didn’t trust Prachanda ji [Dahal] and came to us. It concluded that Dahal didn’t come with the intent of solving the country’s problems but to manoeuvre between the Congress and the UML.Besides jointly running the government, constitution amendment is another major aspect of the latest Congress-UML deal. What are the provisions the parties want to change?There are four major objectives of this agreement. Safeguarding national interest; strengthening economy; improving governance and service delivery; and ensuring political stability. A debate has started that some constitutional provisions are not helping maintain political stability. What we have said is that it’s been almost a decade since the promulgation of this constitution. Some of its provisions are yet to be implemented. On the other hand, provincial governments complain that they have not been able to work in a full-fledged way because the federal government has still not made some laws they need. So, first, we will undertake a comprehensive review on the progress in the course of implementing the constitution and the challenges we faced in the past decade, among other things. While doing so, we will find out if there are provisions that have posed challenges in maintaining political stability and running a stable government and suggest amendments accordingly.So, it’s not only about the amendment but also about review, assessment and recommendation for amendment, if there is a need. Even if the amendment process begins, it will be limited to ensuring political stability and won’t touch other aspects of the statute. There is no need to over-react. For instance, some Maoist leaders are trying to make it a political issue by describing it as a regressive move. That is wrong.So as per the two-party deal, the statute will be reviewed but not necessarily amended?Yes, whether to go for amendments will depend on the findings of the review. No constitution in the world is perfect. Its success largely depends on the practitioners. So, first we have to differentiate between the role of the constitution and the practitioners. It is true that our society is divided over certain provisions of our constitution. All these issues will be considered, but the fundamental features of the constitution such as democracy, inclusion and federalism won’t be altered. Our priority would be to only remove hindrances in making the system more functional, people-oriented and productive.Of late, people are debating the electoral system, provincial structure and secularism. Will these issues also be dealt with?Federalism is a new system for us. In fact, it is still an in-the-making process in Nepal. We have to note some timelines while analysing the performance of provinces. After the provincial and federal elections in 2017, the first provincial governments were formed in 2018, and they worked for around three years in a stable way. With small cabinets, they worked genuinely to strengthen the provincial system. At the time, most provincial cabinets had around six to seven ministers. They weren’t severely criticised at the time. The wrong trends in the provinces started with the division of the then Nepal Communist Party and the fall of the NCP-led governments at the centre as well as provinces. We saw the trend of horse-trading in provinces. Small parties made unjustified bargaining for ministerial portfolios, chief ministers started splitting ministries and increasing the number of ministers in their cabinets. Also, the November 2022 polls again gave a fragmented verdict, further augmenting the instability and anomalies at the provincial level. So, the problem is the way we are handling things more than the provincial structures. The time isn’t ripe to seek an alternative to the provinces. As far as the electoral model is concerned, we included proportional electoral (PR) system after long debates and discussions. Based on three general elections held after 1990, a conclusion was drawn that the first-past-the-post (FPTP) model couldn’t properly represent the historically under-represented sections. The premise is still valid. Based on the achievements, we may exclude certain communities from the list. But that time hasn’t come. Two questions raised over the use of PR are valid. Is the system really doing justice to the strata and class of the society for which it was introduced? This is the question not about the PR system but the leaders who use it. Similarly, some questions: Is proportional representation required in executive as well because representation is basically vital for policy making? The forms and modalities of the PR system might be discussed, but no one has even thought of removing the inclusive system.Similar is the case with secularism. The spirit is to make the state patron of all religions in the country. However, some sections of society have often tried to misuse and misinterpret the new constitutional provision. They try to interpret secularism as openly allowing rampant religious conversion, and some have made it an excuse to attack the age-old Sanatan faith. For instance, if the President or prime minister visits Lumbini, gurudwara or a shrine of any other faith on certain occasions, that is taken positively, but when they visit Pashupatinath Temple, a section of people raise questions. These activities have made some people think that these attacks on our Sanatan faith are taking place because of the secular system. There is no problem in the constitutional provision because the statute added an explanatory note that states, “‘secular’ means religious, cultural freedoms, including protection of religion and culture handed down from time immemorial.” But some extremist activities have given wrong impressions.Some experts believe the problem of fragmented mandate can be addressed by increasing the threshold required for a political party to be eligible to get PR seats, which can be done by amending laws. Will the Congress-UML alliance opt for this?Yes, this is one feasible option. I am in favour of this. As per the existing provision, a political party can secure seats under the PR category by securing 3 percent votes in the federal parliament and 1.5 percent votes in provincial assemblies. If a political organisation doesn’t even represent 5 or 7 or 10 percent of the population, what can they contribute to the country? You do politics to represent a sizable population and get a public mandate. Otherwise, the presence of such groups would only promote unreasonable bargaining and instigate instability in governments. This can be one of the agenda of the discussion between the two parties.This time, leaders have made it transparent that chiefs of the two parties will lead the government on a rotational basis. But why have other details of the agreement not been made public?There hasn’t been topic-wise discussions on specific provisions. The broader understanding is to review and assess the implementation aspect of the constitution and move ahead based on the findings of the assessment. We have also made it clear that such an act will be guided only by the objective of ensuring political stability and we will not go beyond that. Who will undertake this type of constitution review?We haven’t worked on it in detail. We haven’t reached any understanding. Naturally, inputs will be taken from the constitution makers, experts on constitutional law and politicians involved in this field. But no decision has been made on its nitty-gritty.The Rastriya Prajatantra Party that wants to revive the Hindu kingdom was the first party to welcome the Congress-UML deal while the Maoist Centre has accused Congress and UML of making a regressive move. So don’t you think this affair is tricky?I don’t think the political parties will touch the issues that the RPP talks about, such as reinstatement of Hindu kingdom and dissolution of federalism. No one is thinking about that. Also, the questions raised by the Maoist leaders have no meaning. They are only trying to make a political agenda.It also seems that the Congress and the UML floated this idea of reviewing the constitution to make a case for the two largest parties to form the government.That’s not true. This question undermines the spirit of this agreement. If this system fails, people will raise questions mainly to the leaders of the Congress and the UML, not Prachanda. It’s not only about running the government. We were already in the government and it isn’t a big deal for the Congress to return to power. If democracy fails, the democratic forces will lose the most. So we are genuinely working on this. The Congress and the UML are historical rival forces in Nepali politics. How can the two work together in government?It is true that the Congress and the UML are the two major competitors of this country. But we have some converging factors. First, we both believe in a broader democratic framework. Sometimes, the Congress may give more emphasis on liberal values while we may push for more socialism-oriented programmes. But the common ground is democratic values. We also have the experience of successfully carrying out certain tasks jointly. We may have some friction but we also have experience of managing bitter intra-party fighting as well as inter-party rivalry.How will the ministerial portfolios be shared in the new coalition?We haven’t reached any agreement in detail. As we aim to make this a ‘national consensus government’ we are in favour of accommodating other parties. So it will depend on the number of parties that join the Cabinet. Our only concern is that ministerial allocations should be done in a way that doesn’t weaken the prime minister in order to ensure that the head of the government can deliver.How can a government without the Maoist Centre and some other parties be called a consensus government?We have to wait for that. Leaders of political parties that fiercely criticise the government also join the Cabinet under one or other pretext. Some political parties seemingly cannot exist without being in the government.  \nOver 52% of students failed the Secondary Education Examination due to poor teacher quality, outdated teaching methods, and inadequate preparation for the new letter grading system, which requires teachers to engage students actively and assess them throughout the learning process.\nRecent ambassadorial changes and diplomatic practices are being discussed in Nepal, including the recall of ambassadors, the benefits of PM Dahal's India visit, and the progress and challenges of BRI and trade agreements with China.\nThe government has made the National ID card mandatory for government and public institution services, aiming to replace multiple cards, enhance security, and control financial fraud.\nLight to moderate rain, thunderstorms, and lightning with heavy rainfall in some areas, generally cloudy weather across the country, with maximum temperatures reaching 36.4°C in Dhangadi and minimum temperatures around 15.5°C in Jomsom.\nCloudy weather with widespread light to heavy rainfall, accompanied by thunder and lightning, is forecast across the country, particularly in Koshi, Madhesh, Gandaki, Lumbini, and Bagmati provinces.\nPartly to generally cloudy weather with light to moderate rain, thunder, and lightning is expected in various provinces, with heavy rainfall in specific areas.\nThe weather today will be generally to mostly cloudy throughout the country.Koshi, Madhesh, Bagmai, Gandaki and Lumbini provinces are expected to experience heavy to very heavy rainfall at a few places heavy rainfall has also been forecast at one or two places in Karnali and Sudurpaschim provinces.Light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is likely to occur across the country.The weather is likely to remain the same until later tonight.Heavy rainfall may continue in Koshi, Madhesh and Gandaki provinces while light rainfall is likely to occur in some places of Bagmati province.Dipayal recorded a maximum temperature of 35.7 degrees Celsius on Thursday while Jomsom had a minimum temperature of 15.5 degrees Celsius. \n\nBe elaborative as possible.

Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nCPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli was sworn in as the prime minister of Nepal for the fourth time amid a function at the President’s Office in Sheetal Niwas on Monday. President Ramchandra Paudel administered the oath of office and secrecy to Prime Minister Oli. President Paudel on Sunday had appointed Oli as the prime minister under Article 76 (2) of the constitution as there were no other claimants for the post. After CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the immediate past prime minister, was unable to secure the trust of the House of Representatives during a floor test on Friday, President Paudel had invited political parties to form a new government under Article 76 (2) of the constitution on the same evening, setting a Sunday deadline for submitting claims at the President’s Office.With no other contender, Oli had in his support submitted the signatures of 166 lawmakers (Nepali Congress’ 88 and UML’s 78). The minimum number needed to form a government is 138 in the 275-strong House of Representatives.Soon after the swearing-in ceremony on Monday, Prime Minister Oli formed a full 22-member Cabinet, including two deputy prime ministers. Among the 22 members including the prime minister, 10 are from the Congress, while nine represent the UML. The other parties in the Cabinet are the Janata Samajabadi Party (JSP), led by Ashok Rai, and Loktantrik Samajbadi Party (LSP), which have two and one ministries, respectively. Shortly after Oli’s swearing-in, President Paudel also administered the oath of office and secrecy to the newly appointed ministers. Based on Article 76 (9) of the constitution, President Paudel, on the recommendation of the prime minister, administered the oath of office and secrecy to the ministers.Article 76 (9) stipulates that the President shall, on the recommendation of the prime minister, constitute the Council of Ministers comprising a maximum of 25 ministers, including the prime minister, in accordance with the inclusive principle from among the members of federal Parliament.Despite the Article based on which the prime minister recommended the ministers clearly stating that the council of ministers should be in line with the inclusive principle, that is not the case.In the 25-member council of ministers, Prime Minister Oli can still appoint three ministers.“The prime minister still can appoint three full Cabinet ministers or ministers of state to fulfil the requirement enshrined by the constitution for the council of ministers,” Purnaman Shakya, a professor of constitutional law, told the Post. “But ministers of state can only participate in Cabinet meetings in the absence of their line ministers.”In Monday’s Cabinet, Prakash Man Singh of the Congress and Bishnu Prasad Paudel of the UML were inducted as deputy prime ministers. They will also head the Ministry of Urban Development and the Ministry of Finance, respectively.In the 22-member Cabinet formed under Oli’s leadership, there are only two women. There is no representation from the Dalit and Muslim communities.In the 22-member Cabinet, 13 are from the Khas Arya community, and there are three members from Janajati and five from Madheshi communities.Nepal has incorporated proportional representation and inclusion as integral parts of the constitution. This was done to prevent the overrepresentation of one community at the policy-making level. But the country has failed to abide by its charter.“What an irony! Not a single Dalit get a berth in the new Cabinet formed by the so-called champions of inclusive democracy,” Lokraj Baral, a professor of political science, wrote on social media.Likewise, Bhimarjun Acharya, a constitutional expert, also questioned the new Cabinet's inclusiveness.“Everyone did a lot of politics in the name of Dalits, and the communists even more so. Dalits were not given any place in yesterday’s government led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal nor in today’s government led by Oli,” Acharya wrote on social media. “I request that Dalits be represented in the Council of Ministers immediately.” When the Post questioned Dalit members of the Congress and the UML parties, they said they were not the right people to comment on the issue.As per the National Population and Housing Census 2021, 13.2 percent of the national population are Dalits while Muslims comprise 4.86 percent of the population.Yet Dalit activists find fault with this silent approach. It is precisely because the Dalit politicians do not strongly raise the issue of their inclusion that this trend prevails, they say.“There are a few other reasons why Dalits are sidelined from mainstream politics. One is because of a weakened Dalit movement,” Purna Darnal, a Dalit activist, told the Post. “When the Maoist Centre, a political party that championed inclusiveness in Nepali politics, refused to be inclusive in the Cabinet formed in their leadership, why would other parties do so?”Darnal added that it is a matter of shame that the two biggest parties in the country practice such blatant exclusion while choosing ministers.Nine of the 10 ministers from the Congress are male. When dividing them into clusters, seven are Khas Arya, and one each are Janajati, Tharu and Madheshi.Likewise, eight of the nine ministers of UML are male. Six are from the Khas Arya community, two are Janajati, and one is a Madheshi. \nNewly appointed foreign minister Arzu Rana has said that boundary disputes should be resolved through facts and evidence, avoiding unnecessary conflicts with neighbouring countries.While taking charge of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Monday, Rana, the country’s fourth foreign minister, said unlike in the past, it is no longer necessary to take decisions on boundary issues solely based on the inspection of border pillars.“We will resolve the boundary dispute with India based on geography, history and new scientific maps prepared on the basis of the global positioning system [GPS]. We have more information, facts and evidence now than in the past, so there is no need to bicker over which boundary pillar was where,” Rana told reporters after assuming the office of foreign minister. “The facts are there, so we can resolve all our border issues,” she said. “As per my briefing, the Mahakali serves as a border river, and both countries [Nepal and India] have access to it, so there is always a dispute.” “This is a transboundary issue, which we must clearly understand. Hopefully, something will happen in our lifetime. Resolution to the problem will be found on the basis of geography, history and GPS. There’s no magic solution. As I said, we are in a delicate geopolitical location so must act very carefully. We have survived as a nation for a long time, and need to continue to do so, not just for today or tomorrow, but for thousands of years,” said Rana. Prior to Rana, three women, namely Bimala Rai Poudyal, Sujata Koirala, and Sahana Pradhan, had taken charge of the foreign ministry.Rana, the spouse of Nepali Congress chief and former prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, has worn several hats in the past, including experience in social fields and parliamentary affairs. Nepal has a longstanding boundary dispute with India, and ongoing issues with China. Due to the lack of joint inspection since 2006, officials do not have records of such disputes on the northern border.“Regarding Kalapani, Limpiyadhura and Lipulek, we can sit with India and reach a resolution,” said the foreign minister, who will face daunting foreign policy challenges in the rapidly changing geopolitical landscape. On the first day of her office, the minister was asked how she would address boundary issues with India. She said geopolitics is a complex issue, and she does not rely on magic to resolve such disputes.She described her new role as “historic” and said she would use the opportunity in a constructive way.Rana stressed the importance of preserving Nepal’s legacy of never being colonised. “Ours is a small, landlocked country situated between two giants, so we have to maintain balanced relations with all,” she added. “Our ancestors have protected our country throughout history. The legacy must be upheld for generations to come.” Rana also stated that she plans to focus on executing economic diplomacy and implementing international treaties, agreements and commitments. Also, she committed to secure the repatriation of Nepali youths serving in the Russian Army, and to initiating efforts for the safe release of Bipin Joshi, who is believed to be in Hamas captivity since October 7 last year. \nNandaram Mahar’s family of seven haven’t had a good night’s sleep for the past month or so. The family is currently living at a temporary shelter in Nalgad Municipality-4 of Jajarkot district. What was already an arduous stay got worse after the start of the monsoon—the temporary hut struggles to keep out even normal rain if it continues for some hours, Mahar says. And when it rains, the food grains and clothes get wet.Mahar’s family relocated to the hut after the November 3 earthquake damaged their home. So moving back to the home is not an option, Mahar says. “The earthquake has weakened the land around the village, so the fear of landslides keeps us awake at night,” he says. “Now that it has started raining heavily, we have no option but to stay awake all night.”Mahar’s is not the only family that has had to battle monsoon with very few resources. The government has identified a total of 48,517 families in need of rehabilitation in the 6.4 magnitude earthquake. As many as 34,954 temporary shelters have been constructed so far. The rest of the families are forced to stay either in the flimsy tarpaulin tents or staying in the old house damaged by the quake.Chief District Officer of Jajarkot Umakant Adhikari said that since June, the details of 24,557 families have been included in the disaster management protocol. According to him, after releasing the second tranche of the housing reconstruction aid to build temporary huts, the amount is being distributed through the respective ward offices.Similarly, the second tranche has been released to 16,000 earthquake displaced families in Rukum West. Chief District Officer of Rukum West Hari Prasad Pant said that Rs400 million was sent to the local level account as second instalment for the construction of temporary housing. According to him, 32,006 beneficiaries have been recorded throughout the district. He informed that an additional budget has been requested from the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority to provide funds to the rest.The earthquake victims complain that they are hugely affected by the monsoon rains. Lal Bahadur Mahar of Bheri Municipality-1 said that the clothes and food that gets wet when it rains have to be brought outside and dried when the sun shines. According to him, some families of the village risked their lives as they returned to the cracked houses. “The roof is constantly leaking,” he said. “It is very difficult to live here.”Many earthquake victims are taken ill in several settlements of earthquake affected districts of Jajarkot, Rukum West and Salyan. Children, senior citizens and patients of chronic diseases are the hardest hit. “Due to the intense heat and rain, the victims of the earthquake began to fall ill rapidly,” said Dr Priya Shahi of Basic Hospital in Chhedagadh. According to him, 50 to 100 patients come to the hospital daily for treatment of diarrhoea, fever, typhoid and pneumonia. He informed that almost 60 percent of those who come to the hospital are children.As per the record available at the district hospital in Jajarkot, around 150 people visit the health facility on a daily basis.The earthquake displaced people are exposed to monsoon-induced disasters. At present, most of the earthquake victims have built temporary housing near forests, riverbanks, edges of their farmland and on steep land. “Many of the quake-displaced families are at high risk of floods and landslides,” said Nar Bahadur Nepali, general secretary of Nepal Red Cross Society in Karnali Province. “The quake victims faced health problems during the cold winter and hot summer days. Now they are left at the risk of floods and landslides.”According to geologist Chandan Giri, there is a high risk of landslides in the areas affected by the earthquake. He said the risk of landslides is almost 80 percent higher after an earthquake than in other normal situations. After the earthquake, a team of five technicians led by him studied some villages in Nalgad, Bheri municipalities and Barekot Rural Municipality of Jajarkot and found that the land around various settlements was torn. “There is a risk of erosion and large landslides in those cracked areas,” he said, warning about the huge loss of lives and properties.The local people complained that the authorities concerned are indifferent about their hardships. However, Rabilal Sharma, secretary of Internal Affairs and Ministry of Law of Karnali Province, said that they have started preparation after studying the risk of landslides in the earthquake-affected settlements. According to him, all security mechanisms have been readied to minimise possible risks.16 families displaced due to the risk of landslidesAs the risk of landslides is looming large, 16 families of Chaupani in Bheri Municipality-1 have been displaced. The ward office has transferred 11 families to a nearby school, four families have moved to India while one family is taking shelter in a relative’s house, according to Deepak Rana, ward chair of Bheri Municipality-1.The district administration claims that it has carried out necessary initiatives to protect the quake-displaced people from the water-induced disasters. Adhikari, the Jajarkot CDO, said that a police team under the command of Assistant Sub-Inspector of Nepal Police has been mobilised to identify the families who are at high risk. “The families at risk are being searched and shifted to safer locations timely,” he added. \nChickens cannot fly far enough, but the price of eggs is flying through the roof.An egg now costs Rs22.50 in retail, up from Rs17 a year earlier, according to the poultry association. Nutritionists say this is not good news for consumers hit by inflation who tend to cut budgets for healthy diets due to low income.When eggs become expensive, it affects consumers in all brackets—from restaurants to bakeries and from canteens to households.In Nepal, millions of consumers rely heavily on eggs to meet their protein intake due to expensive meat.According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), humble eggs offer a practical and impactful opportunity to tackle problems related to undernutrition.Eggs are almost pure protein of very high quality. They also provide the entire Adequate Intake of vitamin B12 and choline for young children. The essential fatty acid content of eggs may be necessary in pregnancy. Eggs are popular in many countries and are available at affordable prices.“Most Nepalis have folic acid deficiency. The egg is one of the good sources of folate, including protein and vitamins, and is easy for people of any age to digest,” said Dr Sudhashree Adhikari, a nutritionist. “With a price hike, the egg will be out of reach for many people, which might cause protein deficiency. An egg fulfils around 10 grams of protein intake.”Growing children, including pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers, need more protein for growth and development. “The lack of protein hinders the growth and development of children, including muscle growth,” Adhikari said.A whole egg contains Vitamin A, Vitamin B9, Vitamin B5, Vitamin B12, Vitamin B2, Vitamin D, E, B6, minerals—phosphorus, selenium, calcium and zinc. Daily consumption of eggs might lower the risk of stroke. The antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin in eggs help prevent eye diseases like cataracts and age-related muscle degeneration. Choline in eggs is essential for pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers, as it helps the baby’s brain development.“A healthy adult can eat 1–2 eggs daily without hesitation. A whole egg contains almost all the nutrients a body needs,” Dr Atul Upadhyay, another nutritionist, told the Post in a recent interview.Recently, the retail price of eggs increased twice a month as the Nepal Layers Poultry Association hiked the farmer price, ultimately increasing the retail price.Binod Poharel, president of Nepal Layers Poultry Association, said the retail price of an egg is Rs22.50 now. Pokharel said that the price of eggs was increased as farmers could not recover the production cost for a long time due to the rise in feed prices. The farm gate price of an egg ranges from Rs14-16 per piece, but due to the multiple layers of middlemen, it becomes expensive when it reaches the consumer’s hand, traders said.FAO, the specialised agency of the United Nations that leads international efforts to defeat hunger, has set the per capita per year requirement of eggs in developing countries at 48 units. A person's requirement for meat, a source of protein, is 14 kg per year, while the requirement for milk is 91 litres.According to data from Nepal’s agriculture ministry, a Nepali eats 18.1 kg of meat and 61 eggs annually, well above the benchmark set by the UN body. The consumption of milk currently stands at 79 litres, still short by 12 litres.Per capita meat consumption was 9.8 kg per year in 2008 and 9.7 kg in 2000.Adhikari said that eggs are cheap and easy-to-find food that fulfils protein and vitamin needs better than plant-based proteins, different varieties of legumes, meat, and fish.Adhikari said the government needs to provide relief on such food products so that many people can access them. “When there is food inflation, and people’s incomes are not increasing, they will reduce their consumption.”According to the association, egg production this summer has declined to 2.5 million units daily from 6 million in 2023.“There is a gap between demand and supply as production gets hit in the summer season,” said Pokharel. “Also, many poultry farmers are leaving the industry after their businesses were hit badly by the Covid pandemic followed by high bank interest rates.”Consumer rights activists said traders hiked the price of eggs on the pretext that farmers kept a good profit margin for themselves. Prem Lal Maharjan, president of the National Consumer Forum, said poultry farmers do not benefit from the hiked price, as all the money goes into the pockets of traders or middlemen.Medium egg, which used to cost Rs430 per crate (30 pieces), now costs Rs530, a hike of Rs100 in a month.“This is not a justifiable hike. Traders are profiteering from it, not the farmers,” said Maharjan.Maharjan said that, earlier, two organisations fixed the price of eggs—the Egg Producers Association and the Nepal Layers Association. The price used to be competitive. “But now both organisations have merged. There is a monopoly,” he said, according to the Consumer Protection Act, 2018. The rise in egg prices is a big blow for consumers who have seen vegetable prices double and triple due to the monsoon disasters, which have affected output and cut the supply chain. Almost all seasonal vegetables have joined the Rs100 per kg club.    \nNepal national women’s cricket team defeated Sri Lanka Women Development Squad by two runs in their third T20 practice match in Surrey Village in Maggona on Tuesday.Indu Barma’s team bundled out Sri Lanka Women Development Squad, who were chasing 113, for 110 in 19.5 overs, with Kabita Joshi taking 3-16 and Kritika Marasini returning the match figures of 2-16.The win also prevented the host team from sweeping the three-match series. Nepal had lost the first T20 warm up game by 33 runs and the second by four wickets.Balasuriya top scored for Sri Lanka Development Squad with 38 runs off 36 balls, while Nethranjali made 26 facing 20 deliveries. Sri Lanka collapsed early when Kabita Kunwar trapped opener Karindi leg in front in the third over and Chhetri ran out Wijesinghe in the fourth over. Balasuriya steadied the ship, and with support from Nethranjali, the host team looked destined for another victory.But once Joshi dismissed Balasuriya in the 16th over and Nethranjali in the 18th, the Lankans’ hopes of completing a clean sweep faded.Skipper Barma also took a wicket.Earlier, Nepal posted 112-6 from 20 overs after choosing to bat first, thanks to Rubina Chhetri who revived Nepal’s innings after suddenly collapsing in the eighth over.Samjhana Khadka (10 off 20) and Sita Rana Magar (15 off 23) added 31 runs for the opening wicket to give Nepal a good start. Nepal found themselves in big trouble at 33-3 when they lost three quick wickets, including both openers, to Thennakone (2-21) in the eighth over.Bindu Rawal and Barma offered some resistance but the skipper too fell in the 13th over that left Nepal reeling at 52-4.But Chhetri partnered with Rawal to defy the Sri Lankan bowlers and guided Nepal past 100. Chhetri hit 37 runs off 26 balls, while Rawal contributed 20 off 31 balls.The victory will be a huge boost for Nepal ahead of their ACC Women’s T20 Asia Cup, which is set to begin on July 19.Nepal have been drawn in a tough group alongside the tournament’s most successful side and defending champions India, two-time runners up Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates.Nepal, who are still looking to register their first win at the biennial competition, will open their Asia Cup against the United Arab Emirates on Friday. They face Pakistan on July 21 and India on July 23.Nepal are making their third appearance at the Asia Cup. \nThe National Examinations Board (NEB) has announced that the Grade 12 results will be published by the end of July.Jung Bahadur Aryal, secretary of the NEB, said preparations are underway to publish the results soon.“Our goal is to release the results by the end of July, and it’s possible it could happen sooner,” he said. The board said it has received answer sheets from across the country and is currently engaged in the process of tallying marks and entering them in the system.A total of 390,847 students, including 196,914 females and 193,933 males, from 5,542 schools sat for this year’s exams held from April 26 to May 8. There were 1,526 designated exam centres, including one in Japan. This year, for the first time, the NEB used an automatic selection system to determine the examination centres in Kathmandu. \nLocal authorities are coordinating with officials from bordering Indian districts to recover the bodies of those missing in the Simaltal accident, where a landslide swept two buses into the Trishuli River last Friday.The search is being conducted in coordination with authorities of the Indian states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar after some bodies of the missing persons were found on Narayani riverbanks near the Indian border.Nepali authorities believe the flooded river might have taken the bodies to India.Chief District Officer (CDO) of Chitwan Indradev Yadav said they are coordinating with the district magistrates of Maharajgunj in Uttar Pradesh and West Champaran in Bihar. Both magistrates have been requested to inform Nepali authorities if they find any bodies in the river, but no bodies have been located yet.Although the CDO has the authority to coordinate with the bordering Indian districts, formal communication must go through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.Meanwhile, rescuers have deployed sonar cameras to search for the missing people and the wreckage of the two buses. These cameras can help the rescue teams in locating the buses and the victims underwater. A technical team, including engineers from the Armed Police Force Headquarters, has arrived at the incident site to search for the missing people.According to the Superintendent of Police Janak Puri at the Disaster Management Training School at Kurintar, they deployed new high-tech cameras on Monday.SP Puri said the new cameras can fetch data and capture pictures from depths up to 300 metres.“The sonar cameras used earlier could only detect whether there was an object in the water. But the current cameras provide detailed shape of the object and are effective even in murky conditions,” he said.However, operating the motorboat is difficult when the water current is very strong, he said, adding that they would search as far as Golaghat, 50 km downstream from the incident site.The rescue team searched for two kilometres downstream on Monday, but could not locate anything.APF Sub Inspector Ramesh Bahadur Thapa, who has spent 12 years as a rescue diver in Kurintar, has been tirelessly searching for the missing passengers and buses.“We don’t have a problem with the depth of the river. However, since the water is very murky, visibility is almost zero. With such strong water currents, the risk is also heightened,” said Thapa. He said that despite these challenges, the divers are giving continuity to their search.According to Chitwan CDO Yadav, 12 divers from the Armed Police Force and five from the Nepal Army have been deployed for the search.So far, 17 bodies have been found in different places and the identities of 10 bodies have been ascertained.A task force formed by the Ministry of Home Affairs on Monday is scheduled to visit the accident site on Wednesday.Sixty-two people went missing after two passenger buses were swept away by a mudslide into the rain-swollen Trishuli River near Simaltal along the Narayanghat-Mugling road section at around 3:30am on Friday. \nNepal is not even halfway through this monsoon, and the rain has already brought deadly floods and landslides. As per official records, from June 10 to July 14, a total of 108 people have died, many more have been injured, and 3,552 families have been displaced across the country. The death toll is likely to mount as more bodies surface from the recent tragic Simaltal incident on the Mugling-Narayanghat road section (also called Madan Ashrit Highway), where a landslide swept two buses carrying 65 people into Trishuli River last week. It is unfortunate that our efforts to prevent human loss have been far from satisfactory. Constant politicking, lack of preparedness and a culture of dismissing expert research and suggestions on road construction all make monsoons a perfect storm of disasters. Take the Mugling-Narayanghat road. The road was widened without factoring in its geographical vulnerability and landslide risks, and the landslides there have only gotten worse in the past few years. Moreover, haphazard roads built above the major roads throughout the country have put many lives in danger, as happened during the Simaltal incident. As per a Setopati report, the debris flow brought about by the road construction in the settlements above the Simaltal area reportedly resulted in the incident.Geologists have consistently raised concerns about the risks associated with the highway; however, their words have fallen on deaf ears. In June of this year, the landslide risk assessment flagged 11 areas on the highway as zones that needed immediate study and 25 areas as prone to landslides. Similarly, according to Kaski district’s Disaster Response Plan (as reported by Himalkhabar), 25 settlements are in danger of flood and landslide in Pokhara Metropolitan City. As a part of their disaster preparedness, each district is mandated to prepare a disaster response plan. Despite this, when the time comes to act, they lack the necessary human resources, equipment, or budgetary support to prevent disasters and rescue people. We don’t have to look far to see how the country’s disaster preparedness has failed—Simaltal has received major attention in terms of rescue yet, as of now, neither the buses that were swept away nor most of those missing have been found. When it comes to dealing with disasters, our authorities have always adopted a wait-and-see approach. The Home Ministry, responsible for overseeing national disaster preparedness, issued a notice on preventive measures, including suspending the plying of vehicles at night in high-risk areas, only after the tragic incident on the Mugling-Narayanghat highway. These measures could still prove beneficial, but we need a long-term solution and pre-planning. As local governments are still ill-prepared to handle pre-disaster preparedness as well as post-disaster rescue efforts, it is up to the federal government to equip the community level bodies with enough budget and equipment. We have had enough of these life-threatening disasters. Even though it is already late, all three levels of government must heed the experts, engineers and geologists when constructing or widening roads. The much-needed slope stabilisation through bio-engineering should be done on the Mugling-Narayanghat highway and other risky paths without further delay. The governments should also prioritise rigorous monitoring and follow-ups on road construction. We cannot afford to lose any more lives to these disasters. \nThe first edition of the Nepal Living Standards Survey (NLSS-I) 1995-96 aimed to create “unique opportunities to assess the poverty situation in the country and carry out many other research works by providing a large database at a single reference point.” Simultaneously, the survey operation aimed to contribute to the capacity building of the then Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) in conducting sample surveys. In a sense, it was an experimentation and training opportunity created for the next generation of sample survey researchers. This, therefore, had obvious caveats on the robustness of its outcomes and usability of inferences.Last month, the National Statistical Office (NSO), the rebaptised CBS, published a report of the fourth edition of the Survey (NLSS-IV) 2023-24. The original objective of the NLSS to “assess the poverty situation” does not seem to have changed. However, in nearly three decades of exercises that published three editions—1996, 2004 and 2011—this government entity seems to have barely learned to conduct such sample-based surveys, improve its inferential credibility, and maintain research integrity while working with a disproportionately small sample of a large population.Unrepresentative samplingNo doubt, sample surveys, as against population surveys, are risky and can provide only indicative inference even if they are implemented with utmost professionalism and high precision research. Otherwise, they suffer from self-selection bias and inferential misrepresentation due to underrepresentation of data variation. Besides, creating a mini sample from an already available population dataset to inquire into the topic that the population sample itself could carry out better is a redundant exercise and a misuse of resources. First, the NLSS rituals on top of the National Census do not add any value to better understanding the country's socioeconomic realities. Second, the authenticity of small-sized sample surveys like the NLLS can be established if, and only if, their statistical outcomes are consistent with those of comprehensive surveys like censuses. The NLSS exercises have failed on both counts.For the NLSS-IV, data was collected from a sample of 9,600 out of 6.761 million households, or 0.14 percent. When it is disaggregated into selected 15 geographical domains, the average number of households surveyed in each domain is only 640. This is certainly a gross underrepresentation to statistically infer anything meaningful. For example, the NLSS-IV claims the proportion of households in Nepal receiving remittance income has reached 76.8 percent. It also argues that it is a dramatic increase from 23.4 percent in 1996 and 56.8 percent in 2011. Nevertheless, it is not only inconsistent with the National Census 2021 data but also does not reflect the actual ground reality. Inferential flawsThe Census 2021 states that the total number of individuals absent from home, possibly to be in a foreign country, is only 2.169 million. It is next to impossible to receive remittances by 5.192 million (76.8 percent of 6.761 million households recognised by the Census) households sent by only 2.169 million migrating individuals, including seasonal absentees. Among them, even if only one individual from each household is considered out of home and remits the earnings back, only 32 percent of the households are likely to receive any kind of remittance. The direct positive correlation between the outmigration of individuals and remittance income can no way be undermined or ruled out.There were similar inconsistencies in NLSS-2011 and Census-2011. The Census stated that the population away from the country then was only 1.921 million, while the NLSS-III claimed that nearly 57 percent of the 5.7 million households benefitted from the remittance receipts. As such, which inferences and conclusions should people believe in and use—the Census or the NLSS, both published by the same agency? There seems to be a great deal of confusion even in defining what essentially constitutes the 'remittance' for the purpose of this report.Even in determining the poverty line and poverty-related indicators—the sole stated objective of the NLSS exercise—both the data and inferences are messy, to say the least. It has adopted a new poverty line using 2022/23 as the base year. The updated line marginally increases the minimum income bar. A Nepali citizen is now classified as poor if her annual per capita total consumption expenditure is less than NRs72,908 annually, or Rs200 (USD 1.5 at 1 USD=NPR 133) per day. The report, at one instance, claims that Nepal has seen a significant reduction in poverty headcount over the last 12 years, from 25.16 percent in 2010-11 to 3.57 percent (vis-a-vis 2011 inflation-adjusted poverty line) in 2022-23. In the next paragraph, it says, “20.27 percent of the population in Nepal lives below the new poverty line”.The definitional relation in practice between the 'headcount' and the 'poverty line' is that the 'national poverty headcount ratio is the percentage of the population living below the national poverty line.' Then how do the claims that poverty declined to 3.57 percent while 20.27 percent of the population still languish below the poverty line by earning only USD 1.5 dollars a day stand together? Regardless of these purely data doctoring or data cooking machinations, the critical question is: Whether the poverty rate actually declined in reality or not.Extrapolations and excusesThese are only a few examples of research by a government agency that is dependent on a small set of data while resources are disproportionately used in clever tabulation and preparation of politically convenient reports to show progress in critical topics like poverty reduction. No research finding should be only a circus of data overexploitation and far-fetched extrapolation like this. Whenever the discrepancies in research outcomes of government agencies are called out, the instant response is to point fingers towards methodological differences or biased perceptions. Also, the “we are the government” mindset runs deep to prove their findings as sacrosanct and beyond question.Nepal is pathetically handicapped in data-based research. There is a clear dearth of institutions in the country, academic or otherwise, that have the technical capacity and financial resources to carry out large-scale, nationwide research to counter the spuriousness of many such government surveys and research outcomes. International development partners, for instance, the World Bank, which has been supporting the NLSS endeavours since the beginning in 1995, have hardly paid any attention to the fact that the effective presence of autonomous research institutions out of government influence can better contribute to national policymaking. A plethora of survey-based research norms and practices, specifically in government-owned agencies, must change now. \nA recent study report on the Nepali media landscape by the International Research & Exchanges Board (IREX), an American nonprofit, describes our media as “somewhat vibrant”. I haven’t been able to locate their full report on their site yet, but I find the phrasing for the overall score rather intriguing—Nepali media is vibrant but not as vibrant. Nepal scored 23 out of 40 overall for the four measures: Information quality, channels, consumption and engagement, and transformative action.I checked for how they define the term somewhat vibrant, with a score of 21 to 30, and this is what I found: “Quality information is available in this country and most of it is editorially independent, based on facts, and not intended to harm. There are sufficient resources for content production, but some groups may not be well-represented, and some media may struggle financially. Most people have the rights, means, and capacity to access a wide range of information, although some do not. Most people recognize and reject misinformation, although some do not…”The positive terms above, including international media headlines describing Nepal’s performance as satisfactory, might surprise average media users who generally criticise our media as failures lacking quality and breath. These words also contrast with the negative perception, and, to be precise, they suggest a \"mostly vibrant\" rather than a \"somewhat vibrant\" media environment.Over the years, I have described our media as vibrant, even \"very vibrant\", mainly for their assertiveness and persistence despite many challenges. The USAID-funded study essentially serves as a barometer to guide US development efforts in the country. It comes as a critique highlighting geographic disparity, caste-based leadership and a predominance of political coverage over crucial developmental issues such as inclusion and climate change in our media. What is particularly interesting and valuable about the report is that it integrates perceptions of editors and professionals from across the entire information ecosystem, including news and other forms of media.Quality issueDespite widespread perceptions, instances of Nepali media lapses are sporadic and occur as exceptions rather than the rule. Still, these issues are serious for hard-core journalism, if not for social media sites with varied media ethics or lax professionalism. They serve as a test of the civic significance of news media. At this juncture, journalism and social media alike face the dual challenge of innovating while maintaining the highest level of quality and integrity. News outlets, including traditional ones, have explored innovations in multimedia, podcasting and interactive visuals, but social media platforms lead in innovation. Traditional outlets still prioritise textual storytelling, and some shine in their long-forms and commentaries. Legacy media and online news portals are generally reluctant to innovate substantially, with multimedia efforts often failing to fully realise their potential. They are hindered by the need to \"feed the beast\"—meeting deadlines and sustaining portals with breaking news or live reports without much context.Enhanced diversity in content and inclusive coverage are critical needs. News platforms, generally known for their rigorous and verified reporting, should move beyond their predominant focus on social and political dramas to prioritise in-depth and comprehensive stories. Independent social media creators, known for their emphasis on sensational and controversial content but proficient in live reporting and specialising in niche subjects such as travel or educational vlogging, should strive to provide greater contextual depth. YouTubers and Facebook Live broadcasters have become significant players in our information ecosystem, impacting people’s perception of journalism itself. Podcasting and talk shows are on the rise but often lack the editorial oversight, news values and ethical guidelines necessary to be considered legitimate journalism. While they may exhibit some attributes of journalism—such as news portals, screaming headlines, and emphasis on currency—their authenticity is frequently questioned. Specific content from these sites is often criticised for unverified information, misleading narratives, and even misinformation. This issue, however, is not unique to Nepal.Understanding audience behaviour through ongoing research is also crucial. Are our audiences genuinely segmented, gravitating towards specific content types, or are they merely hopping around different content without much loyalty? Legacy media could attract more audiences through self-help, utility, or explainer journalism, but their mainstay remains news and current affairs.Overall, today, we have more journalism, both quantitatively and qualitatively, than in the past. However, compared to other forms of media content like entertainment, advertisement, publicity, and propaganda, journalism remains a small fraction. Perceptions of trust in media are often shaped by public misunderstanding of journalism's civic role amidst the increasing degradation of information in the digital age. The belief that anyone with digital access can perform journalistic tasks like content creation overlooks the meticulous methods and verification standards true journalists adhere to. In contrast, amateur content creators routinely rely on incomplete information. Nepali media must encourage creativity and uphold professional standards to foster true innovation. Simply focusing on content is insufficient. There is a notable deficiency in professional, technical, and managerial skills, especially in social marketing for engagement. Media outlets should invest in and cultivate dedicated storytelling teams. Training for journalists should go beyond news production to encompass new media skills and technical proficiency in design, engineering, production, audience engagement, verification and fact-checking. Competence in content marketing and management is equally crucial.The most discerning audiences still and often find legacy media more credible than other sources. The real issue lies in legacy media losing paid subscriptions, ad venues, and sponsorships to social media platforms. This shift has resulted in newsrooms being downsized, leaving novice reporters with little investment in innovation and training. The entire industry seems to be in disarray, and the market has lost its self-correcting powers.A systemic approach is required to bounce back, including policy reforms and partnerships with new media platforms. Journalism, as a public interest enterprise, is too precious to be left entirely to the market. The future of Nepali media hinges on its ability to innovate, diversify, and maintain the trust and engagement of its audience. \nKP Sharma Oli begins his fourth term as prime minister with a bit of baggage. Most infamously, during his third term, when the time came to hand over his prime ministership to his coalition partner as earlier agreed, Oli chose to dissolve the House of Representatives—twice—rather than voluntarily give up power. Thankfully, the Supreme Court stepped in to avert an untimely election. Rightly or not, Oli has over the years built a reputation for wheeling and dealing and for surrounding himself with yes-men. He is not someone comfortable reaching across the aisle. In fact, his stubborn and acerbic nature has made it easy for others, including his coalition partners during previous terms, to take offence. At 72 and in iffy health, Oli is also seen as someone whose time in Nepali politics has come and gone. On the external front, too, challenges galore. In recent times, ‘China’s man in Nepal’, as dubbed by the Indian media, has had a difficult relationship with New Delhi. Of course, he must be lauded for taking a dogged stand against the 2015-16 Indian blockade. But then Oli started spouting all kinds of nonsense like claiming that Lord Ram was born in Thori of Nepal rather than Ayodhya of India, unnecessarily needling the powerful BJP establishment. These are big hurdles no doubt. But they are not insurmountable. During the latest negotiations with Congress leaders, for instance, he is reported to have assured them that he has ‘matured’ and will refrain from taking juvenile steps like dissolving the House on a whim. He is also someone strongly wedded to the idea of a two-party polity, a strategy that suits many in the Congress just fine. (Whether it suits the country is a different thing.) As the agreement between the two big parties in the lead up to the formation of the new government is yet to be made public, it is hard to make definite predictions. Yet if Oli can channel his strong character to use the over two-thirds majority in the House for productive purposes, he can get a lot done. On India too, Oli was for long known as someone with personal rapport with top Indian leaders—and he still has the confidence and capacity to take personal initiative to mend fences. Disliked in Delhi and mistrusted in Beijing, Oli nonetheless will have his task cut out maintaining an increasingly difficult balance between the two neighbours.The priority for the new Oli government, just like it was for its predecessors, will be to breathe some life into a stagnant economy. A message of political stability given through a two-thirds majority will help. Yet both in and outside the country, there is a justified suspicion over the longevity of this ‘unnatural’ Congress-Communist coalition. Oli as prime minister must be ready to make some tough personal adjustments in order to stop the cycle of instability in government. This means not just reining in his natural tendency to rebuff critics and rely on a small coterie on all vital matters but reaching out to coalition partners and even the opposition parties as often as he can. In fact, if Oli tries to go it alone, before long this coalition too will implode. Whether while trying to revise the constitution, making important appointments, or crafting a budget, his government must be seen to be striving to engage the widest section of relevant stakeholders. The onus is on Oli to prove his critics wrong.  \nPresident Ramchandra Paudel on Tuesday authenticated three bills endorsed by both houses of the Federal Parliament.The bills authenticated by the President include the Finance Bill 2024, the Bill to Raise National Debt, 2024 and the Customs Tariff Bill, 2024. The Office of the President said in a statement that the President authenticated the bills in accordance with Article 113 (2) of the constitution. \nIndian Ambassador to Nepal Naveen Srivastava paid a courtesy call on Minister for Foreign Affairs Arzu Rana Deuba at her office at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Singha Durbar on Tuesday.The foreign ministry said in a post on X that various matters relating to Nepal-India relations and cooperation were discussed on the occasion.Rana assumed her office on Monday. While taking charge of the office, Rana said that boundary disputes should be resolved based on facts and evidence, avoiding unnecessary conflicts with neighbouring countries. \nPresident Paudel accepts Attorney General Pokharel's resignation following government change, per tradition; resignation sparked controversy over a letter regarding a cooperative fraud case.\nGareth Southgate resigned as England manager after losing 2-1 to Spain in the Euro 2024 final, ending his reign with an impressive knockout record but also two heartbreaking final defeats.\nIsraeli forces battled Hamas-led fighters in several areas across Gaza on Tuesday, while Palestinian health officials said at least 13 people were killed in Israeli bombardments in southern and central areas of the enclave.In Rafah, a southern border city where Israeli forces have been operating since May, five Palestinians were killed in an air strike on a house, while in nearby Khan Younis, a man, his wife and two children were killed, they said.In central Gaza in Nuseirat, one of the enclave’s eight historic refugee camps, at least four Palestinians were killed in separate shelling and aerial strikes, medics said. Israeli tanks bombed the southern sector of Gaza City earlier on Tuesday, residents said.The Israeli military said troops continued “intelligence-based” activities in Rafah, killing many Palestinian gunmen over the past 24 hours. It said air strikes had targeted militants, tunnels, and other Hamas military infrastructure.It added that the Israeli air force had struck around 40 targets across the enclave, including sniping and observation posts, military structures, and buildings rigged with explosives.The armed wings of Hamas and the Islamic Jihad said in separate statements their fighters attacked Israeli forces in several locations with anti-tank rockets and mortar fire.Israel has vowed to eradicate Hamas after its militants carried out the worst attack in Israel’s history on Oct. 7, killing 120 and taking more than 250 hostages, by Israeli tallies.In the nine-month war, more than 38,000 Palestinians have been killed in the enclave, according to Gaza’s health authority, which doesn’t distinguish between combatant and non-combatant casualties, although officials say most of the dead were civilian.Israel says it has lost 326 soldiers in Gaza and says at least a third of the Palestinian fatalities are fighters.Efforts mediated by Egypt and Qatar to end the conflict and release the hostages, as well as Palestinians in Israeli jails, had appeared to be making some progress, negotiators had said.TALKS PAUSEDHowever, the talks stalled on Saturday after three days of intense negotiations failed to produce a viable outcome, Egyptian security sources said, and after an Israeli strike targeting Hamas’ top military chief, Mohammed Deif. The attack in the Khan Younis area killed more than 90 people and wounded hundreds of others, health authorities in Gaza said.A Palestinian official close to the talks told Reuters on Tuesday that Hamas was keen not to be seen as halting the talks despite the stepped-up Israeli attacks.“Hamas wants the war to end, not at any price. It says it has shown the flexibility needed and is pushing the mediators to get Israel to reciprocate,” the official, who asked not to be named said.He said Hamas believes Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was trying to avoid a deal by adding more conditions that restrict the return of the displaced to northern Gaza and to maintain control over Rafah borders with Egypt, conditions that would not be acceptable to the group.US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said on Monday that two senior advisers to Netanyahu said Israel is still committed to reaching a ceasefire.Citing a report by the United Nations Environment Programme, the UN Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA said in a post on X it would take 15 years to clear around 40 million tons of war rubble in Gaza. The effort would need 100+ trucks and cost over $500 million. \nRwandans lined up on Monday to elect their next president, with early results putting incumbent Paul Kagame in the lead in a vote widely expected to give him a fourth term and extend his near quarter century in charge of the East African country.The two men standing against him - Frank Habineza from the Democratic Green Party and independent Philippe Mpayimana - said they were hoping to make some progress, but analysts and rights groups said Kagame’s overwhelming victory was all but certain.Kagame, who got more than 93% of the vote at the last three elections, won praise from Western and regional leaders at the time for helping end the 1994 genocide in Rwanda. The US State Department and others have also lauded the development of the economy.Rwandans are also voting on Monday for members of the lower house of parliament and provisional results are expected by July 20. Polling stations were open until 3 PM.The overall voter turnout was 98% of the 9 million registered voters, Oda Gasinzigwa, chair of the National Electoral Commission, said in a statement on the national broadcaster later on Monday evening.Of 78.94% of the votes counted at about 2017 GMT, Kagame was ahead with 99.15% of the votes, data from the commission showed.Campaign groups, including Human Rights Watch, have accused authorities of cracking down on journalists, the opposition and civil society groups before the vote. Kagame has dismissed such accusations and described himself as the stable candidate.His reelection could signal a measure of political stability for his corner of a fractured region, but also continued global scrutiny, given the accusations of abuses and of supporting rebels in neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo - a charge he has also denied.Earlier on Monday, at the Rwandexco polling centre in the capital Kigali, Barimukije Pheneas said he would vote for the 66-year-old incumbent.“We voted smoothly without any crowding, and we are happy,” Pheneas said.“I voted for Paul Kagame because he has achieved a lot for us; he united us.”Motorcycle taxi driver Karangwa Vedaste said the voting process was calm and peaceful, but declined to say who he had chosen.“I voted for a leader I trust. The one I voted for is a secret in my heart. We will share it when he wins,” Vedaste said.The electoral commission barred eight other candidates, including Kagame’s most vocal critics, from running, citing a range of reasons including missing and incomplete registration documents.Democratic Green Party candidate Habineza, whose deputy was found dead and almost beheaded in the run-up to the 2010 vote, said there had been signs of progress.“We toured the entire country, and wherever we went, people welcomed us warmly. They gave us gifts and assured us they would vote for us,” Habineza said after voting.“We have to maintain this momentum and not regress,” he added.“We are confident, each of us is confident, it’s half and half,” independent presidential candidate Mpayimana told journalists after casting his vote.The US State Department says on its website Rwanda has made “progress in developing national and local government institutions, economic development, maintaining security (and) promoting reconciliation”.It also says it backs Rwanda efforts to “increase democratic participation (and) enhance respect for civil and political rights”. \nScattered thunderstorms and heavy rainfall are expected in various regions of Nepal on Tuesday and tonight.\nEight years ago, in the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election, JD Vance was a bitter critic of Donald Trump.Publicly, he called the Republican presidential candidate an “idiot” and said he was “reprehensible.” Privately, he compared him to Adolf Hitler.But by the time the former president tapped Vance to be his running mate on Monday, the Ohio native had become one of Trump’s most ardent defenders, standing by his side even when other high-profile Republicans declined to do so.James David Vance’s transformation—from self-described “never Trumper” to stalwart loyalist—makes him a relatively unusual figure in Trump’s inner circle.Democrats and even some Republicans have questioned whether Vance, who wrote a bestselling memoir “Hillbilly Elegy” and is now a US senator from Ohio, is driven more by opportunism than ideology.But Trump, who survived an assassination attempt at a Pennsylvania campaign rally on Saturday, and many of his advisers see his transformation as genuine.They point out that Vance’s political beliefs—which mix isolationism with economic populism—dovetail with those of Trump, and put both men at odds with the old guard of the Republican Party, where foreign policy hawks and free market evangelists still hold sway.Republican Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, whom Vance has described as a mentor, told Reuters that Vance shifted his views on Trump because “he saw the successes that President Trump as president brought to the country.”In particular, Vance’s vocal opposition to US aid for Ukraine in its war with Russia has delighted Trump’s most conservative allies, even as it has upset some Senate colleagues.“He understands what Trump is running on and, unlike the rest of the Republican Party in Washington, agrees with it,” conservative commentator Tucker Carlson, a vocal Vance supporter, told Reuters.Vance, 39, was born into an impoverished home in southern Ohio. His pick may help boost the Trump campaign’s Rust Belt bona fides in a race that will be determined by voters in a handful of battleground states, including nearby Pennsylvania and Michigan, though his conservative views may be a turn-off for moderate voters.“To the extent that he can do anything for the ticket, it would be to recapture being the voice of the American dream,” said David Niven, an associate professor of politics at the University of Cincinnati who has worked as a speechwriter for two Democratic governors, referring to Vance’s rise from poverty to US senator and vice presidential candidate.After serving in the Marine Corps, attending Yale Law School and working as a venture capitalist in San Francisco, Vance rose to national prominence thanks to his 2016 book “Hillbilly Elegy.” In that memoir, he explored the socioeconomic problems confronting his hometown and attempted to explain Trump’s popularity among impoverished white Americans to readers.He was harshly critical of Trump, both publicly and privately, in 2016 and during the opening stages of his 2017-2021 term.“I go back and forth between thinking Trump is a cynical asshole like Nixon who wouldn’t be that bad (and might even prove useful) or that he’s America’s Hitler,” he wrote privately to an associate on Facebook in 2016.When his Hitler comment was first reported, in 2022, a spokesperson did not dispute it, but said it no longer represented Vance’s views.By the time Vance ran for Senate in 2022, his demonstrations of loyalty—which included downplaying the January 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol by Trump’s supporters—were sufficient to score the former president’s coveted endorsement. Trump’s support helped put him over the top in a competitive primary.In media interviews, Vance has said there was no “Eureka” moment that changed his views on Trump. Rather, he gradually realised that his opposition to the former president was rooted in style rather than substance.For instance, he agreed with Trump’s contentions that free trade had hollowed out middle America by crushing domestic manufacturing and that the nation’s leaders were too quick to get involved in foreign wars.“I allowed myself to focus so much on the stylistic element of Trump that I completely ignored the way in which he substantively was offering something very different on foreign policy, on trade, on immigration,” Vance told the New York Times in June.In the same interview, Vance said that he met Trump in 2021 and that the two grew closer during his Senate campaign.Vance declined to be interviewed by Reuters for this article and his spokesperson declined to comment for it.The Ohio senator’s detractors see his shift in views as a cynical ploy to ascend the ranks of Republican politics.“What you see is some really profound opportunism,” said Niven, the politics professor.One issue where his position appears to have converged with Trump is abortion.Vance implied in a 2021 interview that victims of rape and incest should be required to carry pregnancies to term, and in November he described a vote by Ohioans to add the right to abortion care to the state’s constitution as a “gut punch.”This year, he said he supports access to the abortion pill mifepristone, a view that Trump shares. \nPrime Minister KP Oli has instructed his ministers to set deadlines for their work and bring about visible changes within a month.Addressing the first Cabinet meeting on Monday after taking oath of office and secrecy from President Ramchandra Paudel, Oli urged his cabinet colleagues to work with urgency.Along with Oli, other 21 cabinet ministers also took oath of office and secrecy on Monday at a function at the President Office.“The prime minister clearly instructed us to achieve visible change and show concrete results within one month,” said Prithvi Subba Gurung, Minister for Communication and Information.The Cabinet meeting also appointed Minister Gurung as government spokesperson. But the government has decided to make public the Cabinet decisions only after 24 hours.Besides urging his Cabinet colleagues to demonstrate results within a month, the prime minister stressed the need for the government to instill hope within six months that the government is doing a good job. The prime minister also called for visible improvements across all indicators within one year, while urging ministers to enhance coordination.Gurung announced the government’s new policy of not releasing Cabinet decisions immediately. Earlier, decisions were made public soon after each Cabinet meeting.Successive governments have adopted different approaches about releasing Cabinet decisions.“Cabinet decisions will be kept confidential for 24 hours. Since we have set the rule, neither the prime minister, nor ministers can disclose them before that. Why should we immediately publicise what we are doing? It is your responsibility to learn about it after 24 hours. If we release information prematurely, that will go against our policy of confidentiality,” said Gurung after the Cabinet meeting.“If anything requires to be made public immediately, it will be announced after the Cabinet’s decision,” said Gurung.The meeting also decided to upgrade the Kirtipur-based cricket ground to a stadium, Prime Minister Oli announced on his Facebook account, adding that the construction would be completed within 300 days.The new stadium in Kirtipur will feature state-of-art amenities such as parapets for spectators, floodlights for night games, among other things and will be completed within the 300 days, Oli wrote on Facebook. Despite cricket’s growing popularity in Nepal, inadequate infrastructure has affected both players’ confidence and spectators’ enjoyment of the game. Similarly, the Cabinet also decided to compensate family members if a member goes missing and remains unlocated for ten days, with an equal amount provided for a deceased person.Minister Gurung clarified that this compensation applies mainly to people missing in landslides, floods and other natural calamities where bodies are not found within ten days. And the compensation for those injured in such disasters will be different.“This is a new decision,” said Gurung. “But in the previous guidelines, those who go missing in natural calamities were not compensated.” The meeting also entrusted Liladevi Gadtaula as acting chief secretary until a new chief secretary is appointed. This is for the first time that the government has appointed a woman as acting chief secretary. \nImports from China to Nepal rose more sharply than expected in the first eleven months of the current fiscal year ending mid-June, while imports from India continued to tumble.According to the Trade and Export Promotion Center, the national trade promotion body, Nepal’s imports from China increased by 34.8 percent in the review period. In comparison, imports from India fell by 3.1 percent.Experts attributed ballooning imports from China to a sharp rise in the entry of electric vehicles (EVs). Likewise, a fall in imports from India has been attributed to the export curbs on food by the southern neighbour. In terms of value, imports from China increased by Rs70.44 billion to Rs272.81 billion in the review period.Import from India, however, dropped by Rs29.53 billion to Rs908.30 billion in the period.Due to the drop in imports from India, Nepal’s total imports declined 1.8 percent to Rs1.45 trillion in the first eleven months of the current fiscal year, which ended mid-June 2024.An official of the National Statistics Office says for a consumption-driven economy, falling imports are a worrisome sign. This suggests people are spending less on services and consumption while exports are stagnant.Rabindra Duwadi, the spokesperson at the Trade and Export Promotion Center, said imports from the north were driven by a massive influx of EVs, smartphones, and readymade garments.Besides, exports of iron, chemical fertiliser, apples and readymade garments too rose significantly. Traders said that China fulfils 80 percent of Nepal's readymade garment needs. The country imported readymade garments worth Rs33.67 billion in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year.In the same vein, Nepal imported 7,931 EVs worth Rs21.83 billion from China in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, up from 1,269 EVs worth Rs3.75 billion in the same period last fiscal year.Similarly, the country imported 1.23 million units of smartphones worth Rs17.27 billion from China in the review period. During the time, Nepal imported 99,965 tonnes of chemical fertiliser worth Rs8.69 billion from China.In the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, the country imported 65,827 tonnes of apples worth Rs6.98 billion from China, compared to 50,153 tonnes worth Rs4.73 billion in the same period last fiscal year.Duwadi said India’s share of Nepal’s total imports is 65.5 percent, while China contributes 18.8 percent. Traders say Nepal’s trade with India is vast, but it is steadily shifting to China. “One key reason for import growth from China is EVs,” said Rajan Sharma, a trade expert. “Chinese EVs are comparatively cheaper and perform better compared to Indian ones.” According to market observers, that’s why there has been an abrupt switch from India’s Tata Nexon EV to Chinese BYD.Sharma said readymade garments imported from China are cheaper compared to Indian readymade garments, including branded ones, which makes them popular among Nepali customers. “At the same time, India-made branded clothing items are expensive.”The Chinese Shein clothing brand has quickly gained popularity in Nepal due to its trendy clothes and reasonable prices.Trade experts say that due to the open border, there has been a massive rise in informal trade from India in recent years. Smuggling has thrived after India imposed a ban on foods.According to a research report titled, ‘Dynamics of informal cross-border trade in agricultural products between Nepal and India,’ prepared by South Asia Watch on Trade, Economics and Environment, only 40 percent of rice is imported from India through formal channels.India’s share in Nepal’s imports in formal trade is 60 percent, but the share of informal trade is likely to be higher.The research has pointed out that informal trade has thrived after the imposition of a 9 percent agriculture reform fee and a 2.5 percent advanced income tax, resulting in a total duty of 11.5 percent on rice imports.The paper said that India’s ban on rice and other agricultural exports has led to massive smuggling of food through the 1,800 km porous border between Nepal and India.Nepal is dependent on onions imported from India. When the Indian government imposed a ban on onion exports from December 2023 to May 2024, the product was readily available in the vegetable market and grocery stores, which indicated that a massive quantity of onions came through informal trade channels.The government did not take a single step to control the illegal trade or negotiate with the Indian government to ease the repeated bans on export of various agricultural goods. Nepal has thus lost out on huge import revenue as goods are coming to Nepal through illegal channels and are easily available in the market.Paras Kharel, executive director of the South Asia Watch on Trade, Economics and Environment, said overall imports have not been able to rebound in two fiscal years, reflecting the country’s economic slowdown. However, the rise in EV imports contributed to the sudden rise in imports from China.“Imports from Tatopani and Rasuwa customs rose by twice as much,” Kharel said. This shows that imports from China, which were halted after the Covid pandemic, are not gradually improving but are ballooning.According to the Department of Customs, the worth of imports from Tatopani customs increased to Rs37.16 billion in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, compared to Rs11.79 billion in the same period last fiscal year.Similarly, the worth of imports from Rasuwa customs on the northern border increased to Rs55.45 billion in the review period, up from Rs27.25 billion in the same period last fiscal year. \nThe National Human Rights Commission has said that the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act must include war crimes and crimes against humanity as serious violations of human rights while also ensuring justice to former Maoist child soldiers.The constitutional human rights watchdog made its position public as the three major parties worked to finalise the amendment bill to the Act under consideration in a parliamentary committee. Neither the existing Act nor the amendment bill includes war crimes, crimes against humanity and the issues of child combatants. In its report “The National Human Rights Commission and Transitional Justice”, the commission has said that together with murder, enforced disappearance, abduction or disappearances after the kidnapping, torture, rape or other sexual violence, war crimes and crimes against humanity should also be classified as non-amnestiable crimes.The 150-page report the commission is set to unveil on Monday includes its position on the long-pending transitional justice process while also documenting the efforts it made to deliver justice to the war-era victims of human rights violations. Since its establishment in 2002, the commission has investigated 1,073 cases related to the 1996-2006 insurgency and recommended actions against 222 including former Home Secretary and chief of Nepal Police.Following successive governments’ reluctance to follow its recommendations, the commission made public the list of perpetrators in October 2020 and January 2024.The leaders in negotiation are still struggling to finalise whether to list murder as a serious violation of human rights. Despite long negotiations, they have yet to sort out issues of minor Maoist soldiers and sentence reduction. They are also divided on whether victims who refuse to reconcile should be allowed to take their cases to court.The commission’s report says killing any unarmed individual, regardless of their involvement in the conflict, or those not directly involved in the fight, is a serious violation of human rights. There cannot be amnesty for serious violations of human rights, including war crimes and crimes against humanity. Amnesty for other human rights violations is possible only with the written consent of the victims, according to the commission.“Those who refuse pardon should be allowed to seek legal remedy as per the existing laws,” reads the report. “The truth and Reconciliation Commission must delve into the cases of the victims who lost their lives or got injured in landmines planted during the insurgency even after the peace process began.” Issues of child Maoist combatants must be addressed through the law to ensure they get justice, according to the commission.The use of minors in armed conflict is a war crime as per international law. The ruling Maoist Centre, therefore, does not want to include this issue in the law.During the verification process for army integration conducted by UNMIN in 2007, thousands of Maoist fighters had been disqualified for being minors. Among the 4,008 combatants who did not qualify for integration, 2,973 were verified as minors, while the remaining 1,035 had joined the Maoist ‘People’s Liberation Army’ after the first ceasefire of May 26, 2006—six months before the signing of the peace deal. The government had provided between Rs500,000 and Rs800,000 each to the combatants who chose voluntary retirement. However, those who were disqualified didn’t get any substantial support, except for a few thousand rupees from the United Nations.A group of former child soldiers led by Lenin Bista have filed a writ petition at the Supreme Court demanding the prosecution of the then Maoist supreme commander Pushpa Kamal Dahal, now the country’s prime minister, and the then ‘people’s government’ chief Baburam Bhattarai, who also is a former prime minister. The final hearing for the petition has been slated for September.Unlike in other issues, the commission has stood with the political parties on reduced sentencing. “The jail term of convicts who meet the criteria [perpetrators cooperating in the investigation process], can be reduced to a minimum of 25 percent as per existing laws,” reads the report. “The criteria for reduced sentencing can be defined in the law.” Surya Dhungel, a commissioner, said their position is based on international practice where reduced sentencing is common in transitional justice process.The commission has also reiterated that it will send its representative to the panel formed to recommend office bearers in the two transitional justice mechanisms only if there is a commitment from the parties concerned to amend the Act. “We are firm in our decision. Commitment from top political leadership is a must for the commission to send its representative to the recommendation committee,” said Dhungel. \nIn the early 1980s, Nepal’s firebrand communist leader, Mohan Bikram Singh, split from his comrade Nirmal Lama to establish a radical political alternative. Lama and Singh had earlier revolted from the Communist Party of Nepal to establish their own faction after the party’s fourth convention in 1974. Among Singh’s trusted leaders were Mohan Baidya, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, CP Gajurel and Dev Gurung. But Singh was forced to spend most of the following years politically exiled in India. As a result, Baidya effectively captured the party, renaming it the Communist Party of Nepal (CPN), “Mashal,” pronounced slightly different from Lama’s CPN “Masal.” However, Baidya and many senior party leaders faced self-imposed demotion after the party suffered a strategic setback in the now infamous ‘Sector Scandal’. Baidya was forced to nominate Dahal as the party leader in 1989, a position Dahal has held for three and a half decades.During the first two decades of his leadership, Dahal reigned supreme, as his party led the country into a decade-long violent political conflict that claimed, by some estimates, over 16,000 lives. Despite substantial economic and political costs, the conflict accelerated Nepal’s transition from a semi-feudal society with an exclusive political system into a more inclusive and secular republic. To that end, the Dahal-led Maoist party received due recognition through a popular mandate of the 2008 first Constituent Assembly elections. But Dahal’s unnecessary distrust of Nepal’s more established political parties, which had played a considerable role in bringing his party back into the political mainstream, made him commit blunders and unseated him from a comfortable majority government. His suspicion against fellow comrades who questioned his leadership style and decisions led to multiple splintering of the Maoist party. An insecure leaderDespite leading the country in and out of a transformative political conflict and becoming one of the key signatories of the new constitution, Dahal has remained an insecure leader who takes every opportunity to remind the Nepali people and the world about his “revolutionary contributions”. Possibly, this deep-seated insecurity emerges from the fact that he is neither seen as an intellectually gifted politician like his fellow comrade Baburam Bhattarai, who is known as an ideologue of the Maoist conflict or as a leader with integrity and simplicity like that of his political gurus Singh and Baidya. The thought of losing the political legacy of the ‘People’s War’ despite clinging onto the leadership of the party must constantly haunt the Maoist supremo.Dahal’s insecurity and political hypocrisy were also palpable in the way he derided the Madhesh Movement, which also raised the agendas of federalism and inclusion. Instead of considering them allies, Dahal ordered his party cadres to attack the Madheshi party leaders and their cadres. A large part of the political onus of escalating the tensions leading to the unfortunate Gaur massacre in 2007 will always rest on Dahal. Over the past decade and a half, Dahal has repeatedly failed to display the leadership he is ironically fond of discussing. Despite mobilising thousands of Tharu youths during the conflict, he failed to support their genuine claims on provincial boundaries during the federal structuring. And despite claims of his ‘one-sided love’ for Madhesh, he remained silent as more than 50 Madhesi protesters were indiscriminately killed by the security forces in 2015. Unreliable coalition partnerThere was a time when Dahal led a party that had shaken the country’s political core. Less than two decades later, he now leads a party that has mostly eroded its political base and only relies on a stronger coalition partner to remain relevant. But has Dahal even proved to be a reliable coalition partner? Let’s take a closer look. After Baidya split the party in 2012, the CPN-Maoist was reduced to the third position in the second Constituent Assembly elections, a significant loss from its commanding majority in the first CA. In the following two years, Dahal’s party was not only kept out of power but also forced to endorse a constitution that the Nepali Congress and rival communist party CPN-UML tabled. Having lost the capacity to dictate the political course, Dahal resorted to coalition politics. When the opportunity came, he supported UML’s Khadga Prasad Oli to cobble up a coalition government in October 2015. However, when the Nepali Congress offered him to lead a new coalition, he abandoned Oli and became Prime Minister in 2016. With the 2017 elections on the horizon, Dahal knew his party would not be able to compete with the larger parties that had successfully led the constitution drafting. With some active external mediation, Dahal persuaded Oli for an electoral alliance and even agreed to an eventual unification of the communist forces. When the left unity won a landslide victory, Dahal was convinced that Oli would honour the agreement to hand over power to him mid-way through the four-year period. When Oli refused, he split the united CPN in 2020, convincing several disgruntled leaders like Madhav Nepal to abandon the party and join a coalition with the Nepali Congress. The new coalition also offered Dahal and his party a comfortable division of electoral seats in the 2022 local, provincial and federal elections. But soon after the elections were over, Dahal bargained for power with both Deuba and Oli. Despite having won only 32 seats in the federal parliament with only 11 percent popular vote, Dahal managed to become Nepal’s 33rd Prime Minister in December 2022.Impending downfallIn 2014, political analyst CK Lal had told me that Dahal’s political opportunism would make him relevant in Nepali politics for at least another decade. The Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML took exactly a decade to realise that Dahal had been cashing in on Nepal’s fractured politics. This week, the two parties agreed that Nepal’s long-term political stability requires an introspection into the present electoral system, which allows electorally less popular outfits to dictate the course of national politics. So, not only have the two large parties decided to pull the plug on the Dahal government, but they also agreed to form an independent commission to study and propose amendments to the current electoral provision.While there is little disagreement that the current electoral system paved the way for more representation of the hitherto marginalised sections, the opportunity to correct inefficacies like expensive election campaigning and manipulation of the proportional candidacy lists by the parties must not be dismissed either. There are also serious doubts about the intention of the two parties to strike a deal at a time when the Nepal Police and the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority are investigating some high-profile corruption cases. It is up to the two parties to vindicate their intent by ensuring that the new political course does not interfere in these investigations. And even if the two parties agree to amend the constitutional provisions regarding elections, they will need to gather a national consensus or at least a two-thirds majority. Whatever happens in the next few weeks and months, it is evidently clear Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s eventual political downfall is on the horizon. \nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that Nepal’s economy, still reeling from subdued domestic demand and post‑pandemic balance sheet repairs, may face an increasingly gloomy and uncertain outlook, mainly due to fragile political stability and cooperatives failure.The global lender, which provides policy advice and financing to its members to foster growth and financial stability, said Nepal’s fragile political stability could disrupt policy continuity and reform implementation. Nepal is set to elect the new prime minister next week. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is almost certain to fail the trust vote. This will be his fifth trust vote in a year and a half. The CPN-UML withdrew its support to the government on July 3 after it ditched its coalition with the CPN (Maoist Centre) and joined hands with the Nepali Congress to form a new government.This is the fourth time in Nepal’s political history that two major parties are forming a government without a powerful opposition, which observers say weakens democracy's effective functioning.On Tuesday, the IMF completed the fourth review under its four‑year extended credit facility, allowing Nepal to withdraw $41.3 million to help the country's economic recovery.This brings total disbursements under the extended credit facility for budget support to $247.7 million.The IMF executive board approved the extended credit facility arrangement for Nepal on January 12, 2022. The approved amount totals $371.6 million, which is 180 percent of Nepal’s special drawing rights quota (SDR) of 282.42 million.“Nepal’s economy continues to face challenges,” said the statement issued by the IMF on Thursday. It said that Nepal’s growth projected at 3 percent in the fiscal year 2023-24 remains below potential due to subdued domestic demand and post‑pandemic balance sheet repairs. The IMF has talked about Nepal’s cooperatives sector for the first time.In the statement, the IMF warned about the intensification of financial sector vulnerabilities, such as a further rise in non-performing loans. In this context, “more failures of cooperative lenders could endanger the banking system's soundness,” the IMF said.According to experts and bankers interviewed by the Post, cooperatives, which the government once embraced as one of the three pillars of the economy, are now threatening the economy.In Nepal, millions of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are heavily involved in cooperatives, and their failure could not only damage the fragile economy, but also harm social harmony, say experts. Cooperatives are involved in sectors ranging from dairy and livestock to tailoring and retail.Recently, thousands of victims of cooperatives fraud have staged protests in various parts of the country, demanding the return of deposits embezzled by cooperative operators. Hundreds of such depositors came to Kathmandu and staged protests. The government recently signed an agreement with them, promising to solve their problems as soon as possible.“The problem in the cooperative sector will shake up the banking sector. But if there is a wise move, the banking sector can absorb the shock,” said Upendra Poudyal, president of the Confederation of Banks and Financial Institutions Nepal. He said that the regulation of cooperatives has already been delayed. “We have seen that cooperatives are being operated for personal gains. A limited number of people took the benefit.” “Now, the central bank should begin with a single threshold. Limit the number and start supervision.” As of mid-March, there are 31,450 cooperatives in Nepal, with 7.38 million members. The deposit mobilisation in cooperatives amounted to Rs478 billion, while credit mobilisation stood at Rs405 billion. They currently employ 94,000 people.In a recent interview, Kashi Raj Dahal, immediate past chairman of the Crisis-ridden Cooperatives Management Committee, a government agency, told the Post that globally, most cooperatives work in productive sectors like food production, dairy, fruits and other agricultural activities. “But in Nepal, around 25,000 cooperatives are involved only in financial activities, mainly collecting deposits and issuing loans. Such cooperatives are now in crisis. Over 15,000 are registered to collect deposits. Even others registered as multi-purpose cooperatives primarily engage in savings and credits. Around 500 cooperatives are currently in trouble.”The Dahal-led government has promised the return of at least Rs500,000 to each depositor by recovering it from the directors' assets. Yet doubts persist about whether depositors will get back their money. Some economists have warned about potential mass protests if the cooperatives issue is not taken seriously.The IMF has also warned that the failure to raise the execution rate of large-scale projects would deprive the economy of much-needed stimulus and weigh on growth. On the pessimistic side, the IMF said that economic activity is expected to increase, reaching 4.9 percent in 2024-25, supported by more robust domestic demand. The statement reads that the cautiously accommodative monetary policy stance, the planned increase in capital expenditures in the 2024-25 budget, additional hydropower generation, and a continued rise in tourist arrivals are expected to boost domestic demand and growth. Inflation is expected to remain within the Nepal Rastra Bank’s (NRB) target ceiling of 5.5 percent.“Nepal has made important strides on its economic reform agenda. Decisive actions in monetary policy, bank regulation and rolling off Covid support policies played a major role in overcoming urgent balance of payments pressure in 2021-22,” said Bo Li, deputy managing director of IMF. “Reserves continue to rise without the need to use distortive import restrictions. Despite revenue shortfalls, fiscal discipline was maintained in 2022-23 and 2023-24. Bank supervision and regulation have improved by rolling out new supervisory information systems. Nepal’s medium-term outlook remains favourable as strategic investments in infrastructure, especially in the energy sector, are expected to support potential growth.”The IMF said that strengthening public investment management would support the needed boost to capital spending. Enhancing fiscal transparency will help contain fiscal risks and strengthen medium-term fiscal sustainability.“As monetary policy transmission is still weak in a context of balance sheet repair, a cautious and data-dependent monetary policy remains appropriate to preserve price and external stability,” the IMF said.  \nPyakuryal holds a Phd in Public Affairs from the University of Akron, US. In this interview, they discuss Nepal’s elusive political stability, the narratives governing Nepali politics, the role of patriarchy, and the trends in Nepali politics Pyakuryal will be closely following in the years ahead. \n\n\nSri Lanka’s rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences make it one of the world’s best holiday destinations. The most common sight across the island nation is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure—a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use. Despite being cash-strapped and plunging into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back, thanks to the growing number of tourists. We spent five days in the island country two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory.

The situation had been more difficult due to India’s blockade. A few months into Oli’s tenure, the southern neighbour withdrew its blockade while the constitution was amended to address the concerns of the agitating communities. Though the Madhesh-based parties boycotted voting on the constitution amendment, it had partially addressed the concerns of the dissenting groups. His government also signed a historic Trade and Transit Agreement with China, ending Nepal’s sole dependence on India for third-country trade.Oli’s nationalist graph as prime minister for 10 months between October 2015 to August 2016 went up so high that his CPN-UML not only emerged the largest party from the 2017 election but was very close to the majority mark on its own. When Oli moved into Baluwatar for the second time in February 2018, he had an even stronger electoral mandate. After a merger with the CPN (Maoist Centre) two months later, the Nepal Communist Party that he jointly led with Pushpa Kamal Dahal enjoyed a near two-thirds majority in the House of Representatives. Oli’s prime ministership started with high hopes and excitement as he was leading a majority government for the first time in around two decades. As Oli was set to lead the government for a full five-year term, the hope was that decades of political instability would end, the constitution would be implemented and the federal system strengthened. The expectations, however, were short-lived. Oli started demonstrating his authoritarian streak right after taking charge as the executive head. He brought the National Intelligence Department, the Department of Revenue Investigation and the Department of Money Laundering under the purview of the Prime Minister’s Office.His intolerance for dissent became apparent when he banned protests at Maitighar, near Singha Durbar, the government’s seat. His government then prepared a slew of bills aiming to muzzle the media, curtail freedom of expression and shrink civic space. He had contested the elections by selling big dreams—railway connecting China, Nepal’s own ship in the high seas, and distribution of gas through pipelines, among other things. But none of these dreams even came close to fruition. Having realised he had failed to deliver as promised even two years after coming to power, he played another nationalist card—amending the constitution to show Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura in Nepal’s map—which his predecessors never dared to do. While it has been registered as a historic move in the country, it antagonised New Delhi.Oli’s unilateral style of running government and leading the party forced Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Madhav Kumar Nepal to ally against him, leading to a split in the Nepal Communist Party. After failing to keep the NCP united, Oli tried to dissolve the House—twice in under six months.His decision to trample on the constitution to stay in led to his humiliating exit from the government. He was ousted by the Supreme Court. Political analysts say Oli has a historic opportunity to right the previous wrongs. “The Congress-UML alliance has generated high hopes and provides an opportunity for Oli to correct his past mistakes,” Uddhab Pyakurel, who teaches political sociology at Kathmandu University, told the Post. “However, Oli’s recent statements [on House dissolution] show he is still not in the mood for course correction. He has no regrets about his wrongdoings.”Oli has repeatedly defended his move to dissolve the House even until last month. The Congress-UML alliance stands on the foundation for stability. But how can the person who couldn’t give stability even when he commanded a majority government ensure stable government now, says Pyakurel. “Trust in the new government will be low as the parties have kept secret even the agreement that led to its formation,” he says.However, some analysts say it would not be easy for the incumbent not to deliver. “There is a strong voice within both the Congress and the UML that it is futile to form a government that cannot deliver. So the pressure to perform will come from both the ruling alliance as well as the opposition,” says Sanjeev Humagain, who teaches PhD students in politics and international relations at Tribhuvan University.“The Congress-UML coalition has the political capital needed to deliver. The bureaucracy too will find it difficult not to cooperate with the government of two major forces. I see a positive environment for delivery.” \nOn July 1, the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML reached a deal to form the government with KP Sharma Oli, the UML chairperson, taking the prime ministerial seat first. That would be possible in a coalition formed as per Article 76 (2) of the Constitution of Nepal.While the Congress and the UML were confident that Article 76 (2) would be invoked as the President invited the parties to form the new government, outgoing Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s CPN (Maoist Centre) had been claiming that the government formation process should be shifted to Article 76 (3). Maoist leaders repeatedly claimed in and outside Parliament that as the Dahal government was formed as per Article 76 (2), his successor should be appointed under Article 76 (3).Article 76 (3) coming into play meant Oli would not become the prime minister this time, as the constitutional provision pertains to a minority government led by the largest party. Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, as the parliamentary party leader of the largest party in the House of Representatives, would become the prime minister. On July 3, the UML recalled its ministers while also withdrawing its support to the Dahal government. The prime minister was then left with two options: resign or face the House.Despite knowing that he would lose the confidence motion, Dahal opted for the vote. That was because he believed the President would initiate a new government formation process under Article 76 (3) after he lost the trust vote.Article 76 (3) says in cases where the prime minister of a coalition government fails to win the confidence of Parliament, the President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the largest party in the House as prime minister. “Our party believed that Article 76 (3) would be invoked after the prime minister lost the vote of trust. This is why he [Dahal] chose the vote of confidence instead of resigning,” an office bearer of the Maoist Centre told the Post. However, President Ramchandra Paudel, hours after Dahal lost the floor test on Friday evening, called two or more parties to stake a claim to the government as per Article 76 (2). Paudel had consulted some constitutional experts before making the call. All the experts except one had suggested that he go for a coalition government—rather than a minority one—citing the Supreme Court’s rulings. They were of the opinion that there is no constitutional barrier to calling for government formation under Article 76(2) as Dahal’s floor test was his fifth since taking office in December 2022 in the House elected that year.Article 76 (3) is automatically invoked when the prime minister appointed under Article 76 (2) fails the floor test in the first attempt. The last time he faced Parliament was on May 20 after the Upendra Yadav-led Janata Samajbadi Party, Nepal withdrew its support.The Maoist Centre is not happy with the President's decision. \"Yes, the President's call is not what we wanted. We believe it was a political move rather than legal,\" Hit Raj Pandey, the party's chief whip, told the Post. Asked if his party will challenge the move in court, Pandey said \"no\".However, the party’s office bearers said the Maoist Centre will not confront the President directly. Lawyers close to the party are most likely to file a writ petition in the court.\"There is every possibility that our legal wing will challenge the President’s move in the Supreme Court,\" he told the Post. Lawyers close to the party reiterate that Article 76 (3) is the only option for government formation after the prime minister loses the vote of confidence.Former attorney general Mukti Pradhan is one of those advocates close to the Maoist Centre who make such a claim. \nIn a bid to prevent garbage from piling up on streets during the monsoon, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City has deployed heavy equipment including bulldozers, excavators, and loaders, to clear the road to the landfill site. Officials said the move aims to ensure smooth transfer of waste as roads to the landfill often become impassable during the monsoon, preventing the passage of garbage trucks.“We have deployed three excavators, two bulldozers and two loaders to clear landslide debris along the road to the Bancharedanda landfill,” said Rabinman Shrestha, chief of the Environment Department at the metropolis. “Also, we have kept five more vehicles on standby for immediate deployment if needed.”Every year, during monsoon season, the road to landfill sites gets obstructed in multiple places, obstructing the transfer of house waste collected in the three districts of the capital city—Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur. Apart from these, some local levels of Kavrepalanchok also discard garbage at the landfill site at Bancharedanda.The metropolis officials said that they had purchased 10 high-pressure pumps to drain floodwaters from inundated settlements.“Five pumps have already been sent to the high-risk areas along riversides,” said Shrestha. “These can quickly pump away floodwaters.”The city office started repairing the Sisdole road leading to the Bancharedanda landfill in Nuwakot district just a few weeks before the start of the monsoon. Officials said Rs30 million had been allocated for repairs, which included fixing potholes, concreting roads, and other works.Around 200 metres of road near the Sisdole area, which is often damaged by garbage trucks and excavators, will be concretised, according to officials.Besides monsoon-induced road obstructions, garbage disposal is sometimes disrupted due to obstructions by the residents living in settlements near and around the landfill site. These obstructions cause weeks-long halt to door-to-door garbage collection, leading people in the Valley to discard their trash on streets.Officials said that a high-pressure pump is being used to prevent the overflow of leachate from the dumping ground.Landfill leachate is a hazardous liquid containing harmful bacteria, chemicals and other components. It forms when rainwater passes through a landfill or when organic matter decomposes naturally.Officials say the leachate needs to be re-injected into the landfill, which quickens the decomposition process of the landfill waste and prevents the liquid from flowing into the river. The City office has also started segregating degradable and bio-non-degradable waste materials from households in its seven wards. Wards 5, 7, 10, 12, 24 and 27 have been segregating the waste materials generated in the households. The city office has also arranged separate trucks for collecting segregated waste materials from the households.Degradable waste materials are being turned into compost at the KMC’s waste transfer station. Officials said that the metropolis has also been using reagents to expedite the compost-making process.The city office recently sold non-degradable waste worth Rs700,000.Waste segregation at the source was one of the measures Mayor Balendra Shah touted as a solution to Kathmandu’s chronic garbage problem. After he assumed office, Shah asked city residents to start segregating waste at the source. They started doing so, using separate bins in their homes. But the plan didn’t work, largely due to a lack of preparations on the KMC’s part.The Kathmandu Valley generates over 1,200 tonnes of solid waste every day, nearly 60 percent of which comes from the KMC alone. Experts say 60 percent of organic waste originating in the Valley can be converted into compost and the remaining 30 percent of non-degradable waste can be recycled. \nIn a bid to lessen the spread of the dengue virus during the ongoing monsoon season, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City has decided to continue the drive to destroy mosquito larvae and breeding grounds. Officials at the health department of the city office said on Friday that they have just completed a week-long drive in all 32 wards of the metropolis and plan to continue these efforts in the coming days as well.“Every Wednesday, our health volunteers will visit households and open spaces to destroy mosquito breeding grounds,” said Rishi Bhusal, epidemic prevention and control focal person at the metropolis. “Decisions on preventive measures including launching search and destroy drives will depend on the spread of virus and intensity of rainfall in the coming days.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vectors also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus, according to the World Health Organisation.According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,268 people from 72 districts have been infected with the dengue virus since January this year. Among the 72 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases: 141. Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and can be treated with paracetamol at home.Dengue symptoms include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes. Patients with these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and proper medical care can prevent death.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district. Since then, an increasing number of dengue infections have been reported from many districts, including major dengue outbreaks. Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Though the post-monsoon period is considered the dengue epidemic season, the deadly disease has already become endemic in Nepal, as outbreaks of the virus are reported every month, including in the winter months.Officials at the health department said that 654 health workers, including female community health volunteers, were deployed in the week-long campaign, which concluded on Friday.“Volunteers and health workers who were deployed to the door-to-door campaign checked the mosquito breeding grounds and the larvae, made people aware about the risks and destroyed the breeding grounds,” said Bhusal. Health workers reported that storage places for scrap materials, discarded cups, and plastic in open spaces, and unused lands as potential hotspots for the dengue virus in the coming days. Health workers have warned owners of these sites that action will be taken if mosquito larvae are found against the owner of the storage place if mosquito larvae were found.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects, such as plastic cups and bottles, could be breeding grounds for these mosquitoes.Public health experts say now is the right time to prepare for and prevent possible outbreaks. Health ministry officials said they have alerted all related agencies to the risk of a dengue outbreak. \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City has imparted mental health screening training to doctors and paramedics serving at urban health promotion centres.Officials at the Health Department in the metropolis hope that the move will help hundreds of patients with mental health issues in the city to get timely treatment.“Getting free treatment for mental health problems comes under the right to get free basic health care services,” said Sajina Maharjan, acting head of the department. “Mental health problem screening training to doctors and paramedics will help in the timely diagnosis of the problems and start of early treatment.”At least 32 doctors serving at the urban health promotion centres under the city office and dozens of paramedics participated in five-day screening training. The metropolis has upgraded its urban health clinics to urban health promotion centres and started providing services through medical doctors. “Due to the lack of doctors at our urban health promotion centres, patients suffering from mental health problems have been deprived of timely treatment,” said Nali Bajracharya, a senior public health officer at the department. “Now patients having mental health issues and seeking care at our health centres will also get mental health treatment.”Though neither the federal government agency nor the city office has data on the number of people suffering from mental health problems in the metropolis, doctors estimated that a lot of people could be suffering from various forms of mental health problems—anxiety, depression and others.Officials say that they are also planning to provide free medication to patients with mental health problems.Health workers say that many city dwellers, despite having mental health problems, do not seek treatment and instead turn to drugs and substances to cope. Due to the entrenched social stigma, fear of discrimination and other factors, many patients in Nepal do not talk about their mental health issues.The general tendency among people to conceal mental health issues due to the stigma attached to it has also forced patients to opt for substance abuse, doctors say.They say that while drugs and alcohol may provide temporary relief from stress, they are not a solution and can adversely affect mental health and well-being in the long run.“Treatment in the initial stage of mental illness helps patients achieve better results. For that, early diagnosis is crucial,” said Dr Pomawati Thapa, chief of the Non-communicable Disease and Mental Health Section at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Other local units should also follow the initiative to provide mental health screening training to health workers, including doctors.”Nepal is among the countries with highest rates of suicide, which is an extreme manifestation of a mental health problem.According to Nepal Police data, 6,993 people took their own lives in the fiscal year 2022-2023. This accounts for more than 19 deaths on average daily. Fifty-six percent of those who die by suicide are men.Doctors say that people do not attempt suicide for a single reason, but due to a complex situation arising from multiple problems.An increasing number of people are struggling with mental problems owing to the rising cost of living and the struggle to manage even their most basic needs, such as food, housing, healthcare and jobs, experts say.Whatever the cause, suicides and suicide attempts have a ripple effect, impacting families, friends, colleagues, communities and societies, doctors say.A study carried out by the Nepal Health Research Council in the past shows that about 13 percent of Nepalis suffer from some form of mental disorder. This means around one in eight Nepalis has mental health issues. Moreover, the country simply does not have enough experts to treat mental health problems, it added.Studies show the magnitude of suffering, the burden and costs for individuals, families and societies arising from mental health disorders are alarming in Nepal.“No doubt, mental health problems have been emerging as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in our country,” said Thapa. “All local governments must take initiative to address the problems. Only the federal government agencies cannot do much.”The World Health Organisation says that one in four people in the world has been affected by mental or neurological disorders at some point in their lives, and around 450 million people currently suffer from such conditions, placing mental disorders among the leading causes of ill health and disability worldwide. \nDuring the 2022 local level election, people of Kathmandu elected independent candidate Balendra Shah as their mayor for five years. Sunita Dangol of the CPN-UML secured the position of KMC deputy mayor in the same election. When they began their term, many suspected that the two—an independent mayor and his party-affiliated deputy—wouldn’t have cordial relations. But, in the last two years of their term, there has been no visible disagreement between them. They proved their sceptics wrong.Deputy Mayor Dangol kept mum when Mayor Shah accused her party chair, KP Sharma Oli, of policy corruption in the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate land scam.Moreover, Shah expressed his anger on June 3 over the government’s intervention in his plan to widen pavements in the New Road area. Deputy Prime Minister Raghubir Mahaseth of the UML leads the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, which maintains major roads.After the ministry intervened in the municipal plan to expand the sidewalk on New Road, Shah took to social media and wrote, “Honourable KP Oli jyu, don’t hoodwink people by engineering yet another scam to hide a scam of Rs10,000 crore [Rs100 billion].”He further added, “You have reassured those who had made advance payments to buy land of Giri Bandhu Tea Estate that they would get the land within two years.” “If one looks at the policy corruption in the tea estate, it appears not a single leaf would stir without Oli’s nod,” Shah wrote.A few days prior to the incident, Mayor Shah had engaged in a heated debate with Chinkaji Maharjan, a UML member and chairman of KMC’s ward 22, over the sidewalk expansion plan.Dangol remained quiet on the issue thus far. However, at the city council meeting on Monday, which also discussed KMC's policies and programmes for the fiscal year 2024-25, she criticised Mayor Shah for his remarks.“This should be the first time the deputy mayor opposed the public behavior and statement of the mayor,” a Kathmandu ward chairperson told the Post on the condition of anonymity.Dangol had her initial plan to contest the mayor position independently but the UML gave her the deputy mayor’s ticket.Speaking during the Monday discussion, Deputy Mayor Dangol said, addressing Mayor Shah, “Your and mine voices are being heard and watched by Nepalis worldwide. Therefore, those of us who want to come to politics should think about our expression,” Dangol remarked. “We should maintain the image and dignity of the institution we represent.”She also emphasised the need to accommodate the voices of everyone in an undertaking.Though the representatives of Kathmandu Metropolitan City claim that Dangol's Monday statement was unusual, they deny any rift between the two leaders of the local government. “City council’s is an internal meeting of the KMC where various issues arise. We settle those issues internally,” Nabin Manandhar, the KMC spokesperson and ward 17 chairman from the Nepali Congress, told the Post. “Having an opinion does not necessarily mean criticism.”Rajesh Kumar Shrestha, chair of KMC ward 19, seconded Manandhar.However, local representatives of Kathmandu have been questioning Shah for his ‘lone-wolf’ manner of leading the institution.“We should develop a working relationship that welcomes everyone’s spirit,” Dangol told the council meeting. “If one thinks they are in a position and everything should be done as they say, it will only lead to trouble.”She added, “While working in a team, we definitely have a different opinion, but different opinions should be respected.”At the meeting, referring to Mayor Shah's past statements, council member Anita Karki asked him, saying, “What if the voters of Kathmandu set ablaze the Durbar where the KMC office lies?”In September last year, when the traffic police obstructed a KMC vehicle, later known to be used by his postpartum wife, Mayor Shah provocatively wrote on Facebook, threatening to burn Singha Durbar, the federal government’s central secretariat.Traffic police, under the federal government, had stopped the vehicle to check necessary documents on a Saturday.After the incident, Shah wrote on social media warning that if the government blocked KMC's vehicles again, he would set fire to Singha Durbar.Dangol said on Monday that she believed it was wrong to write on social media or make a statement inciting people to burn the Singha Durbar or the Bagh Durbar, where the KMC office is situated.Dangol, speaking at the city council meeting, also said there should be no polarisation between the representatives who were elected to develop Kathmandu. \nA police officer was found dead on the premises of the federal parliament building in Baneshwar, Kathmandu on Wednesday.According to Ekram Giri, spokesperson for the federal parliament secretariat, Ajit Gole of Dolakha committed suicide by shooting himself.The body of the victim was recovered from the parliament building’s washroom.Dinesh Mainali, spokesperson for the Kathmandu Metro Police Range, said Gole, who was on duty from 6am to 10am, was found dead at around 8 in the morning. “A constable of Nepal Police was found dead inside a toilet of the parliament building,” Mainali told the Post. “Preliminary investigation shows he was inflicted with a gunshot.”Nepal police said the investigation is underway. \nGopi Man Shrestha and his family migrated to Chitwan from Lamjung in 1970. The pull factor was fertile land and irrigation facilities in the plains.The Shresthas purchased two bighas of land in Ameliya, Madi. Paddy yield was high due to the soil rich in nutrients and easy availability of irrigation. The family was also able to sell the grains after storing the year’s need for consumption. “I purchased two more bighas,” Shrestha said.Hundreds of families, particularly those in the hills, migrated to Chitwan in the 1970s and 1980s, in search of fertile lands. However, the situation is different now. Shrestha still owns land in Ameliya, but does not cultivate it. Locals are leaving the villages of Ameliya, adjoining the Chitwan National Park, Nepal’s first wildlife sanctuary. As the village gradually began emptying, paddy transplantation has also stopped.“Now, we buy rice to eat,” Shrestha said.Purnamaya Adhikari of Jiwanpur, Khaireni Municipality Ward 10, has been growing paddy on a bigha and a half. She has not switched to other crops but has seen banana plants grow on her neighbours' fields.“Many farmers have switched to banana. Paddy is least preferred,” Adhikari said.Chitwan has seen farmers switching to cash crops as the income from paddy is low.Statistics at the Agriculture Development Office, Chitwan show that paddy plantation area is shrinking fast.In the key season, the monsoon, farmers produce paddy on 22,000 hectares, down from 31,000 hectares two decades ago. The office record shows that paddy production peaked in 2002–03 when the Maoist insurgency compelled people to rush to the Tarai.Indra Dhungana, chief of the Project Implementation Unit, Bharatpur, under the Prime Minister Agriculture Modernisation Project, said there are no specific studies, but paddy cultivation in Chitwan is declining. “It’s because Chitwan has grown into a residential area, with land being plotted for housing.”The paddy fields in Chitwan have been filled with concrete houses in just 20 years. Besides, farmers have started searching for alternative sources of income. As commercial banana and vegetable farming and fisheries expand, paddy fields are vanishing, Dhungana said.Umraj Aryal, an official at the Agriculture Development Office, Chitwan, said the commercial vegetable farming trend is steady. “Nowadays, capsicum farming is growing in east Chitwan,” he said. “As the capsicum is sowed in early September, transplanting paddy [in the summer] is impossible.”Residential area has increased in Bharatpur wards 11 and 12. Around 20 years ago, those areas mostly remained filled with paddy, Aryal said. The Padampur area inside the national park, known for high paddy yield, has been shifted to Barandabhar forest south of the highway. In the new Padampur, banana and vegetable farming is thriving.Satya Narayan Chaudhary of Ratnanagar, Bichauli, does not believe that the paddy acreage has declined. “People have stopped farming.”As farmhands are not readily available, there has been a growing use of machines, he said.“Farmers are switching to other crops,” he said, admitting that land development for housing has increased. “It’s a serious issue.”According to statistics, vegetable farming and fisheries in Chitwan covered 2,132 hectares and 68 hectares during 1998-99.Vegetable farming has currently expanded to 6,503 hectares. However, since vegetable farming depends on the cropping cycle, it does not create a huge gap in the paddy production area, Chaudhary said.Paddy transplantation, however, cannot be done in fields used for commercial Banana farming and fisheries.Banana fields in Chitwan cover 2,200 hectares, while fish ponds have expanded to 800 hectares.“With the decline in paddy production, hay output has also fallen. Straw is a huge source of animal feed. Along with rice, Chitwan now imports straw too,” said Jhalak Nath Kandel, chief of the Agriculture Development Office.He said that the rice deficit in Nepal currently stands at 581,505 tonnes. “It’s a serious issue if paddy plantation areas decline. The country’s food import bill has ballooned.”Summer production has declined by a fourth, but there has been some growth in spring paddy areas and output. In the fiscal year 2002-23, spring paddy was transplanted on 3,750 hectares, which increased to 5,540 hectares in 2022-23. This fiscal year, spring paddy is growing on 7,000 hectares. “Demand for spring paddy is rising. A kind of cash crop, its farming is increasing,” said Nirmal Poudel, an agri economist at the Agriculture Development Office, Chitwan.Agriculture technicians say spring paddy is less prone to diseases. As it is produced in a season with little rainfall, it is largely unaffected by pests. This pushes the yield up. The summer paddy productivity stands at 4.4 tonnes per hectare while spring paddy output is 5.6 tonnes. According to Dhungana, farmers harvested 6.4 tonnes of spring paddy a hectare this spring.Due to farm mechanisation and improved irrigation, summer paddy also sees better harvest now. \nThe British Education Group, which owns The British College, Kathmandu, has now acquired the Maritime Business College (MBC), one of the oldest private institutes in Nova Scotia, Canada.Founded in 1899, MBC has a rich history of providing advanced career training. Over 125 years, the Halifax-based institution has built a strong reputation for educational excellence and adaptability in the evolving job market. The British Education Group said in a press statement that the local Ministry of Education also fully accredited the college as a Designated Learning Institution (DLI), making it one of the few private colleges in Canada authorised to recruit international students.They currently offer a diverse range of programmes, including Business Administration, Veterinary Assistance, Medical Device Reprocessing, Interior Decorating, and 2D-3D Animation and Digital Arts. As a result of this new partnership, the British Education Group plans to introduce additional courses offered at its London campus, Woolwich College. Rajen Kandel, Group CEO of the British Education Group, said, “We are committed to providing our students with global opportunities and experiences. This acquisition will facilitate seamless credit transfers between our Nepal, Dubai, and Canada campuses, further promoting our vision of creating global citizens.” The group owns several educational institutions in Nepal, Dubai, and London.  \nNepal recorded its historic high income from tourism in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, which ended mid-June, according to the latest data issued by Nepal Rastra Bank. Industry insiders attribute this to the appreciation of the US dollar.The central bank said that the country earned Rs76.55 billion from tourism in the review period, surpassing the record set in 2018-19 when the country had earned Rs75.37 billion from 1.2 million foreign tourists. (At that time, the exchange rate was $1=Rs112.9.)According to a central bank report, Nepal received 1.06 million tourists in the first 11 months.“The surge in tourism income is primarily a result of the exchange rate,” said Deepak Raj Joshi, former CEO of Nepal Tourism Board. Any adjustments in the exchange rate will prompt an appreciation or depreciation of the tourist’s currency, affecting transport costs and the tourist’s decisions to visit the country. “Thus, the exchange rate impacts the number of tourist visits and tourism receipts,” said Joshi.“Besides, the growth of international chain hotels and Nepal gradually switching to a digital payment system has also contributed to the growth in tourism income.”The tourism ministry’s statistics show that the average stay of tourists in Nepal is currently 13.2 days, while they spend $41 per day.Gunakar Bhatta, spokesperson for the Nepal Rastra Bank, said the depreciated exchange rate positively relates to the tourism demand, as travel becomes less expensive when visiting a devalued country. “The currency factor, normally, forces tourists to select a destination before a trip. In this context, a country with a depreciation in domestic currency will attract international tourists,” said Bhatta. He said that while most of Nepal’s economic indicators have been underperforming, tourism has been doing exceptionally well.While Nepal’s economy is anticipated to grow by 3.87 percent in the current fiscal year, accommodation and food service, which are linked to tourism activities, are expected to see a robust growth of 21.84 percent, the highest among all 18 economic compositions in the Nepali economy.“This shows how the tourism industry has been a boon for Nepal’s sluggish economic growth.”The digital payment system has also been making tourism income transparent. Paras Kunwar, chief operating officer of Fonepay, said Indian tourists have been spending Rs5 million a day since Nepal started the payment system through the quick response (QR) code on March 1.“Since the central bank has fully opened the digital retail payment gateway for Nepali operators with any other country, it will help bring more foreign currencies.”Through the budget, the government has announced that it will draw 1.6 million foreign visitors this year.According to industry insiders, the target is attainable, but there are a few challenges.From November 8, Kathmandu’s Tribhuvan International Airport will be closed for 10 hours daily, from 10 pm to 8 am, for five months until March 31, to expand the taxiways.September-November is Nepal’s peak tourist season.Besides, industry insiders say the Nepal Tourism Board has been headless for the past four months, affecting all international promotional and marketing events.A number of reports, including the latest by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), said Nepal’s economic activity is expected to pick up, with growth reaching 4.9 percent in the next fiscal year 2024-25. This growth will be supported by an increase in tourist arrivals, boosting domestic demand. According to the Nepal Tourism Board, the country’s tourism promotional body, in 2023, tourist arrivals crossed the million mark for the first time in four years.Foreign arrivals had crossed the one million mark for the first time in 2018 when the country received 1.17 million foreign visitors.The number reached 1.19 million in 2019. Then, the Covid pandemic started in early 2020, bringing arrivals to a standstill. Travel restrictions and an economic slowdown triggered by lockdowns delivered a massive blow to Nepal’s burgeoning tourism industry, decimating revenues and profits after 2020.Nepal received 230,085 and 150,962 tourists in 2020 and 2021, respectively. In 2022, the number shot up to 614,869.Joshi said that by the end of 2024, Nepal may get 1.2 million tourists in the year. “A careful execution of plan and proper marketing, especially in China, could boost arrivals to 1.6 million,” said Joshi. “It will be justified to shift Kathmandu’s airport expansion from November to December, to let the peak season pass.”Dozens of luxury hotels have opened across the country so there are no problems with accommodation, he said. Nepal has been widening roads and building other infrastructure, like airports, which will help attract more tourists. However, industry insiders say the government’s neglect of air safety problems could hinder future growth, particularly in the high-end segment, where travellers consider the safety of any destination country while making travel plans.Most embassies have put Nepal’s air safety situation on their travel advisories. The European Commission imposed this list in 2013 after Nepali airlines failed to meet international safety standards. The government has wilfully ignored the call of the United Nations aviation watchdog, the International Civil Aviation Organisation, to split Nepal’s civil aviation body into two entities: service provider and regulator. The separation is a crucial organisational reform agenda which has been a work in progress for the past one and a half decades. \nNepal’s central bank has allowed Nepali payment system operators to deal with digital retail payments in any country. For example, a Nepali payment system operator (PSO) can now agree with any PSO in any country to launch the quick response (QR) code payment system for the citizens of both countries to make purchases. Nepal Rastra Bank issued a circular on June 27, allowing a merchant-to-person payment (M2P) system. PSOs can now make agreements with PSOs of any country and start the service. However, before signing a memorandum of understanding, the PSOs need the central bank’s approval.“The central bank has fully opened the retail payment system. Nepali PSOs and PSOs of any country can now jointly start the retail payment service through QR code,” said Gunakar Bhatta, executive director of the Payment Systems Department at Nepal Rastra Bank.As the central bank has allowed merchant payment on the purchase of goods and services, the PSOs have started taking approval to start the service, Bhatta said. By coordinating on issues like bank settlement and dispute settlement, the licensed private sector PSOs can start the service.The central bank said that the withdrawal limit for a Nepali in a foreign country would be according to the existing foreign exchange rule, which is $2,500 per visit and $5,000 annually. There are 10 PSOs operating in the country as of mid-May.The QR code system in Nepal is relatively new.Starting March 1, Indians were allowed to make payments through their mobile phones. The development was hailed as a milestone in cross-border digital payment between Nepal and India, facilitating the students and people going to India for medical purposes.Nepal’s Fonepay, a PSO, has partnered with India’s NPCI International Payments to launch the cross-border payment service using quick response (QR) codes.With the central bank's provision, Fonepay has already started working, allowing Nepali nationals to make QR code payments in India.On June 1 last year, Fonepay signed a memorandum of understanding with Sri Lanka’s National Payment Network—LankaPay, to collaborate on a strategic partnership to revolutionise the digital payment landscape by developing an interoperable digital payment system that enables users to transact seamlessly across the two countries.However, in the lack of regulations, the QR code payment system did not start. “We have requested the approval for QR code payment service with Sri Lanka. We will soon start the facility,” said Paras Kunwar, chief operating officer (COO) of Fonepay. “Besides Sri Lanka, China is another market that we are looking at. We have started discussions with China UnionPay and Alipay+ to make cross-border QR code payments.”In May 2019, Nepal banned WeChat Pay and AliPay, stating that online payments through unregistered systems were illegal and resulted in a loss of income for Nepal. WeChat Pay, operating on Tencent’s messaging service, and e-commerce giant Alibaba’s Alipay are the two dominant platforms in mainland China.In June last year, Chinese digital payment service WeChat Pay and NMB Bank Nepal partnered to make the mobile payment system available in Nepal, allowing Chinese nationals visiting Nepal to pay for their purchases using their mobile sets.Kunwar said they would begin a QR code system in India from August. “For this, Nepali commercial banks are working on transaction limits and other issues.“We also need to adhere to many provisions including anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) before starting the cross-border payment services.”Kunwar said that the company is looking for other potential markets overseas where most Nepalis reside. For instance, South Korea is another prospective market for QR code payment.“We are looking into whether remittances can be sent through QR code if the central bank allows it. Nepal can be a potential market for tourists from South Korea and Japan and the service can allow them to withdraw money in Nepal.”Just like regional economic blocs, the payment service has also started making regional payment blocs. There is Asian Payment Network, a retail payment platform supported by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Kunwar said.“There are 17 members of the Asian Payment Network of ASEAN, including Sri Lanka from South Asia. Fonepay recently became a member of the Asian Payment Network, and with this, we can integrate the system with the 17 member countries.”The QR code system has become a boon for tourists, especially those from India.For instance, within three months of starting QR code payments to Indian citizens, Fonepay is handling around Rs5 million transactions daily. It has reduced the hassle of carrying cash. The Nepal government has banned all Indian notes above the denomination of 100.With the Fonepay service available in Muktinath and trekking areas connected to Pokhara, Indian tourists are increasingly withdrawing money while in these areas. According to a central bank report, QR code transactions sharply increased to Rs52.75 billion in mid-May from Rs45.67 billion in mid-April, after Nepal allowed Indian citizens to make payment via QR code in Nepal. The number of transactions also increased to 17.63 million from 16.10 million during the review period.QR code transactions increased to Rs53.88 billion from mid-May to mid-June, with a total of 19.82 million transactions. \nIn a bid to reduce patient deaths in hospital emergencies, the Ministry of Health and Population has started providing basic life support training to health workers.Officials hope that ongoing deaths in hospital emergencies would come down significantly once health workers were trained in basic life support.“Around 900 health workers, including medical doctors, nurses, paramedics, and health assistants, have already been trained with basic life support skills,” said Dr Prakash Budhathoky, spokesman for the ministry. “The remaining health workers will receive training in the new fiscal year.”Basic life support is a type of care that first responders, who could be health workers serving in hospital emergencies, provide to anyone suffering from cardiac arrest, respiratory distress and other life-threatening conditions.Experts say basic life support is very crucial in emergency situations—cardiac arrest, and trauma cases, among others. The procedure includes recognising and responding to emergency situations, seeking help, performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and providing breathing assistance.Chances of survival will be high if trained health workers respond to the cases first. Officials said that the number of patient deaths in emergencies could be reduced significantly if all health workers serving in hospital emergencies were trained with basic life support skills.“We will also encourage provincial governments to provide basic life support skills to health workers serving in provincial hospitals and health centres run by local units,” said Budhathoky. “Those serving in emergencies at private health facilities will also get this training.”Doctors say that basic life support skills can be effective in saving lives when provided promptly and correctly. Health officials say many health workers serving in emergencies of health facilities, especially those hired newly, do not have basic life support skills.Meanwhile, the Nepal Medical Council, the national regulatory body for medical doctors, said it is working to make continuous professional development training mandatory for licence renewal.“Doctors must pass a 100-mark test on ethics, basic life support, communication, infection control and the rational use of medicines,” said Dr Bishwa Raj Dawadi, the council member. “Gone are the days when one would remain a doctor simply by obtaining a medical degree. They must be updated with skills and new knowledge.”A few years ago, the Council made professional development training mandatory for all medical doctors. Failure to attend the course will result in non-renewal of the medical licence.Medical doctors undergo the training regularly, and the council assesses its effectiveness every five years to ensure that doctors providing health care services are updated in their profession.Professional training involves processes that act as refresher courses to update and enhance a doctor’s knowledge, skills, and experience, even after the completion of their formal degree. It can take the form of fellowships, seminars, workshops, conferences, and continuous medical education.The NMC said that CPD (continuous professional development training) is a lifelong process of learning and updating professional skills.Doctors also need to take effective communication skills training so that they can communicate with the families and relatives of patients about their condition and the treatment process, including surgeries. In recent years, there have been reports of scuffles between hospitals/doctors and the kin of patients in the event of a patient’s death. At times, situations have taken a nasty turn in which doctors have been manhandled and hospitals vandalised.The medical council said that implementation of the code of ethics has been a challenge thus far and that training such as the CPD could help in its effective enforcement. One of the problems the NMC is facing currently is its inability to prevent doctors and health institutions from advertising their skills and profession using mass media, which, according to the NMC, is against the code of ethics. \nIn a bid to support midwives and other healthcare personnel in ensuring safer births in low-resource settings, the Ministry of Health and Population has launched a “safe delivery app”.Officials hope that the mobile application will complement and enhance the ongoing capacity-building of health workers and help in reducing maternal and newborn deaths.“The Safe Delivery App provides up-to-date lifesaving procedures and practical guidance in the local language,” said Dr Bibek Kumar Lal, director of the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services, at the launch of the Nepali version of the Safe Delivery App. “It aims to improve the quality of emergency obstetric and newborn care, and the main users will be our frontline health workers, especially nurses and midwives.”Officials at the division said that the government has collaborated with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the Maternity Foundation (MF) to launch the Nepali version of the widely used digital health tool.Globally, every two minutes, a woman dies. In Nepal, two women die every day due to pregnancy-related complications—most of which are preventable, said Won Young Hong, a UNFPA representative in Nepal. “These are staggering numbers. UNFPA is pleased to work with the concerned stakeholders to localise this digital application so healthcare workers across Nepal can use it.”The Safe Delivery App is an evidence-based learning and training tool designed to support midwives, nurses, and other healthcare professionals to assist during births and to manage the most common complications. Among other features, it contains the latest clinical guidelines, animated instruction videos, descriptions of practical procedures, and action cards. It is free, and once downloaded on a smartphone or a tablet, it works offline, making it possible to be used even in the most remote areas. To date, more than 435,000 healthcare professionals across more than 70 countries have been reached through the Safe Delivery App and the accompanying programme worldwide, with Nepal being the latest country to introduce the App. “We will work with provincial governments and development partners to quickly roll out the App throughout Nepal,” said Lal.Nepal cut the maternal mortality rate from 539 per 100,000 births in 1996 to 239 per 100,000 births in 2016—for which the country even received a Millennium Award. According to the National Statistics Office report, the country has further reduced the number of deaths to 151 per 100,000 births in 2021. Maternal health experts, however, say that even if the country has made good progress in reducing maternal deaths, the current maternal mortality ratio is more than double the Sustainable Development Goals target, which is 70 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births by 2030.Neonatal deaths have not declined between 2016 and 2022, according to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022 carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population.The government’s target for the Sustainable Development Goals was to reduce neonatal mortality to 16 deaths per 1,000 live births by 2022 and 12 in every 1,000 live births by 2030.The SDGs, a follow-up on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), aim to end poverty, hunger, and all forms of inequality worldwide by 2030, and Nepal has committed to meeting the goals.The health ministry has been taking several measures to reduce maternal and neonatal deaths, including installing an underfloor heating system at birthing centres, setting up special newborn care units, training doctors, nurses, and paramedics in the district hospitals and distributing non-pneumatic anti-shock garments to prevent maternal deaths from excessive bleeding.Besides, the ministry provides free service and travel allowances for those opting for institutional delivery and antenatal visits. It also distributes misoprostol, a medication used to treat postpartum bleeding in new mothers, through female community health volunteers. \nAs heavy monsoon rains cause chaos across the country, dengue cases are surging in several districts, including Kathmandu.According to the Health Office Kathmandu, around 18 people are infected with the dengue virus every day. Officials, however, admit that this number could be just the tip of the iceberg, as the office gets reports only from 18 health facilities.“Yes, the number of people infected with the dengue virus could be several times higher than suggested by the reports we are getting every day,” said Dr Arjun Sapkota, chief of the Health Office, Kathmandu. “We are working to make daily reporting of dengue cases mandatory for private health facilities as well.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vectors also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus, according to the World Health Organisation.According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,432 people from 73 districts have been infected with the virus since January this year. Among the 73 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases with 159, followed by Jhapa with 120, Chitwan 83, Makawanpur 65, Tanahun and Doti 49 cases each, and Okhaldhunga and Sindhupalchowk 46 each.Sapkota informed that his office has sensitised the local bodies about the looming risk of a massive dengue outbreak in the coming days.“Mandatory reporting of dengue cases every day is among the preventive measures through which we can identify dengue hotspots,” said Sapkota. “This will help health workers target such measures in particular areas. Additionally, starting this week, we are resuming the “10 minutes at 10 am” initiative every Friday, during which mosquito breeding grounds will be destroyed.”Officials informed that several local units, including the Kathmandu Metropolitan City, have already started preventive measures against dengue. Dengue symptoms include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes. Patients with these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and proper medical care can prevent death.Doctors say many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and can be treated with paracetamol at home.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district. Since then, an increasing number of dengue infections, including major outbreaks, have been reported from many districts. Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Though the post-monsoon period is considered the dengue epidemic season, the deadly disease has already become endemic in Nepal, as outbreaks are reported every month, including in the winter months.According to health workers, storage places for scrap materials, discarded cups, plastic material tossed in open spaces, and unused lands will be potential hotspots for the dengue virus in the coming days. Health workers have warned the owners of these sites that action will be taken if mosquito larvae are found there.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects, such as plastic cups and bottles, could be breeding grounds for these mosquitoes. \nWith monsoon havoc sweeping across the country, the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division has urged health workers to avoid taking leave during the season.Officials have warned that health facilities could be overwhelmed by patients in the coming days as outbreaks of waterborne and vector-borne diseases are expected, as floodwaters have contaminated most of the drinking water sources.“We have requested the provincial and local health authorities not to grant leave to health workers during the monsoon season,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director of the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Health agencies have been cautioned about the looming risk of outbreaks of waterborne and vector-borne diseases in the coming days.”Torrential rainfall started Friday wreaking havoc in various places across the country. At least 14 people have died in disaster-related incidents—nine in landslides and five in floods—since Friday, according to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority. Officials said 18 others have been injured, and four people are missing. Since the monsoon entered the country on June 10, at least 43 people have died in landslides and flood-related incidents. Lightning strikes killed as many as 19 people during this period.The monsoon season in Nepal is a time of epidemics during which thousands of people across the country become infected with water-borne and vector-borne diseases.The persistent rainfall that started on Friday not only destroyed houses and inundated settlements but also contaminated drinking water sources.Health officials warned that health facilities could witness an uptick in the number of viral fever cases, and waterborne diseases—diarrhoea, dysentery, food poisoning, and snake bites—in the coming days.“We have also requested central hospitals and medical colleges to be prepared for help during disease outbreaks,” said Ghimire. “As we don’t have enough doctors and health workers to deploy to control the outbreaks, we have to seek help from big hospitals and medical colleges.”Officials at the Ministry of Health and Population said that they have been raising awareness through all available means to inform people of the risks. “Essential medicines have been stockpiled, health workers have been asked to be ready for deployment to affected areas, anti-snake venom has been supplied to health facilities,” said Dr Prakash Budhathoki, spokesperson at the Health Ministry. “As of Sunday evening, no outbreaks have been reported.”According to health experts, sources of drinking water generally become contaminated in disaster-hit areas, and people displaced by natural disasters become highly vulnerable to infections with waterborne and vector-borne diseases. Every year, thousands of people get infected with vector-borne diseases such as dengue, kala-azar, malaria, and scrub typhus during this period. Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts. According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,432 people from 73 districts have been infected with the dengue virus since January this year. Among the 73 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases: 159. Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. Likewise, snakebite incidents and resulting deaths are also common during the season, but the phenomenon, which experts dub “a lurking invisible crisis”, remains grossly neglected. “Incidents of snakebites have started to surge over the last few weeks,” said Dr Rajiv Jha, director at Provincial Health Directorate of Madhesh Province. “Along with the surge in waterborne and vector-borne diseases in the coming days, we have anticipated a rise in snakebite cases.”Doctors say the only ways to prevent deaths from waterborne diseases, including diarrhoea, are to raise awareness and ensure safe drinking water.They say a combination of careful surveys, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation and treatment are required to contain the spread of the diarrhoeal infection. \nWith the onset of the rainy season, the incidents of snakebite are on the rise in western Tarai districts.Snakebite treatment centres and hospitals in Kanchanpur and Kailali districts of Sudurpaschim province are now crowded with snakebite patients. Treatment of the snakebite patients, according to health workers, is quite challenging as patients are often brought to the health facilities at the last minute.As many as 60 snakebite patients visited the Snakebite Treatment Centre set up by Nepal Army at Arjuni of Shuklaphanta National Park within the past three weeks. “Over the past one week three to four snakebite patients have been visiting the centre on a daily basis,” said Ratan Bohora, a paramedic at the Arjuni-based Snakebite Treatment Centre. The local residents have hugely benefited after the Nepali Army and the local community jointly established the snakebite treatment centre at Arjuni in 2014. The centre, however, has to refer the patients with serious health conditions to other well facilitated hospitals due to the lack of an intensive care unit (ICU) and ventilator. “Two patients who were bitten by poisonous snakes were referred to Mahakali Provincial Hospital in Mahendranagar this year. We have no alternative but to send serious cases of snakebite to other hospitals due to the lack of the ICU and ventilator facilities,” said Bohora. The centre also does not even have a monitor to track a patient's vital signs such as blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen levels. The flow of the patients is increasing, but the centre only has two paramedics to provide treatment.Incidents of snakebite and resulting deaths are common in Nepal, but the issue still remains grossly neglected as what experts call a lurking ‘invisible crisis’. Each year, around 2,700 people, mostly children and women from Nepal’s Tarai region, die of snakebites, according to a March 2022 report.Most snakebite incidents occur when farmers are transplanting paddy fields or children are playing outdoors. Health workers say that the snakes that live in water are generally less poisonous. “The cases that are most serious occurred at night, often inside houses. Such patients should be taken to hospital immediately,” said Bohora. According to him, people living in thatched-roof houses are especially vulnerable to snakebite, because snakes often enter such homes in search of rats.Nepal is home to around 17 highly venomous snakes. Each year, the country sees about 20,000 to 40,000 cases of snakebite. The numbers could be higher, as many cases of snakebite go unreported, health workers say.Another health challenge in rural Nepal is the superstitious belief in visiting shamans instead of seeking treatment at medical facilities for snakebite. Experts say awareness drives should be launched to educate people that the snakebite patients should be taken to the hospital at the earliest. They recommend promoting cleanliness around homes, preventing children from playing in bushy areas, avoiding nightime walks, and using torchlight while walking in the dark.“Treatment of snakebite patients is possible if they are taken to health facilities on time. Patients are often brought to the hospital only after their condition has worsened, resulting in serious consequences,” said Dr Arjun Bhatta, medical superintendent at Mahakali Provincial Hospital. According to him, 10 snakebite patients with serious health conditions visited the hospital in the past three weeks. “They returned home after treatment,” said Bhatta. \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar. \nThe noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built. Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nGermany’s Thomas Mueller has called time on his 14-year international career after their European Championship exit, the Bayern Munich forward said on Monday.The 34-year-old featured in his eighth and last tournament on July 5, in Germany’s 2-1 quarter-final defeat by Spain, where he was brought on as a substitute in the 80th minute.Muller helped Germany win the 2014 World Cup and has the third most appearances for the national team with 131 caps and 45 goals. He also won the Golden Boot and Young Player Award during the 2010 World Cup, when Germany finished third.“It always made me very proud to play for my country. We celebrated together and sometimes shed a tear together,” Muller said in a farewell video on social media.“When I had the privilege of making my first international appearance, I would never have dreamed of all this. I would like to say thank you to all the fans and my Germany teammates for their support over the years. Take the enthusiasm and joy of this year’s Euros with you.”“Nobody is like Thomas Muller. His value for German football cannot be overestimated,” German national team chief Rudi Voeller said in a statement.“Regardless of whether he’s been with Bayern or the national team for all these years, Thomas has always given every team a face, an exemplary character and a top striker.” \nDefending champions Argentina won a record 16th Copa America title by beating Colombia 1-0 thanks to an extra-time goal from substitute Lautaro Martinez at the Hard Rock Stadium in Florida on Sunday.The game, which was delayed by more than an hour after thousands of fans without tickets tried to enter the stadium, was a cagey affair over 90 minutes but opened up in the extra period.Martinez, the tournament’s leading scorer, latched onto a precise through ball from Giovani Lo Celso before lifting his effort over advancing Colombia goalkeeper Camilo Vargas in the 112nd minute to spark wild celebrations among Argentina fans.Argentina’s latest title comes on the back of their triumphs at the 2022 World Cup and 2021 Copa America, and gives eight-times Ballon d’Or winner Lionel Messi the perfect sendoff in what is likely his last international tournament.Colombia started the match by pressing high up the pitch and Jhon Cordoba hit the post in the seventh minute before Jefferson Lerma and Richard Rios had long-range efforts saved by Argentina goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez.Messi appeared to hurt his ankle in the 36th minute after a collision with Santiago Arias and while he got back to his feet after receiving treatment he was clearly hampered for the remainder of the half.Colombia went on the offensive again in the second half with Arias and Davinson Sanchez coming close to scoring.Argentina soaked up the pressure well but were dealt a blow in the 66th minute when Messi limped off due to the ankle injury.They continued to grew into the contest and had a goal disallowed for offside but Colombia held on as the match went to extra time.The defending champions continued to push forward in extra time, testing Vargas with a shot from Nico Gonzalez before Martinez finally found the breakthrough.Argentina’s win also ended a record 28-match unbeaten streak for Colombia, whose last defeat also came against ‘La Albiceleste’ in February 2022. \nSpain’s Mikel Oyarzabal scored four minutes from time as they capped a dominant Euro 2024 campaign with a deserved 2-1 win over England in Sunday’s showpiece for a record fourth title and condemned their opponents to a second straight final defeat.Oyarzabal finished off a swift counter-attack for the winner after England had fought back from a goal down for the fourth successive match and seemingly earned extra-time.“I have done my job,” said Oyarzabal, who came on for captain Alvaro Morata after 67 minutes. “Just the fact of being in the 26, you value it a lot. It happened to me but could have happened to anyone.”Spain manager Luis de la Fuente added: “I couldn’t be happier. A real team, European champions. I said I was proud and today I am even prouder. It confirms what we are. For me, they are the best in the world.”After a cautious first half where Spain had 65% possession but England’s Phil Foden managed the only shot on target, the Spaniards struck two minutes after the restart, despite losing influential midfielder Rodri to injury at the break.Teenager Lamine Yamal, who had been shackled completely in the first half, finally found space down the right and crossed for Nico Williams to slot home past goalkeeper Jordan Pickford.Spain then enjoyed a purple patch with a series of sharp attacks as England’s previously watertight defence lost its shape and Dani Olmo, Morata and Williams all had good chances.England manager Gareth Southgate sent on Ollie Watkins, the scoring substitute hero of the semi-final, for an ineffective Harry Kane after an hour, with Cole Palmer, England’s most creative player in the last month, joining him 10 minutes later.PAY OFFThe changes paid off almost immediately when Jude Bellingham laid the ball back into Palmer’s path and the substitute curled home a precise low 20-metre shot in the 73rd minute.The massed ranks of England fans, who vastly outnumbered their rivals, exploded and the whole feel of the night changed.But Spain weathered the storm and a lapse of concentration saw England undone as Marc Cucurella was left in space on the left, received the ball from Oyarzabal and drilled it across the box for the substitute to stretch out a toe and poke it home.There was still time for more drama as Spain keeper Unai Simon parried a Declan Rice header from a corner and Dani Olmo then brilliantly headed away Marc Guehi’s follow up on the line.It meant that Spain added a fourth title to those won in 1964, 2008 and 2012 and, as only the third team in the last nine Euros to win the trophy without coming through a shootout at some point in the tournament following France (2000) and Greece (2004), nobody can deny they were worthy winners.For England the “30 years of hurt” after their 1966 World Cup success, which was the soundtrack to their hosting of Euro 96, will now run to at least double that number as they became the first team to lose successive Euro finals“We’ve competed until the very end of the final,” said Southgate, who is widely expected to step down having remarkably led his country to two Euro finals and World Cup semi and quarter-finals in his eight years in charge.“I think we didn’t keep possession of the ball quite well enough. They press you really well and you've got to get out of that pressure and we weren’t able to do that and in the end that meant they had more control of the game“The players have got to take enormous credit for getting us to the point they did. They way they fought and represented the shirt with pride. They were never beaten until the very end, the final five minutes of the last game and then that chance at the end. Just the character and resilience that they’ve shown.“It’s fine margins, but I think they (Spain) were the best team in the tournament and they deserved to win.” \nIsrael struck the southern and central Gaza Strip on Monday to put more pressure on Hamas, following a weekend strike targeting the militant group’s leadership, which killed scores of Palestinians who had sought shelter in a makeshift camp.Two days after the Israeli strike turned a crowded swathe of Mawasi near the Mediterranean coast into a charred wasteland littered with burning cars and mangled bodies, displaced survivors said they had no idea where they should go next.“Those moments as the ground shook underneath my feet and the dust and sand rose to the sky and I saw dismembered bodies - was like nothing I have seen in my life,” said Aya Mohammad, 30, a market seller in Mawasi, reached by mobile text message.“Where to go is what everybody asks, and no one has the answer.”Mawasi on the western outskirts of Khan Younis has been sheltering hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who fled to the area after Israel declared it a safe zone. Israel said its strike there on Saturday targeted Hamas military commander Mohammed Deif, an architect of the October 7 assault on Israeli towns and villages that triggered the Gaza war.The military said it struck an open area, with several buildings and sheds, adding it was a compound run by Hamas and not a tented camp.Palestinian officials say at least 90 people were killed on Saturday and many hundreds wounded. Reuters journalists at the scene filmed carnage, with residents carrying the wounded and dead amid flames and smoke.Further south in Rafah, the main focus of Israel’s advance since May, residents reported renewed fighting on Monday. Israeli forces in western and central parts of the city blew up several homes, they said. Medical officials said they recovered 10 bodies of Palestinians killed by Israeli fire in eastern areas of the city, some of which had already begun to decompose.The military also stepped up aerial and tank shelling in central Gaza in the Al-Bureij and Al-Maghazi historic refugee camps. Health officials said five Palestinians were killed in an Israeli air strike on a house in Maghazi camp.Palestinian health officials said 11 Palestinians were killed in an Israeli air strike on a house in Al-Nuseirat camp in central Gaza Strip earlier on Monday.The Israeli military said the air forces struck dozens of Palestinian military targets across Gaza, killing many gunmen. It said forces killed gunmen in Rafah and central Gaza, sometimes in close combat.A statement from the Al-Quds brigade, the armed wing of the Islamic Jihad militant group, said its fighters were engaged in fierce battles in the Yabna camp in Rafah.Later on Monday, in Deir Al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip, where Israel hasn’t yet invaded and hundreds of thousands have taken refuge, the municipality issued an urgent statement saying it was no longer able to provide 700,000 people in the area with drinking water after running out of fuel.“We urge citizens to preserve what is left in their private tankers and we stress the need to maintain the spirit of cooperation and sharing,” the statement said.Speaking amidst the rubble of his family home in Deir Al-Balah, Walid Thabet told how an Israeli strike earlier on Monday had killed members of his family. Rescue workers and neighbours sifted through the debris to search for survivors buried beneath the wrecked building.“My mother, an elderly woman, was sitting with me upstairs. She went downstairs and after five minutes, I pulled her out from under the rubble. We also pulled my sister out from under the rubble, and my sister’s children too,” said Thabet.“Those who died are my mother, my sister, and my sister’s children. Children! One was two and a half years old, and the other two, I don’t know what happened to them. God willing, may God save them,” he added.CEASEFIRE TALKSSaturday’s carnage in Mawasi, one of the deadliest Israeli strikes of the war, has overshadowed negotiations that both sides had previously described as the closest yet to a lasting ceasefire. A senior Hamas official said on Sunday the group had not walked out of the talks despite the Mawasi strike.Israel says another senior commander was killed in the strike but it has not yet confirmed the fate of Deif. Hamas officials have denied Deif was killed.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Israeli National Security Advisor Tzachi Hanegbi and Israel's Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer in Washington on Monday to discuss “practical solutions that we have in mind” to bridge differences between Israel and Hamas on a ceasefire deal, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said.“I will tell you what we heard directly from two senior advisors to Prime Minister (Benjamin) Netanyahu today, and that is that Israel is still committed to reaching a ceasefire.... There are a few remaining sticking points and we’re working to try and resolve those. We’re committed to trying to do that.”Following the Israeli strike targeting Deif, Blinken expressed “serious concern about the recent civilian casualties in Gaza,” Miller said, adding that Israel had a right to target militants but must do more to reduce civilian casualties.The Gaza health ministry said at least 38,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s military offensive since October 7. It does not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants but officials say most of the dead throughout the war have been civilians.Israel says it has lost 326 soldiers in Gaza and says at least a third of the Palestinian fatalities are fighters.The war began after a Hamas-led attack inside Israel on October 7, by militants who killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took more than 250 hostage to Gaza, according to Israeli authorities.Citing a report by the United Nations Environment Programme, the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA said in a post on X it would take 15 years to clear around 40 million tons of war rubble in Gaza. The effort would need 100+ trucks and cost over $500 million“Debris pose a deadly threat for people in the #GazaStrip as it can contain unexploded ordnance and harmful substances,” it added.The United Nations said on Monday that it will start bringing in more armored vehicles and personal protection equipment for its humanitarian aid operations in the Gaza Strip after receiving approval from Israeli authorities.The UN has long complained of obstacles to getting aid into Gaza - Israel inspects and approves all trucks - and says it is also struggling to distribute aid amid “total lawlessness” within the enclave of 2.3 million people, where a global hunger monitor last month said there is a high risk of famine. \nDonald Trump was in Milwaukee on Monday to make final preparations for the Republican presidential nomination later this week after narrowly escaping an assassination attempt that he said presented an opportunity to bring the country together.Trump, 78, was holding a campaign rally on Saturday in Butler, Pennsylvania - a key state in the Nov. 5 election - when a 20-year-old man with an AR-15-style rifle got close enough to shoot at the former Republican president from a rooftop.One shot hit Trump’s upper right ear, leaving his face streaked with blood, but he was not severely wounded.“That reality is just setting in,” Trump told the Washington Examiner on Sunday. “I rarely look away from the crowd. Had I not done that in that moment, well, we would not be talking today, would we?”One person in the crowd was killed and two others wounded before Secret Service agents fatally shot the suspect.On Sunday, both Trump and President Joe Biden counseled calm and unity in a country whose a deep political divide has grown more pronounced during the presidential race.“There is no place in America for this kind of violence, for any violence ever. Period. No exceptions,” he said. “We can’t allow this violence to be normalized.”“The political rhetoric in this country has gotten very heated. It’s time to cool it down,” Biden said in a televised address from the Oval Office.World leaders condemned the attack, opens new tab, with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer saying he was “appalled by the shocking scenes” and French President Emanuel Macron calling the assassination attempt “a tragedy for our democracies”.Trump pumped his fist in the air several times on Sunday appearing to mouth the words “Fight! Fight! Fight!”, as he descended the stairs from his plane after arriving in Milwaukee, where he will accept his party’s formal nomination at the Republican National Convention on Thursday.“This is a chance to bring the whole country, even the whole world, together. The speech will be a lot different, a lot different than it would’ve been two days ago,” Trump told the Washington Examiner.“I want to try to unite our country,” the New York Post reported Trump saying during the same interview, conducted during the flight to Milwaukee. “But I don’t know if that’s possible. People are very divided.”Biden, a Democrat, ordered an independent review of how the gunman, who was shot dead by agents moments after opening fire, could have taken up an elevated position so close to Trump, who as a former president has lifetime protection by the US Secret Service.Biden and Trump spoke to each other on Saturday night after the shooting.The two are locked in a close election rematch, according to most opinion polls including by Reuters/Ipsos. The shooting on Saturday whipsawed discussion around the presidential campaign, which had been focused on whether Biden, 81, should drop out following a halting June 27 debate performance.Suspect a nursing home aideThe FBI identified Thomas Matthew Crooks of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, as the suspect and said the shooting was being investigated as an attempted assassination.FBI officials said on Sunday that the shooter acted alone.The agency said it had yet to identify an ideology linked to the suspect or any indications of mental health issues or found any threatening language on the suspect’s social media accounts.Crooks was a registered Republican, according to state voter records, and donated $15 to a Democratic political action committee when he was 17. At the time of the shooting, he was employed as a dietary aide at the Bethel Park Skilled Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, which said Crooks’ background check was clean.The gun - an AR-style-5.56 caliber rifle - had been legally bought, said FBI officials, who believed it had been purchased by the suspect’s father.The officials said “a suspicious device” was found in the suspect’s vehicle, which was inspected by bomb technicians and rendered safe.The Secret Service denied accusations by some Trump supporters that it had rejected a campaign request for more security.The shots on Saturday appeared to come from outside the area secured by the Secret Service, the agency said.Spectator killed protecting familyThe rally attendee killed on Saturday was identified by authorities as Corey Comperatore, 50, of Sarver, Pennsylvania. He died trying to protect his family from the hail of bullets, said Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro.Two people wounded in the shooting were in a stable condition on Sunday. Pennsylvania State identified them as David Dutch, 57, of New Kensington, Pennsylvania and James Copenhaver, 74, of Moon Township, Pennsylvania.The attack was the first shooting of a US president or major party presidential candidate since the 1981 attempted assassination of Republican President Ronald Reagan. \nUnauthorized translations of popular international books, including Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin's works, flood Nepal's book market, undermining authors, publishers, and the quality of literature for readers.\nBharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality’s ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via ‘tallo bato’—backdoor route—and that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal. \nPrivate hospitals in major cities in Nepal, including Pokhara, Chitwan, Biratnagar, and Butwal, widely ignore government regulations requiring them to provide free treatment to the needy, leaving patients like Gyanumaya BK in financial hardship, while regulatory bodies fail to enforce compliance.\nThis year’s monsoon arrived on June 11, three days earlier than the usual onset date, bringing rain to the eastern parts of Nepal. However, it didn’t move to the rest of the country, which was reeling under a heat wave with temperatures reaching as high as 44 degrees Celsius for weeks. Most initial rainfall predictions failed, and the monsoon that reached the central parts two weeks later was heavy and destructive. In the early hours of June 26, a mudslide in Lamjung district damaged three houses and killed four people—a 67-year-old man, his daughter-in-law and her two young daughters. By July 6, the monsoon was active throughout the country, causing widespread damage to roads and settlements. Landslides reported in 157 places disrupted vehicular movement on most hill roads. The death toll due to landslides alone reached 53, with 19 others killed by floods. On July 12, debris flow on the Muglin-Narayangarh road pushed two buses into the Trishuli River; of the total 65 passengers in the two buses, three were found alive, five found dead and the rest are missing. These early events illustrate the erratic and unreliable nature of monsoons, as has been expected due to a warmer climate. They are also a cause for concern as these emerging trends have affected our economy and livelihoods and led to increased disaster events. Most of these disasters, like the one in Lamjung, could have been prevented with aptly developed stormwater management strategies that our disaster preparedness initiatives have consistently ignored. The changes The monsoon is gradually changing its intensity, rainfall patterns and timing. On July 8, around 624 mm of rain was measured over a single day in Dodhara of Kanchanpur district. It replaced the 1993 record of 540 mm in 24 hours recorded in Kulekhani. The rainfall events are often localised and dominated by high-intensity, short-duration rain. Even then, when one area gets heavy rain, the adjoining area may remain dry. Such an anomaly is more pronounced in mountainous terrain due to its orographic effects. The conventional rainfall forecast does not capture such variance nor does the data from existing meteorological stations provide adequate and real-time information for analysis and planning. The rainfall pattern has also changed. In a country-wide survey conducted by the National Statistics Office in 2022, about 90 percent of respondents across all geographical regions observed changes in the rainfall pattern between June and September—a similar percent of respondents also saw differences in the rainfall pattern during winter. The monsoon is also shifting northward, bringing rain in areas at higher altitudes like Manang and Mustang districts, which normally get either snow or remain dry during the monsoon. Similar studies conducted in Pakistan to assess such a shift indicated that the monsoons there have also moved northward. The study also stated another worrying concern: This shift has made the southern areas, which previously received normal rain, drier as they get less rain now. A similar trend was also observed in India, where some areas in the Gangetic plains have received less rain. However, areas that were arid in the past, particularly in the western part of the country, have started to receive more rain, causing aberrant floods. Required strategyLocal water sources are crucial for most economic activities, particularly farming and sustaining rivulets and khola. The general understanding of the importance of local water issues has grown in the last decade: How haphazard road construction has increased landslides in the hills, how sealing of surfaces in the plains and drainage congestions have led to a growing scourge of urban flooding or how encroachment in the river banks has compounded flood damage. However, the corrective action required remains very slow compared to the changing pace of rainfall patterns. Instead of considering these budding nuances, our approach to both development in general and infrastructure in particular has consistently ignored them—a cost we are bound to bear in the years ahead. The drainage structures rebuilt to accommodate runoff on the major roads in the capital in the last five years have been proven inadequate to drain rainwater during heavy rains. The conventional agriculture rhythm no longer matches this changing context. The shift is inconveniencing those who have adapted their farming and other economic activities to the usual timing and levels of rain/snow. The rice saplings prepared for plantation in the second half of June, for example, matured and became less productive when the rains arrived late for transplantation. Those who planted the right-age saplings on time by pumping water also lost crops when the rain came late due to a dry spell in between. To avoid this threat to our food security and farmers’ economic prospects, it’s time we matched the agricultural rhythm to the changing monsoonal pattern.Engaging the youth Changes in the monsoon are likely to be more pronounced in the years ahead. Unless we enhance our capacity to manage water at the local level, we’re bound to suffer. Hydrological analysis in this altered context requires substantial decentralised data because rainfall’s localised nature often becomes runoff and fails to enter the subsurface to replenish soil moisture and aquifers. In this regard, an example of a community-driven initiative started by the state government of Kerala, India, is worth considering. To generate rainfall data that was as decentralised as possible, they have installed well-equipped weather stations in over 270 government schools in the state and trained students to record changes in rain and temperature to help them understand rainfall anomalies and adopt necessary measures for water management. Kerala’s community-driven initiative to engage, train and empower the decision-makers of tomorrow is an excellent way of ensuring a deeper appreciation of changing rainfall patterns across geographical zones and helping build appropriate strategies to meet local needs. Assisting schools in installing weather stations to monitor rainfall and recognising local water issues will provide future decision-makers with an encompassing awareness of the evolving nature of monsoons and formulate strategies, including affordable and actionable tactics to manage water at the local level. Youth engagement can be further reinforced by introducing practical classes as part of the curriculum on building water harvesting structures, such as small ponds, and monitoring their progress periodically while they’re in school. This will help them gain invaluable knowledge about rainfall, local hydrology and understanding how managing rainwater is, in fact, crucial to sustaining our lives and our environment in a warmer world.  \nNepali politics is full of absurdities. If governmental stability is boring and nauseating, instability is a pastime for politicians. The more we observe Nepali politics, the more it looks like a pantomime or what we call nautanki. All such manoeuvrings and manipulations, aided and abetted by high-sounding rhetoric of stability and progress, are, in fact, leading the country nowhere. Politics is becoming uglier each day, resulting in stagnation and uncertainty. Moreover, the political parties’ leaders do not hesitate to call such grotesque doings democratic exercises. The latest event is the sudden change of alliances between the CPN (UML) and the Maoist Centre. Now, KP Sharma Oli has joined hands with the Nepali Congress’s (NC) Deuba to exchange the post of prime minister at intervals. The 10-year Maoist insurgency in Nepal ultimately landed in a hostile environment the Maoist Party had always denounced as inappropriate for the country. For the Maoists, the violent revolution à la Maoist variant was the apotheosis of transformation and progress. In its wake, the 2005-06 revolution paid rich dividends to the Maoist leaders by catapulting them into the high stage of Nepali politics, making them the first party in the first Constituent Assembly elections held in 2008 and enabling them to head the government. However, its first stint in government was short-lived when it miscalculated and overstretched its strength. The haste with which it tried to grab power by entering the domain of the Nepal Army turned out to be counterproductive. Here, the president’s constitutional role was extended to refusing the recommendation of the prime minister to fire the chief of the army staff, resulting in the ouster of the prime minister in less than 10 months. Any politician who forgets the surface of political reality is destined to fall, and it happened to comrade Pushpa Kamal Dahal, whose long schooling in Maoist ideology and practices of war didn’t work in the most inhospitable context of Nepali politics and society.Moreover, Leninism and Maoism espoused by the communist parties—Leninism for the CPN (UML) and Maoism for the Maoist Centre—are neither tenable nor practicable, as the revolution launched by the latter landed in a compromise with its own ‘class enemies’ and ‘reactionaries’. It was indeed a U-turn for Dahal and his colleagues. The CPN (UML) metamorphosed when it suddenly changed its chrysalis into a multiparty system in 1990. Originating from the Jhapa violent movement that adopted Marxist-Leninist Maoist ideology, it eventually joined the restoration of the multiparty movement launched under the stewardship of the NC and subsequently became a systemic party. Now, all the parties subscribe to the multiparty system, albeit with various banners and rhetoric. Still, in substance, they are co-sharers of power and privileges with the much-denounced NC. Originating and evolving as the first liberal party, the NC has the credentials of being a believer in liberal democracy, notwithstanding the deficiencies of this ideology. Now, the NC, like others, is also in the quagmire of dirty politics, indulging in making and breaking alliances forged as a result of the fractured electoral mandate handed down to them. Yet, despite heavy odds encountered by the parties in the past, all of them (including the NC) have a tendency to disfigure the beautiful edifice of republican order. Although their perseverance and dedication to presenting a constitution prepared by the CA was/is commendable, the manner in which they are bent on destroying the spirit of the republic is equally despicable. All their activities are carried out in the name of stability and progress, under the subterfuge of regression and backlash. The democracy we have adopted did not develop by fits and starts as it did in Britain and the Netherlands. These two countries have been able to sustain democracy without giving rise to occasional upheavals that upset democratic stability. Unlike them, France’s top-down approach didn’t allow democracy to strike roots or provide stability. Thus, Britain remains an exception to many other aspirants to democracy. What went wrong with Nepal’s democratic experience? The answers are many and wide-ranging. First, the ideological moorings and orientations of political parties are spurious. Since many come from opposite ideological orientations and actions, it has taken a long time for them to internalise political culture. Even the NC, the so-called grand old party of liberal democracy, has derailed the system by making unholy alliances to remain in power. Although no party can become a purist in today’s political churnings, the NC could have become a role model in laying the foundation of democracy. But its leaders are as self-seeking as others. In the post-1990 multiparty era and under the present Republican dispensation, the NC has failed to show its distinct identity, rather indulging in self-aggrandisement and misgovernance. Changes of governments under any pretext and parroting the rhetoric of democratic credibility would not suffice in the uncanny political context. The second is the crisis of leadership. Most parties’ leaders have been tested by people who perceive them as lacking vision, commitment and determination to advance the agendas of progress. The same leaders who have forfeited public trust are lured by the posts and power. They have allowed the system to rot by indulging in pastime politics, rendering the people silent spectators. Leaders are generally neither transformatory nor honest while discharging their duties in government and opposition. Since leadership is a crucial variable in the early phase of political evolution and change in all dimensions, Nepali leaders even fail to be transactional. They take pride in becoming prime ministers many times without leaving behind the imprints of their governance. Third, the absurdity is begotten by the failures to put institutions on track, as many institutions created by the constitution or others outside it are spoiled by excessive politicisation in the respective parties’ lines. So, institutions are virtually lifeless and hardly generate the popular faith in leadership with which the system needs to revolve. Finally, experiences over the years have shown that opportunistic politics do not allow coalition governments to last for a fixed term because Nepali parties are not made for coalition politics. \nAccording to recent statistics from the World Bank (2023), the unemployment rate among the youth labour force (ages 15-24) in Nepal is 21 percent, a slight increase from 20 percent in 2017. This rate is higher than the regional average. Additionally, older statistics from the International Labour Organisation indicate that approximately 26.1 percent of university graduates in Nepal are unemployed. Most of these graduates are employed in routine jobs. With the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI), many of these positions are at risk of being replaced by AI and automation. As it is often said, \"AI won’t replace humans, but humans with AI will replace humans without AI.” Despite this precarious situation, Nepal is home to an aspirational youth population eager to establish themselves in the growing domestic and foreign economies. These youths need employable skills relevant to today's digital and AI-driven world to climb the economic ladder.As global digitalisation and the adoption of AI and data science transform various sectors, the demand for new skill sets is increasing both nationally and internationally. Organisations are becoming more AI-driven, rendering many traditional job roles obsolete. Consequently, students worldwide must acquire AI skills to remain competitive in the future job market. This trend is particularly relevant for Nepal's Higher Education Institutions (HEIs), where there is a significant data science and AI skills gap. Data science combines mathematics, statistics, specialised programming, advanced analytics, AI and machine learning to uncover actionable insights hidden within organisational data. Based on our interactions with students and corporate entities in Nepal, this piece examines the pressing need to integrate data science and AI into Nepal’s HEIs curriculum. Given the low employability rate among university graduates in Nepal, it is imperative to equip them with these essential skills. Best practicesAddressing these issues requires significant interventions at both policy and strategic levels. India's example reveals a massive impetus from government and private stakeholders on AI skilling over the past several years. Numerous skilling programmes on data science are available in India, ranging from secondary schooling to doctoral levels. Under government initiatives like Skill India, large-scale programmes have been completed and are ongoing to reskill and upskill the workforce in these areas. For instance, many Indian states have introduced Python programming as a compulsory or elective course in secondary school curricula to expose young minds to AI and data skills. Likewise, AI-related courses are going to be added to China’s education system, including primary and secondary schools.What needs to be doneA similar curriculum intervention is necessary in Nepal to cultivate young Nepali minds with data and programming skills for future AI roles. Currently, only a few top-notch business schools in Nepal have incorporated Python coding into their curriculum. However, this practice is not widespread. For undergraduate and graduate curricula across all professional HEI courses in Nepal, introducing data science skills in applied statistics, R programming, Python programming, SQL, data visualisation (using tools like Tableau), machine learning, and deep learning is essential. Additionally, each data science course should include at least one compulsory industry guest lecture (physical or online) from AI or data science experts, whether from Nepal or globally. This will ensure that students know the latest AI trends relevant to the industry.Furthermore, there should be more industry-academia collaborative projects wherein industries can offer real-time data science challenges to students through physical and virtual hackathons. From the perspective of skilling HEI educators, upskilling and Faculty Development Programmes (FDP) should be organised to familiarise them with the latest data science and AI tools. Such programmes should be incentivised to motivate educators to engage actively and learn from these opportunities. Educators skilled in these programmes should be encouraged to work on research projects connecting AI to their field of expertise, with the aim of filing patents or copyrights or publishing them in reputable journals. As the world transitions from Industry 3.0 to Industry 4.0 and soon to Industry 5.0, Nepal must also move its industrial and economic sectors in the same direction using AI and data science.Implementing these interventions would gradually build a culture of AI, data science, and innovation among Nepal's student community, addressing the existing skill gap. Moreover, such initiatives would foster the growth of AI-powered startups in Nepal, providing solutions for various socio-economic and business challenges. Nepal's recent launch of a concept paper on the application and practice of AI is a welcome move. However, it is crucial to formulate how AI can be integrated into the curriculum to ensure that future graduates possess the necessary skills.In conclusion, by incorporating data science and AI into HEIs, Nepal can better prepare its students for the uncertain future job market and foster innovation and economic growth. \nPrime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is all set to go today. After being taken for a ride turn-by-turn by a distant third CPN (Maoist Centre) led by Dahal, the two big parties in Parliament—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—have joined hands to form a coalition government. And with this, Dahal, who remained at or around the power centre for almost a decade even with his party performing poorly in polls, is pushed to the periphery—at least for a while. The overzealous commentaries about Dahal being thrown off the grid of power may, however, be premature. As per the current constitutional provisions, coalition culture is here to stay. And considering how adamant the political parties are in sticking to their morally corrupt politics, no one can tell if the impending Congress-UML coalition stays for the next three months or three years. As Dahal goes today, there does not seem to be much point assessing how well his coalition with the UML fared in just four months of its existence. It takes decades, even centuries, to build a nation. The five-year term of Parliament is the minimum required for a set of leaders to make some impactful decisions for the country. There certainly are provisions for changes in the government, even in the midst of the parliamentary term, but these should be exceptional cases. What we have got, however, is a perpetuity of the coalition culture. It is this perpetuity that has halted the nation-building process for decades now. With the same set of three old men playing the hot potato game around power, nation-building has become a staccato performance at best. Just as one performer comes to the stage and starts his performance, he is pushed to the sidelines in the middle of the act.Pushpa Kamal Dahal will perform the last scene of the four-month act that was his coalition. He will come on stage, search for UML chairperson KP Sharma Oli among the audience, and call him a betrayer. He will then look for the Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba and blame him for being power-hungry. Oli and Deuba will then take the stage by turns and blame Dahal for trying to take them for fools. Such acts have been repeatedly performed, with the same set of plots, performances and actors. There is certainly a new actor on the block, a television presenter who thought he had had enough of shouting out of the small screen. He stepped out of the screen into the field and competed with the old guards whose noses he wanted to break—as his infamous saying went.The moment Rabi Lamichhane came to the spotlight after an impressive electoral showing, the masks he had worn all along started falling off. After a while, he became the fourth old man in the club of politicians who see fault in everyone else besides themselves. Only that Lamichhane was louder, more contemptuous of the media, and as directionless as the other three when it came to envisioning a future for the nation. As Dahal is forced to step down and Oli is about to take the helm, it is worth pondering if this sordid cycle of drama will end anytime soon.  \nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has recently come under fire, both in India and abroad, for hugging Russian President Vladimir Putin even as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine shows no sign of ceasing. As expected, among the fiercest critics of the infamous hug is Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who called it a “huge disappointment and a devastating blow to peace efforts”. As Putin continues to be made a pariah by the Western world for his continued attack on Ukraine, India under Modi has made it clear that the world’s largest democracy cares more about the India-Russia military-industrial complex than international humanitarian concerns. Ordinary Indians do not seem to care about the intricacies of the Modi-Putin deal for arms trade. But they certainly do about the fact that Modi has convinced Putin to return the Indians who have been fighting Russia’s war against Ukraine. Like Nepalis, Indians, too, have been lured into joining the Russian Army. Like the Nepalis, Indian recruits have realised that the war is no walk in the park, that their agents sold them false dreams, and they now want to return home. Like the Nepalis, the Indians, too, have been killed in the senseless war, although in lesser numbers. According to Indian media, at least four Indians have been killed, while between 30 and 40 others are serving in the Russian Army. In contrast, a staggering 35 Nepalis have been killed in the war, while around 150 are still on the battlefield, waiting for the Nepali state to intervene and ensure their homecoming. Apart from returning those alive, Russia has also offered to expedite compensation to the families of the deceased Indian recruits. This is in sharp contrast to the fate of the deceased Nepalis, whose families have yet to receive any compensation. It has been months since the families of the fallen Nepalis started lobbying, demonstrating and organising sit-ins to put pressure on the government to take up the matter with its Russian counterpart. Government officials, including various foreign ministers, have claimed to be coordinating with Russian officials to repatriate the Nepali recruits. But the results are for all to see: Russia has turned a deaf ear to all such pleas.Notably, the recent agreement between Modi and Putin, which has yet to be made public, is the result of continuous homework by Indian government officials rather than just an outcome of Modi’s dinnertime charm offensive with Putin. The Indian Embassy in Moscow was consistently raising this issue. Likewise, Foreign minister S. Jaishankar was making a strong case for it in his meeting with the Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation in Astana, Kazakhstan, last week. This shows how the Indian government has been using multiple channels to ensure the repatriation of its citizens. Having faced almost 10 times the number of Indian casualties, Nepal’s plight is comparatively more dire. Nepal must, therefore, double up its efforts by putting diplomatic pressure, even using Russia’s allies, including India, to expedite the return of the Nepalis. First, Nepal must again summon the Russian ambassador to Nepal, Aleksei Novikov, and make him answerable for Russia’s failure to repatriate Nepali citizens becoming collateral damages in its senseless war with Ukraine. Of course, we don’t expect Pushpa Kamal Dahal and his government to wield the kind of diplomatic clout of Modi and his country, the fifth largest economy in the world. What galls is that the Nepali state has been unable to harness even its limited diplomatic apparatus for such a noble and urgent cause.  \nAs much as we love the monsoon for its greenery and promise of a bountiful harvest, we dread floods, landslides and diseases. As in years past, disasters have wreaked havoc in several parts of Nepal this year too, leading to at least 70 deaths since June. Adding to the woes are vector- and water-borne diseases, such as viral fever, diarrhoea, dysentery, food poisoning, typhoid, dengue and kala-azar, turning the season into a time of epidemics. The Epidemiology and Disease Control Division has already warned doctors and the public of possible uptick in incidents of these diseases.In 2022, as a result of contaminated water, Kathmandu Valley saw an outbreak of cholera, with 77 positive cases reported. The same year, diarrheal diseases affected hundreds of people for many months. Just last month, a patient tested positive for the Vibrio cholerae 01 Ogawa serotype at the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital, of which the authorities were reportedly unaware, as per a Post report. This is not a good sign, as many cases usually go unreported because people don’t visit hospitals unless there’s an emergency, and a lack of investigation from the government means no awareness about the possible spread of cholera. Such negligence about a deadly disease will only fuel its spread.Moreover, the dengue outbreak in the country has gone out of hand over the years. According to official records, the virus has circulated to 73 districts, infecting almost 1,500 people since January. What is concerning is that these numbers could go up, as we aren’t even halfway through this monsoon, and the dengue virus lasts until post-monsoon. Additionally, climate change and rising temperatures have pushed the disease even into the winter season. Recently, health experts have also been worried about the possible instances of the Zika virus (similar to dengue) in Nepal, as cases are being detected in the southern neighbour India. The outbreaks of these diseases and their prolonged presence can easily drain the healthcare facilities of an under-resourced country like ours. In the monsoon crisis, the poor and vulnerable suffer the most, as their condition is compounded by contaminated water, floods, landslides, and other monsoon-related disasters. This not only affects their treatment-seeking behaviour but also their ability to adopt preventive measures, which could in turn lead to community-level transmission of diseases.The Epidemic and Outbreak Surveillance of the Ministry of Health is tasked with collecting data on diseases, informing the general public, and encouraging policymakers to take necessary actions against outbreaks and make people aware of them. Moreover, it also regularly monitors drinking water quality and does surveillance of water-borne diseases. In recent months, it has found harmful substances like faecal coliform in bottled water and even tap water in some places in the Kathmandu Valley. These findings suggest the surveillance and monitoring mechanism in the country has to be strengthened, and local units around the country should be made responsible for keeping their water resources safe throughout the year, especially during the monsoon, to prevent possible outbreaks of water-borne diseases. In the case of vector-borne dengue, Zika and chikungunya viruses, a year-round door-to-door search and destruction of mosquito breeding areas is a must.Nepal has been dealing with monsoon maladies for decades. Our healthcare system should proactively allocate human, infrastructural and budgetary resources to combat these monsoon epidemics and prevent unnecessary loss of life and a whole lot of suffering.  \nThe July 1 midnight deal between the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, the first and the second largest parties in the federal lower house respectively, turned national politics on its head. Pushpa Kamal Dahal was thrown out as prime minister and KP Oli assumed the country’s leadership. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asked Maoist Centre leader Ram Karki, who has cultivated an image of a rebel within the party, on his reading of the event. How do you see the CPN-UML’s rebuffing of the CPN (Maoist Centre) and formation of a new government with the Nepali Congress?If you see it from the perspective of those who believe in parliamentary democracy, this is wrong. In the system, the largest party is believed to have the public mandate to run the government and the second-biggest to be the main opposition. A weak opposition makes for a weak parliamentary system. The system isn’t an ideal one for us [communists]. The two parties have made a mockery of the system they advocate for. Why didn’t the Maoist party that championed progressive agendas implement them when in government?We should admit that we lost the moral authority to implement and execute those agendas. We could have implemented those ideals by mobilising peasants, working-class groups, and people from oppressed communities, but our grip and connection with them have loosened.Why did the party and the leadership distance itself from the working class?The state has two arms—coercive and persuasive. The Maoists succeeded in using coercive force. But you can’t use this all the time. One has to use persuasive force most of the time. When we joined mainstream politics, we were the leading political force. We were in power. At the time we should have changed our education sector. For that, we should have worked on our curriculum and trained teachers. Our educational system is guided by patriarchal and feudal values. We need to orient people to questioning and following science. The party couldn’t do so. Had we done so, we would now have a critical mass with us. The Maoist leaders lost the moral ground. When you preach lofty ideas, the public won’t listen to you. They instead watch your lifestyle. Earlier, the Congress and the UML leaders, who were outsiders in Kathmandu, got ‘polluted’ when they worked in collusion with the capital’s elites. We, too, got ‘polluted’ by hobnobbing with the two parties. The working class and oppressed communities that had helped the Maoist party fight the state felt betrayed. The leaders and the masses are separated now. The Maoist party was the true leader of the progressive agenda such as inclusion, federalism, secularism and republicanism. These ideas are still valid, but the party failed to honour them. It failed because it lost its strength and disconnected itself from the class it fought for. It tried to become the leader of all people. The oppressed communities felt betrayal, while the other classes didn’t accept the party because of our past. Do you think the Congress and the UML will try to undermine progressive agendas enshrined in the new constitution?They have also sold lofty ideas to the people in the past. A counter-revolution under the two parties’ leadership is not easy. Their rank and file won’t accept it. The Congress, in fact, is not only a political party but a collective where you find radical Hindus as well as hardcore secularists. It stays strong as long as it works as a unified force of various groups. But when it imitates communists and tries to be a rigid cadre-based party, it loses its space and strength. So the Congress can’t lead a counter-revolution against progressive ideas. Counter-revolution is not easy, but the reactionary forces have certainly succeeded in regaining their space.Observers and politicians from rival parties claim that the Maoist Centre is now in an existential crisis. Do you think it can make a comeback?More importantly, the space that used to be occupied by the Maoist party is now left unoccupied.Can’t the UML or other forces make inroads into that space?The UML is a tried and tested force. Even the Maoist Centre is now described as a tested force. How can older forces enter that space? A force mightier than the Maoists can emerge. As a Maoist party member, I still vow to rejuvenate and revive the Maoist Centre. I am trying to convince my fellow comrades to do that. But my voice hasn’t prevailed. I have been presenting my papers in the party’s general conventions. We still have a strong belief that sooner or later, we will prevail because we are raising valid issues.Various leftist groups have at various times tried to create a strong, united left political force in Nepal. Do you think ideas like socialism and communism still attract the youth?Some rebel voices within our parties take some initiatives to raise our collective voice to build pressure on party establishments. But this has been limited to theoretical debates and failed to translate into politics. A theory or philosophy is like an iron plate, while crafting a tool from that iron is politics. We haven’t been able to transform our ideas into political action. If a leader floats a political agenda, the people first study the leader’s integrity. If a leader with a strong moral authority proposes an idea, people trust and follow it. If Gandhi was wearing a suit and telling people to wear handwoven khadi, Indian people wouldn’t have followed him. Similarly, if Mao was using clothes, watches and vehicles from developed countries while preaching for simplicity, Chinese people wouldn’t have followed him.Our people don’t listen to our leaders because they don’t see the leaders walk the talk. Youths are always attracted by adventurism; they are receptive and sensitive to certain incidents. Now, they aren’t following us because they don’t find any adventure and newness in our ideas. If we do some soul searching and correct ourselves, the Maoist Centre still can lead the process to complete the unfinished progressive agendas. Is that possible under the current Maoist leadership that has lost its credibility while staying in power for long? Will the people trust them?People will judge them based on their actions. If the Maoist leaders were more credible, there would be no space for the Congress and UML to come together. Either one or the other force would seek the Maoist party’s support. They wouldn’t have dared to ignore the Maoist party that led progressive issues in the recent past. They were emboldened because of the Maoists’ diminishing influence. Therefore, we have to correct ourselves in practice.You said that the classes and communities the Maoist party used to lead now have no leader. Can new outfits occupy that space?The traditional parties—the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre–don’t have any strategic vision on where they want to see the country in 20 years. The new forces are worse. They hit a ball and wherever it reaches, shift the goalpost there. They carry the goalpost with them. New forces with such visions can’t replace old parties. History shows that Nepal has witnessed political upheavals in a gap of 10-15 years. In the past such tsunamis have changed the political systems. Now we have seen sparks of movements but they are scattered. New forces need an ideological weapon. The Maoists forgot to sharpen their ideological weapon over time by holding ideological debates and upgrading themselves. Another is intra-party democracy. A political party that doesn’t practise intra-party democracy can’t enforce democracy in society.From the perspectives of intra-party democracy, the Maoist Centre is probably the most undemocratic of major political forces. Why?In the Congress, you are free to speak, but you don’t have a say in execution. Communist parties are too centralised. The structure conceptualised around a century ago in the context of wars and other contexts hasn’t been updated. Even new parties are run by the party chiefs imitating the anomalies of traditional forces. A leader is praised if s/he takes immediate decisions, gets them endorsed from the party committees and implements them swiftly. Those who say they have to first discuss the issue in party committees are described as weak. Such a trend is killing intra-party democracy.Do you think the Congress-UML coalition will succeed?A coalition between the parties that don’t even have a common minimum programme is a coalition of opportunists. They don’t have a moral ground either. On ideological grounds, the Congress still cites the late BP Koirala because no other leader of the party has worked on the theoretical front for decades. Such is also the situation with communists. They still cite the theoretical works of the late Pushpa Lal Shrestha. The current alliance is not a principled one, it’s a collaboration between opportunists. So, don’t expect anything better.How do you evaluate the outgoing government?It did nothing for the class it represents. The prime minister’s secretariat might have prepared a list of ‘100 important achievements of the government’. But what is the government’s priority? It failed to even give skills to those going abroad in search of work. They would have found better work had we given them valuable skills. Not only the outgoing one but all the previous governments have failed. The Congress-UML alliance has said it wants to review the constitution and amend the charter when necessary. How do you see this idea?This will be backtracking from the present constitutional roadmap. It is dishonest to create hindrance in implementing the federal system and then suggest the system is a burden. Such moves would give space to those who want to raise questions on republic and secular systems. There is a strong faction that lobbies for Hindutwa in the Nepali Congress. It is no secret that the Congress and the UML were not in favour of republic, secular and federal systems. But later, they rode the popular wave. But they have still not internalised it, and there are some regressive elements in both the parties but the people, who have come too far, won’t backtrack.Don’t you think the coming together of Congress and UML may ensure political stability?Instability is okay for me because stability may not necessarily be good for a country like ours. See, a single leader has been ruling a party continuously for over 30 years. What if they rule the country in a similar way? Look at some countries where a single leader has ruled for decades. The current arrangement is better than such stability.Will the Maoist party chairman and prime minister, who didn’t even appoint a minister from a Dalit community, have the moral authority to again champion the agenda of the oppressed?Appointing a minister is again an ornamental approach to appease certain communities. What we should do is ensure the participation of oppressed communities in policymaking.But party chair Dahal may again seek ways to get back to power. Will he pay attention to these issues?We should stop this chase for power at all cost. We will say this in our party meetings. We should accept the reality that we have just 32 seats and so we won’t get sufficient space to implement any important programmes even if we join the government.The way your party chief remained in power for over 18 months using various tactics, was it right?If you see it through a parliamentarian’s lens, it looks quite smart. If you see it through a Marxist perspective, just becoming a prime minister is futile if you can’t implement your policies and strengthen republicanism and participatory democracy. \nThe Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML last week reached an agreement to form a coalition government under the leadership of UML chair KP Sharma Oli. As a part of the package, they also aim to make certain changes to the constitution. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asked Pradeep Gyawali, deputy general secretary of UML, the reasons behind the coming together of the two largest parties, how they plan to run the government and to review and amend the constitution.Many are seeing the Congress-UML alliance as something unusual. What factors brought the two largest parties together even as there is no crisis-like situation or a special task such as constitution writing?Definitely, in normal parliamentary practice, the two largest parties don’t forge an alliance to run a government. The party that gets the biggest mandate leads the government, and the other big party remains in the opposition to make the ruling force accountable. In Nepal, the country’s two major forces, the Congress and the UML, have also joined hands in certain junctures for certain purposes. They worked together to make the constitution in 1990, to conduct general elections in 1999, to complete transition after the 2006 people’s movement and to bring out the constitution in 2015. We felt a need for a similar collaboration this time around. After the November 2022 elections, we saw three alliances in our parliament. At first, Maoist Centre chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal became prime minister with our support, but he failed to abide by the agreement sincerely. He changed the coalition within a month. The subsequent alliance between the Congress and the Maoist Centre lasted for a year. He again sought the UML’s support. Within four months of the March 4 deal with the UML, he started yet another gameplan to join hands with the Congress under the pretext of forming a national consensus government. It was quite unusual for the prime minister himself to instigate instability in the government. He publicly boasted that he had a ‘magical number’ [32 seats in the House of Representatives]. He thought that he could employ the tactic of ‘use and throw’ with the two largest parties and rule the country for the full term. He was completely indifferent to people’s plight, the country’s pressing issues and service delivery. This was the height of irresponsibility. So, the UML and Congress leaders concluded that the time had come to intervene to ensure political stability and service delivery and make sure public frustration doesn’t get out of hand. Did external factors play a role? Recent statements by UML leaders suggest that the party has taken it seriously. When national forces are weak, the neighbouring countries and international forces become more cautious, even more so given Nepal’s geo-political situation. Some of their concerns are valid. They fear political instability in Nepal may have an adverse impact on their genuine issues. We have to take this naturally. Second, it is no secret that we have a long legacy of facing external interference. Sometimes such interventions are carried out covertly and sometimes overtly. Therefore, national forces should be strong. Some political parties and leaders have a tendency of seeking external forces’ support to fulfil their vested interests. In return, they serve the external forces’ undue interests. Formation of a government is a purely domestic affair, but in our case sometimes it also becomes an issue of geopolitical interest. It is said that the UML was spooked when it learned that Prime Minister Dahal had reportedly approached the Congress for a new alliance. This reportedly happened after Dahal returned from New Delhi following Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s swearing-in.We were taken by surprise when the Congress leaders told us that the prime minister had reached out to them with a proposal to form a national consensus government. We were informed about the development from the leaders of the main opposition party. When we reached the March 4 deal with the prime minister, we thought he came to us with a commitment to course correction. Based on that, we supported him almost unconditionally. We didn’t bargain while sharing ministerial portfolios and didn’t talk about the prime minister’s term. We had even thought of allowing Dahal to run the government for the full term if the government functioned well and people were satisfied. We hadn’t even imagined that we would have to think about changing the coalition within four months.We definitely had certain grievances such as a lack of consultation with our party and our lawmakers while preparing the government’s policies and programmes and while allocating budget. Our party chair brought up this issue with the prime minister. But our concerns weren’t addressed. They had already started to ignore us. There were several issues with the prime minister, but we were committed to the partnership. But they had already gone too far. Fortunately, the Congress leaders didn’t accept the offer and instead raised critical questions about the rationale behind the proposal. Basically, the Congress didn’t trust Prachanda ji [Dahal] and came to us. It concluded that Dahal didn’t come with the intent of solving the country’s problems but to manoeuvre between the Congress and the UML.Besides jointly running the government, constitution amendment is another major aspect of the latest Congress-UML deal. What are the provisions the parties want to change?There are four major objectives of this agreement. Safeguarding national interest; strengthening economy; improving governance and service delivery; and ensuring political stability. A debate has started that some constitutional provisions are not helping maintain political stability. What we have said is that it’s been almost a decade since the promulgation of this constitution. Some of its provisions are yet to be implemented. On the other hand, provincial governments complain that they have not been able to work in a full-fledged way because the federal government has still not made some laws they need. So, first, we will undertake a comprehensive review on the progress in the course of implementing the constitution and the challenges we faced in the past decade, among other things. While doing so, we will find out if there are provisions that have posed challenges in maintaining political stability and running a stable government and suggest amendments accordingly.So, it’s not only about the amendment but also about review, assessment and recommendation for amendment, if there is a need. Even if the amendment process begins, it will be limited to ensuring political stability and won’t touch other aspects of the statute. There is no need to over-react. For instance, some Maoist leaders are trying to make it a political issue by describing it as a regressive move. That is wrong.So as per the two-party deal, the statute will be reviewed but not necessarily amended?Yes, whether to go for amendments will depend on the findings of the review. No constitution in the world is perfect. Its success largely depends on the practitioners. So, first we have to differentiate between the role of the constitution and the practitioners. It is true that our society is divided over certain provisions of our constitution. All these issues will be considered, but the fundamental features of the constitution such as democracy, inclusion and federalism won’t be altered. Our priority would be to only remove hindrances in making the system more functional, people-oriented and productive.Of late, people are debating the electoral system, provincial structure and secularism. Will these issues also be dealt with?Federalism is a new system for us. In fact, it is still an in-the-making process in Nepal. We have to note some timelines while analysing the performance of provinces. After the provincial and federal elections in 2017, the first provincial governments were formed in 2018, and they worked for around three years in a stable way. With small cabinets, they worked genuinely to strengthen the provincial system. At the time, most provincial cabinets had around six to seven ministers. They weren’t severely criticised at the time. The wrong trends in the provinces started with the division of the then Nepal Communist Party and the fall of the NCP-led governments at the centre as well as provinces. We saw the trend of horse-trading in provinces. Small parties made unjustified bargaining for ministerial portfolios, chief ministers started splitting ministries and increasing the number of ministers in their cabinets. Also, the November 2022 polls again gave a fragmented verdict, further augmenting the instability and anomalies at the provincial level. So, the problem is the way we are handling things more than the provincial structures. The time isn’t ripe to seek an alternative to the provinces. As far as the electoral model is concerned, we included proportional electoral (PR) system after long debates and discussions. Based on three general elections held after 1990, a conclusion was drawn that the first-past-the-post (FPTP) model couldn’t properly represent the historically under-represented sections. The premise is still valid. Based on the achievements, we may exclude certain communities from the list. But that time hasn’t come. Two questions raised over the use of PR are valid. Is the system really doing justice to the strata and class of the society for which it was introduced? This is the question not about the PR system but the leaders who use it. Similarly, some questions: Is proportional representation required in executive as well because representation is basically vital for policy making? The forms and modalities of the PR system might be discussed, but no one has even thought of removing the inclusive system.Similar is the case with secularism. The spirit is to make the state patron of all religions in the country. However, some sections of society have often tried to misuse and misinterpret the new constitutional provision. They try to interpret secularism as openly allowing rampant religious conversion, and some have made it an excuse to attack the age-old Sanatan faith. For instance, if the President or prime minister visits Lumbini, gurudwara or a shrine of any other faith on certain occasions, that is taken positively, but when they visit Pashupatinath Temple, a section of people raise questions. These activities have made some people think that these attacks on our Sanatan faith are taking place because of the secular system. There is no problem in the constitutional provision because the statute added an explanatory note that states, “‘secular’ means religious, cultural freedoms, including protection of religion and culture handed down from time immemorial.” But some extremist activities have given wrong impressions.Some experts believe the problem of fragmented mandate can be addressed by increasing the threshold required for a political party to be eligible to get PR seats, which can be done by amending laws. Will the Congress-UML alliance opt for this?Yes, this is one feasible option. I am in favour of this. As per the existing provision, a political party can secure seats under the PR category by securing 3 percent votes in the federal parliament and 1.5 percent votes in provincial assemblies. If a political organisation doesn’t even represent 5 or 7 or 10 percent of the population, what can they contribute to the country? You do politics to represent a sizable population and get a public mandate. Otherwise, the presence of such groups would only promote unreasonable bargaining and instigate instability in governments. This can be one of the agenda of the discussion between the two parties.This time, leaders have made it transparent that chiefs of the two parties will lead the government on a rotational basis. But why have other details of the agreement not been made public?There hasn’t been topic-wise discussions on specific provisions. The broader understanding is to review and assess the implementation aspect of the constitution and move ahead based on the findings of the assessment. We have also made it clear that such an act will be guided only by the objective of ensuring political stability and we will not go beyond that. Who will undertake this type of constitution review?We haven’t worked on it in detail. We haven’t reached any understanding. Naturally, inputs will be taken from the constitution makers, experts on constitutional law and politicians involved in this field. But no decision has been made on its nitty-gritty.The Rastriya Prajatantra Party that wants to revive the Hindu kingdom was the first party to welcome the Congress-UML deal while the Maoist Centre has accused Congress and UML of making a regressive move. So don’t you think this affair is tricky?I don’t think the political parties will touch the issues that the RPP talks about, such as reinstatement of Hindu kingdom and dissolution of federalism. No one is thinking about that. Also, the questions raised by the Maoist leaders have no meaning. They are only trying to make a political agenda.It also seems that the Congress and the UML floated this idea of reviewing the constitution to make a case for the two largest parties to form the government.That’s not true. This question undermines the spirit of this agreement. If this system fails, people will raise questions mainly to the leaders of the Congress and the UML, not Prachanda. It’s not only about running the government. We were already in the government and it isn’t a big deal for the Congress to return to power. If democracy fails, the democratic forces will lose the most. So we are genuinely working on this. The Congress and the UML are historical rival forces in Nepali politics. How can the two work together in government?It is true that the Congress and the UML are the two major competitors of this country. But we have some converging factors. First, we both believe in a broader democratic framework. Sometimes, the Congress may give more emphasis on liberal values while we may push for more socialism-oriented programmes. But the common ground is democratic values. We also have the experience of successfully carrying out certain tasks jointly. We may have some friction but we also have experience of managing bitter intra-party fighting as well as inter-party rivalry.How will the ministerial portfolios be shared in the new coalition?We haven’t reached any agreement in detail. As we aim to make this a ‘national consensus government’ we are in favour of accommodating other parties. So it will depend on the number of parties that join the Cabinet. Our only concern is that ministerial allocations should be done in a way that doesn’t weaken the prime minister in order to ensure that the head of the government can deliver.How can a government without the Maoist Centre and some other parties be called a consensus government?We have to wait for that. Leaders of political parties that fiercely criticise the government also join the Cabinet under one or other pretext. Some political parties seemingly cannot exist without being in the government.  \nOver 52% of students failed the Secondary Education Examination due to poor teacher quality, outdated teaching methods, and inadequate preparation for the new letter grading system, which requires teachers to engage students actively and assess them throughout the learning process.\nRecent ambassadorial changes and diplomatic practices are being discussed in Nepal, including the recall of ambassadors, the benefits of PM Dahal's India visit, and the progress and challenges of BRI and trade agreements with China.\nThe government has made the National ID card mandatory for government and public institution services, aiming to replace multiple cards, enhance security, and control financial fraud.\nLight to moderate rain, thunderstorms, and lightning with heavy rainfall in some areas, generally cloudy weather across the country, with maximum temperatures reaching 36.4°C in Dhangadi and minimum temperatures around 15.5°C in Jomsom.\nCloudy weather with widespread light to heavy rainfall, accompanied by thunder and lightning, is forecast across the country, particularly in Koshi, Madhesh, Gandaki, Lumbini, and Bagmati provinces.\nPartly to generally cloudy weather with light to moderate rain, thunder, and lightning is expected in various provinces, with heavy rainfall in specific areas.\nThe weather today will be generally to mostly cloudy throughout the country.Koshi, Madhesh, Bagmai, Gandaki and Lumbini provinces are expected to experience heavy to very heavy rainfall at a few places heavy rainfall has also been forecast at one or two places in Karnali and Sudurpaschim provinces.Light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is likely to occur across the country.The weather is likely to remain the same until later tonight.Heavy rainfall may continue in Koshi, Madhesh and Gandaki provinces while light rainfall is likely to occur in some places of Bagmati province.Dipayal recorded a maximum temperature of 35.7 degrees Celsius on Thursday while Jomsom had a minimum temperature of 15.5 degrees Celsius. \n\nBe elaborative as possible.
