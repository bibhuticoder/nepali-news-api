Just give me title and no other text. \n I will give you a story and the news events from today. \n    Based on news events continue the story and provide me the updated story. In the story cover all the events as much as possible, try to weave them together, making a beautiful story.\n    Be elaborative as possible. I need more text. Text only no title or headings. Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli, who reached Beijing on Monday on a four-day official visit, is set to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Li Qiang on Tuesday. Following the meetings, several project agreements and instruments are expected to be signed, officials said.Sun Weidong, vice minister for Foreign Affairs of China, Nepali Ambassador to China Krishna Prasad Oli, and Chinese Ambassador to Nepal Chen Song, among others, welcomed the Nepali delegation at Beijing Capital International Airport. Oli is leading an 87-member delegation that includes his spouse Radhika Shkaya, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba, advisors to the prime minister, members of parliament, senior government officials, and businesspersons, among others.“Prime Minister Oli will hold a meeting with Xi, the president of the People’s Republic of China tomorrow [Tuesday],” said a statement issued by the Nepali Embassy in Beijing on Monday. “On the same day, the prime minister is scheduled to hold bilateral talks with Li.”A Cabinet meeting on Sunday approved the prime minister’s visit to China, as well as projects and instruments to be signed during the visit. Besides meeting with the Chinese president and premier, Oli will hold talks with Zhao Leji, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, and will deliver a keynote address at Peking University. He will also address the Nepal-China Business Forum, jointly hosted by the Embassy of Nepal in Beijing, the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT), and the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI), on Wednesday.Sunday’s Cabinet meeting also approved the signing of a memorandum of understanding on the Volunteers’ Chinese Language Teachers’ Programme, according to Minister for Information and Communication Prithivi Subba Gurung, the government spokesman. The MoU will pave the way for Chinese teachers to teach Chinese language in various Nepali schools. Details of the programme, such as the number of Chinese teachers and working modality, will be finalised by the Ministry of Education and its Chinese counterpart, according to a foreign ministry official.China is set to provide a one-time budgetary support of $20 million to Nepal. Another agreement to accept Chinese economic and technical assistance worth 300 million RMB was also endorsed by the Cabinet on Sunday.Observers are closely watching whether the framework for cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) will be signed during this visit. A revised BRI framework document, prepared by a four-member task force from the ruling Nepali Congress and CPN-UML, has already been forwarded to the Chinese side for its consideration. Although Nepal has received positive signals on the revised BRI document, it remains uncertain whether it will be signed during Oli’s visit, a foreign ministry official told the Post before flying to Beijing on Monday.During the visit, according to government spokesperson Gurung, some project-related agreements are also expected to be signed. These include construction of an integrated check post at the Korola border point; Tokha-Chhahare tunnel road; Tokha-Chhahre-Bidur Highway; and an agreement to complete the feasibility study of 220KV Jilong/Kerung-Rasuwagadhi-Chilime cross-border power transmission line.According to Gurung, 0ther agreements include the construction of a friendship bridge in Kimathanka— Khandbari over the Arun river; construction of a multi-functional agriculture park at Chobhar; industrial park at the Korola border point; and agreement on commencing bone marrow transplant at BP Koirala Cancer Hospital. Also, a new development cooperation model for 2024–2028 between Nepal and China is also expected to be signed. During the visit, leaders and officials will engage in finalising the framework for BRI cooperation and some projects to be developed under it. The Nepali side has proposed a dozen projects to be executed under the BRI framework. Multiple officials involved in the negotiations with the Chinese told the Post that Nepal is seeking the release of pending grants announced by China since 2008 and wants to develop select projects.Similarly, an MoU will be signed between Nepal Television and China Media Group, which owns China Central Television (including China Global Television Network), China National Radio, and China Radio International.Some accords and agreements from previous visits including Araniko Highway upgrade, and the second phase of Kathmandu Ring Road expansion are likely to be signed after delegation-level talks between Oli and Li on Tuesday. Chinese assistance, including 100 electric vehicles, vans, and ambulances; and some cross-border infrastructure and connectivity-related projects, will also be discussed and signed during the prime minister’s visit, according to officials. \nAs the vote counting of the by-elections conducted to elect 41 local representatives is about to be completed, the Nepali Congress, the country’s largest party, has won the most seats. Still, the party will be far from happy. Nepali Congress candidates had, in 2022 local elections, won 29 of the 44 seats that had later gone vacant due to the deaths of the incumbents and other reasons. In the by-polls to fill these seats, the Congress is in line to win just 17 seats. The Congress won the mayor of Kirtipur Municipality, and 16 ward chairs while it had won 29 posts in earlier elections. In the recent by-elections, the Congress had already won the two posts of district coordinating committees in Kailali and Okhaldhunga unopposed as no one filed candidacy against them.Retaining the mayor of Kirtipur has come as a big relief for the party.Both the CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre), the second and third largest parties in the federal parliament, respectively, have succeeded in adding to the number of their local representatives. Of the vacant seats, each won seven in 2022. Compared to last time, while the UML added three local representatives, the Maoist Centre added two. Congress General Secretary Bishwa Prakash Sharma, who led the party’s by-poll campaign, said the results were different this time as the party contested the by-elections without any alliance. In the previous local polls, it had formed alliances with the Maoist Centre and CPN (Unified Socialist), among other fringe parties. “Although it seems that we lost some posts we had earlier won, the party members are in fact excited about the election results that we achieved with our own strength,” Sharma told the Post. The by-elections were held for one municipal mayor, two rural municipality chairpersons, four vice-chairs, one deputy mayor, and 33 ward chairs. Among these, the Congress had earlier won the post of Mayor of Kirtipur Municipality, and deputy mayor of Nalgad Municipality of Jajarkot.Likewise, it had won Gramthan Rural Municipality chairperson in Morang, Mahabu Rural Municipality chairperson in Dailekh, vice-chairperson of Gaurishankar Rural Municipality, Dolakha, and Swamikartik Khapar Rural Municipality in Bajura.Meanwhile, Maoist Centre candidates won vice-chairs in Sarkegad Rural Municipality and Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality. The Congress couldn’t retain at least 10 posts the party earlier won.The Maoists have now snatched away from the Congress Gramthan Rural Municipality in Morang and Nalgad deputy mayor in Jajarkot. Likewise, the UML has won Mahabu Rural Municipality and Swamikartik Khapar Rural Municipality.The UML has managed to retain its seven ward chairpersons but in different local units, and add a chairperson and two vice-chairpersons of rural municipalities. According to the Election Commission, UML candidate Jung Bahadur Shahi has won the post of chairman of Mahabu Rural Municipality in Dailekh.Similarly, Maoist Centre’s Namo Narayan Majhi has won the post of chairman of Gramthan Rural Municipality in Morang.Maoist Centre’s Devaka Lamichhane has been elected as deputy mayor of Nalgad Rural Municipality in Jajarkot.Likewise, Sulochana Kumari Bhandari of the UML has won the post of Vice-Chairperson of Balmiki Khapar Rural Municipality in Bajura. Her nearest rival was Pultisara Shahi of the Congress. Bhandari was earlier defeated by Maina Devi Joshi of the Nepali Congress in the 2022 local elections.The Maoist Centre did well in some places where local by-elections were held. Despite the Congress-UML alliance, the Maoist Centre won the post of vice-chair of Putha Uttarganga in Rukum (East). The Maoist Centre’s candidate Narapura Budha won the post securing 3,627 votes to defeat Kesh Kumari Tulachan of the UML who was backed by the Congress. The UML candidate Tulachan got only 2,128 votes. In the by-polls, the Nepal Majdoor Kisan Party (NMKP) candidate won the post of chairperson in ward 4 of Tilagupha Municipality in Kalikot. The party’s Khadgaraj Shahi won the post with 143 votes, defeating Naishoba Shahi of CPN (Maoist Centre), who garnered 115 votes. The post was earlier held by the Maoist Centre. Besides Bhaktapur, the party also has a presence in places like Kalikot, Humla and Dailekh. The party also has ward chairpersons in some places of Dailekh.“Our party played a big role in raising political awareness in places like Kalikot, Humla and Dailekh even during the Panchayat period,” Prem Suwal, the federal lawmaker from the party, told the Post. Among the new parties that emerged in the November 2022 elections, the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) won the post of chairperson of ward 16 of Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC).RSP’s Rojina Shrestha left the candidates of traditional parties behind. The post was earlier held by the Congress. Despite the party’s poor performance in other parts of the country where the by-polls were conducted, Shrestha’s win in KMC-16 marks the party’s debut at the local level. Shrestha secured 2,902 votes against UML’s Laxmi Ratna Tuladhar who garnered 2,220 votes. The Congress candidate Devendra Pathak managed to secure 2,214 votes in the ward.The Maoist Centre had not fielded a candidate in ward 16 of KMC. Asked why the Congress candidate lost, the party’s vice president of Kathmandu unit, Santa Kumar Maharjan, said the ward was never a Congress stronghold.“This was a ward dominated by the UML earlier as well. When all ward members were from the UML, Mukunda Risal was the only candidate to be elected from the Congress. He became the chairperson,” Maharjan said. “Risal’s victory could solely be attributed to his charismatic leadership.”Except the RSP, other new political parties failed to win any seats. The Janamat Party, which has a strong presence in Madhesh Province and currently leads the Madhesh Province government, failed to show its presence at the local level by-polls. In the by-polls held for the post of ward chairperson in seven wards in Madhesh, the Congress and the Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal led by Upendra Yadav won two posts each. The UML, the Maoist Centre and the CPN (Unified Socialist) one post each. Professor of Political Science Krishna Khanal, says that aversion to political parties played a role in this by-election. “You could say those who won in these by-elections achieved technical victories. Based on these by-polls, none of the parties can claim to have increased their internal strength,” Khanal said.  \nThough winter has already set in and the minimum temperature has dropped to seven degrees Celsius, the scourge of dengue-spreading mosquitoes continues unabated. Officials at the Ministry of Health and Population said that even though the number of infections from the deadly virus has declined, people are still contracting the disease.“Like in the previous year, we have not expected zero dengue cases in any particular month,” said Dr Gokarna Dahal, chief of the Vector Control Section at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “New cases of dengue infection are still being reported from various districts.”Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika, according to the World Health Organisation.Post-monsoon is considered a high transmission season for dengue, but Nepal has witnessed outbreaks of the deadly disease since the start of the year and in the pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons as well.Entomologists say that even if dengue spread slows naturally in the winter, the risk of infection with the deadly virus has not lessened, as the daytime maximum temperature suits virus-spreading vectors to get active.“In summer, Aedes mosquitoes bite people in the morning and evening, but in winter, they become active during the daytime when temperatures rise,” said Sishir Panta, an entomologist. “And we should not forget that even though the growth of the virus-spreading vectors slows down in winter due to cold, it does not stop.”Thirteen people have died, and over 34,000 have been infected since January 2024, according to government data. The virus has spread in all 77 districts across the country. Experts say reported dengue cases may only represent a small fraction of the true scale of the outbreak, as around 90 percent of the infected people do not show any symptoms and health authorities often underreport deaths and infections.Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms, which do not need any treatment or can be managed with paracetamol at home.As there is no specific treatment for dengue, health workers provide symptomatic care and diagnose patients based on symptoms, including platelet-rich plasma transfusion.According to experts, dengue became endemic in Nepal years ago, meaning that people get infected throughout the year.“New cases could surge once temperatures rise,” said Panta. “Also, the general public should not be complacent, as the risk has not been over. Prevention measures are essential to preventing the spread.”Experts say the disease will not stop spreading unless the lessons and experiences gained in previous outbreaks are implemented. Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects such as plastic cups and bottles could be breeding grounds for dengue-carrying mosquitoes.According to doctors, mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache and pain in the eyes are some symptoms of dengue. Doctors advise that those with these symptoms should seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and access to proper medical care can lower fatalities.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district. Since then, an increasing number of dengue infections, including major outbreaks, have been reported from many districts. The World Health Organisation (WHO) says there is no specific treatment for severe dengue, but early detection and access to proper medical care can save lives. \nNearly a year has passed, but officials say the ride-hailing service guidelines are still in the discussion phase. Government changes caused the delay.In February, the government amended the Industrial Enterprises Act 2020 recognising ride-hailing businesses as service-oriented, giving them legal status after seven years of operation in Nepal. However, 10 months later, the guidelines still remain stalled.Due to the lack of ride-hailing guidelines, a large number of service seekers are being cheated daily in terms of price and safety, and no one is listening to their grievances and complaints.“The government changed when the ride-hailing guidelines were tabled at the Cabinet for approval. Now the new government is studying and discussing the draft again,” said Balram Niraula, secretary at the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Transport, Bagmati Province.Niraula said that when the government makes changes, it requires them to start working from scratch, and the same happened with the ride-hailing guidelines.“During the previous Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government, we had tabled the draft of the guidelines in the cabinet. But the government changed and we had to start over,” he said. “Now we are updating the draft.”Another official at the Transport Ministry said the new minister needs to understand both the ride-hailing services and the guidelines that have been prepared. “It takes time.”During Tihar, many customers in the Kathmandu Valley were forced to pay exorbitantly high rates for services from InDrive and Pathao.Customers expressed anger on social media platforms and said they were charged Rs2,700 for a taxi ride from Naya Thimi of Bhaktapur to Kapan.Later, the ride-hailing companies said that the surge in fares was caused by fewer available drivers and high customer demand during the festive time.After operating unofficially for two years, the ride-hailing app inDrive was officially launched in Nepal in May. InDrive’s services are available in Kathmandu, Pokhara, and Chitwan. The company offers taxi, motorcycle, delivery, and intercity rides in Kathmandu.Frustrated with the public transport system, many people in the Kathmandu Valley rely on ride-hailing services for commuting. However, customers are not only cheated on price, their safety is also at risk due to offline rides.Ride-hailing companies said that despite a five-year old directive from the Patan High Court to regulate the sector by making laws, the government has not been able to implement any guidelines.With ride-hailing apps, riders could book, track and pay for their rides straight from their phones, and quickly navigate through clogged streets.Online app-based ride-hailing has drastically changed transportation, especially for the people in Kathmandu Valley. Ride-hailing motorbike taxi services employ thousands of people in Nepal, especially youth.Despite its growing popularity, there have been many instances of harassment. According to the government’s report, ride-hailing companies are increasing in Nepal and generating high revenues, but they are not registered and do not pay taxes.In 2017, Tootle debuted as the first ride-hailing app in Nepal. However, after two years, in January 2019, the government cracked down on ride-hailing platforms like Tootle and Pathao, but public pressure forced the government to back down, as these apps had fundamentally changed how Nepalis travelled.Subsequently, the Bagmati Province Vehicle and Transportation Management Act 2019 was implemented in February 2019 as the first legislation of Nepal to recognise the ride-sharing business through provincial law.Bagmati province declared ride-hailing services legal but issued no guidelines or policies. The Motor Vehicles and Transport Management Act 1993 states that vehicles registered for private use should not be used for public transportation.The government officially recognised ride-hailing services as a service-oriented industry in February this year under the Industrial Enterprises Act 2020. This amendment, published in the Nepal Gazette, granted ride-hailing companies legal status, affirming their place within the industrial sector. Foreign companies operate most ride-hailing apps in Nepal.The 61st annual report of the Auditor General said that despite private number plate vehicles being operated through ride-hailing platforms as public vehicles, they are not registered with the Department of Transportation Management to provide such services.The auditor general's report has highlighted issues concerning the regulation of ride-hailing services, but no action has been taken to address them so far.The draft ride-hailing guidelines propose mandatory vehicle registration. Ride-hailing drivers must register their cars and motorbikes in a manner similar to traditional taxis and operate under the regulation of the Ministry of Transport.Companies would also be required to renew their operations annually at transport management offices. The guidelines aim to regulate fares and propose mandatory insurance for passengers. \nOpener Anil Sah scored a stellar unbeaten half-century as Janakpur Bolts defeated Karnali Yaks by eight wickets to continue their winning start in the Nepal Premier League T20 cricket tournament at the TU Cricket Ground in Kirtipur on Monday.Sah powered Janakpur, who were chasing a target of 142, with a scintillating 62 off 42 balls, laced with six boundaries and three sixes, sealing the win in just 15.1 overs.A second victory in as many matches puts Janakpur, who had opened the tournament with a dominant eight-wicket victory over Biratnagar Kings on Saturday, on the summit of the eight-team standings with four points.The top four teams at the end of the single round-robin league progress into the playoffs, where the league winners and runners-up clash in the Qualifier 1 for a direct final berth, while the third and fourth placed teams battle in the Eliminator. The losing side of the Qualifier 1 vie against the winners of Eliminator in the Qualifier 2 for the second spot in the title match.Sah’s brilliance was complemented by fellow opener Aasif Sheikh, who added a brisk 36 off 29 balls.The pair, also Nepal’s national team openers, shared an 84-run stand that laid the foundation for a successful chase.Sheikh fell to Mousom Dhakal in the 9.4 overs, but the American Lahiru Milantha and New Zealand all-rounder James Neesham ensured a smooth finish.Milantha, who had scored an unbeaten half-century against Biratnagar, added 24 in his aggressive 13 ball-knock to guide Janakpur closer to target. He was trapped leg before by Zeeshan Maqsood in the 12.5 overs.Neesham, playing his first match after missing the opener, then contributed 16 not out off eight balls to take Janakpur to 142-2.Earlier, Karnali opted to bat first after winning the toss and posted 141-7 from their 20 overs.Tournament’s biggest name, former Indian star Shikhar Dhawan, failed to live up the billings as he faltered with a modest 14 off 14, bowled by Harsh Thaker.A string of early dismissals, including opener Dev Khanal (1), West Indies batter Chadwick Walton (8), and Oman’s Zeeshan Maqsood (0), left Karnali in deep trouble at 35-4 in 7.4 overs.Babar Hayat dragged Karnali to 68-5 in the 14th overs.But local hero Gulsan Jha led the recovery with 36 off 27 before Arjun Gharti and Sompal Kami added 56 runs for the seventh wicket to set a competitive target.Gharti scored 33 off 22 balls, while Kami played 29 not out off 13 balls.Chitwan Rhinos off to winning startChitwan Rhinos opened their campaign with a five-wicket victory over Kathmandu Gurkhas earlier at the same venue.Pakistani bowler Sohail Tanvir, a late replacement for the injured Marchant de Lange, was the destroyer-in-chief as his 5-21 restricted Kathmandu to 111-9.The pacer struck with his first delivery to get rid of Englishman Stephen Eskinazi for just two in the second over. Tanvir then dismantled the middle order with two more wickets in his next two overs, first cutting short the aggressive start of Netherlands opener Michael Lievitt (25 off 16) and then Bhim Sharki (1), that left Kathmandu reeling at 39-4 at the end of the power play.Sumit Maharjan added 29 off 41 and Shankar Rana played 17-ball 16 to start a brief resistance and Dan Douthwaite played 19 not out as Kathmandu limped past 100.But their total fell well below par as Tanvir returned at the death and took the wickets of Karan KC and Shahab Alam.Chitwan’s chase was also full of hurdles; they were reduced to 68-5 in 8.5 overs, with Shabhab Alam striking thrice.They lost openers Deepak Bohara (7) and Afghanistan opener Hassan Eisakhil (12) to Alam.England’s Luc Benkenstein contributed 22 off 17 before Gerhard Erasmus trapped him lbw.Kushal Malla then fell to Douthwaite for 11 before Alam dispatched Ravi Bopara.But a composed 28 not out off 31 from Santosh Karki, accompanied by Sharad Vesawkar’s 11 off 21, guided Chitwan to 114-5 in 17.1 overs. \nPolice apprehended four Indian nationals for allegedly running an illegal betting operation during the ongoing Nepal Premier League (NPL). The arrests were carried out at the Tribhuvan International Cricket Ground in Kirtipur, where the tournament has been taking place since last Saturday.The Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) identified the accused as Suman Ghosh from Kolkata, Amit Yadav from Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, and Sumanth Kumar and Brajesh Kumar from Saharsa, Bihar. They were reportedly using online betting platforms such as Sports Baji and Probo to organise gambling directly from the cricket ground.The police seized six mobile phones and four Indian Aadhaar cards from the suspects. SP Hobindra Bogati, CIB’s spokesperson, confirmed that further investigations are underway to enforce Nepal’s laws against betting. \nChitwan Rhinos secured a dominant 87-run victory over Pokhara Avengers in the second match of the ongoing Nepal Premier League at the Tribhuvan University Cricket Ground, Kirtipur, on Tuesday.Put to bat first, Chitwan set a challenging target of 162 runs, which Pokhara failed to chase, being bowled out for a mere 74 in 13.2 overs—the lowest total in this year’s tournament so far.Pokhara’s innings got off to a disastrous start, losing six wickets for just seven runs within four overs. Sohail Tanveer struck in the first over, claiming three wickets, including Pokhara captain Kushal Bhurtel for a golden duck. Rijan Dhakal followed up with another hat-trick in the fourth over, leaving the Avengers reeling.Narayan Joshi top-scored for Pokhara with a gritty 30 off 24 balls, including three fours and two sixes.For Chitwan, Tanveer, Dhakal, and Luc Benkenstein each claimed three wickets, while Deepak Bohora picked up one.Earlier, Chitwan’s batting effort was anchored by Ravi Bopara’s 51 off 38 balls, supported by captain Kushal Malla, who smashed 38 off 23 balls with four sixes. The pair’s 68-run partnership for the fourth wicket proved pivotal after Chitwan found themselves at 46-3 in the powerplay.Raymon Reifer and Bas de Leede picked up two wickets each for Pokhara, with Sagar Dhakal adding one to his tally.The win places Chitwan in a strong position in the league, following their earlier victory over Kathmandu Gurkhas by five wickets. Pokhara will look to recover quickly from this embarrassing defeat as the tournament progresses. \nUS Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs Donald Lu is arriving in Nepal.The United States Department of State in a media note said Lu will travel to India, Sri Lanka, and Nepal from December 3 to December 10. His trip will strengthen cooperation with key partners in South Asia to promote regional prosperity and security, reads the note.Assistant Secretary Lu will conclude his trip in Kathmandu, Nepal, meeting with senior leaders to advance cooperation on environmental protection, women’s empowerment, and sustainable development.He will meet with youth leaders to gain insights into their vision for the future of US-Nepal relations. Additionally, discussions will emphasise the importance of cultural preservation, recognising Nepal’s rich heritage as a cornerstone of its identity and a key driver of its tourism and economy, according to the note.In New Delhi, India, Assistant Secretary Lu will support US-India collaboration in the Indo-Pacific and beyond. He will join Assistant Secretary of State for the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs Daniel Kritenbrink to lead US participation in the US-India East Asia Consultations.

Lokesh Bam (2) and Nicholas Kirton (5) followed cheaply, leaving the team reeling at 11-3. Rajesh Pulami (15) and Basir Ahamad (24) offered some resistance, but regular wickets kept the Kings under pressure. Abinash Bohara’s impressive spell (3-17) and Scott Kuggeleijn’s triple strike (3-30) dismantled the middle and lower order. Earlier, despite early setbacks, the Royals set a challenging target, largely due to Captain Dipendra Singh Airee’s brilliant knock of 57 not out from just 24 balls, which included three fours and five sixes.The innings began on a shaky note, with the Royals losing Amit Shrestha (1) early, caught by Martin Guptill off Ismat Alam in the second over. Binod Bhandari (23) and Brandon McMullen (36) steadied the ship, but both fell to Anil Kharel, with Bhandari caught by Pratis GC and Brandon McMullen dismissed similarly. Aarif Sheikh (9) and Saif Zaib (14) also departed quickly, as the Royals struggled at 69-4 by the 11th over.However, Airee’s aggressive stroke play turned the game in favour of the Royals. His rapid-fire innings included a flurry of boundaries and sixes, providing the necessary acceleration in the latter stages. Ishan Pandey (21) also contributed to the cause before being run out.Scott Kuggeleijn (10) and Basant Khatri (4) added brief cameos, but it was Airee who took charge, guiding the Royals to a competitive total. The Royals finished their innings at 182-7. \nNepal and China signed a total of nine deals, including memorandums of understanding and agreements, on Tuesday during Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli's official visit.According to the foreign ministry spokesperson Krishna Prasad Dhakal, the agreements and MoUs include letter of exchange on the construction of the Tokha-Chhahare tunnel, MoU on Nepal-China trade enhancement, exchange of certificate on the completion of the nine-storey Basantapur Durbar reconstruction, protocol on export of thermally processed buffalo meat, and MoU on development plan (2025-2029) between the Finance Ministry and the China International Development Cooperation Agency of China.Likewise, a memorandum of understanding on economic and technical assistance, exchange of letters on cash assistance of RMB300 million, MoU on volunteer Chinese language teachers and another MoU between Nepal Television and China Media Group (CMG) on communication technology.Prime Minister Oli was received by Chinese Premier Li Qiang at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing earlier on Tuesday.Prime Minister Oli was accorded with a guard of honour by the Chinese People’s Liberation Army. The ceremony, attended by prominent Chinese leaders, also included formal introduction of the respective delegations by the two leaders.Later today, Oli is scheduled to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping. Oli leads an 87-member delegation, which includes his spouse Radhika Shakya, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba, senior advisors, members of parliament, high-ranking government officials, and business leaders. A Cabinet meeting held on Sunday approved the visit and endorsed the projects and agreements to be signed. During his stay, Oli will meet Zhao Leji, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, and deliver a keynote speech at Peking University. He will also address the Nepal-China Business Forum on Wednesday, which is being jointly hosted by the Embassy of Nepal in Beijing, the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT), and the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI).Following the bilateral meeting between Prime Minister Oli and Chinese Premier Li Qiang today, the two countries signed the following bilateral agreements and MoUs:1. Exchange of Letter on Tokha Chahare Tunnel Road2. MOU on Nepal-China trade enhancement 3. Exchange of Certificate on the completion of the Nine-storey Basantapur Durbar reconstruction 4. Protocol on export of thermally processed buffalo meat5. MOU on development plan6. MOU on financial and technical assistance 7. Exchange of Letter on cash assistance8. MOU on Volunteer Chinese language teachers9. MOU on communication technologies between Nepal Television and China Media Group \nThe Nepal Premier League, which kicked off on Saturday, has taken the country by storm. Never before had a national-level tournament created such buzz among domestic and international audiences. Nepali cricket fanbase, who grew up watching the Indian Premier League, are now ecstatic to have their own truly international franchise league comprising no less than eight teams. The fact that people from different parts of the country are travelling to the Tribhuvan University Cricket Ground to cheer on their favourite teams speaks volumes about the tournament’s mass appeal.The ‘Festival of Himalayas’ features big cricketing names like former Indian opener Shikhar Dhawan, New Zealand all-rounder James Neesham, Dutch Michael Levitt, Namibia’s Gerhard Erasmus, and Australia’s Ben Cutting. Nepali cricketers—both national players and newcomers—will now get to rub shoulders with these global cricket superstars, which will greatly boost their confidence. The NPL will also hopefully offer these players enough financial incentives to pursue cricket as a profession. In fact, the recent all-format international success of the Indian national team is often attributed to the IPL, for some of the same reasons. The start of the NPL this year could thus mark a sea-change in Nepal’s success in international cricket. The league will have a global audience after getting the Star Sports Network, an internationally established TV network, as the official broadcaster; and after partnering with the Twenty-first Century Media Sports, a company that has managed many international events. They will help showcase Nepal as a global cricket destination. No wonder Nepali cricket fans are upbeat. As one fan placard during Saturday’s opening match between Janakpur Bolts and Biratnagar Kings put it: “No matter who wins it is the victory of Nepali cricket.”Done well, the NPL’s success will resonate much beyond the international sports scene. The vast majority of Nepali youths are looking to leave the country the first opportunity they get. They see no hope in their country. But when they see that cricketers and commentators and organisers from around the world are coming to their homeland to play as professionals, perhaps this feeling of disenchantment with their native country will go down a bit. Additionally, if Nepal can successfully pull off an international tournament like the NPL, there is no reason this welcoming country cannot host tournaments like the cricket Asia Cup. But there will also be challenges. The Cricket Association of Nepal has taken up the monumental task of organising an eight-team tournament. The association’s history of managing similar tournaments is checkered. For instance, the CAN-organised Nepal T20 League in 2022-23 was marred by controversies even before it kicked off due to allegations about match-fixing. The body has also faced criticisms for negligence, delayed payments and incompetence. Even in the opening match of the NPL on Saturday, the association failed to manage the crowd, which in turn led to injuries. The next day, fans were seen running on to the cricket pitch at the completion of a match. In order to maintain the integrity of Nepali cricket, it is vital to minimise such incidents. Hopefully, the CAN is learning with every match. The CAN must get the NPL right, for the tournament’s benefits are potentially limitless. The millions of international TV viewers of the NPL will get to see what a beautiful country Nepal is and this in turn could boost the country’s tourism prospects. The NPL itself, linked to a multitude of stakeholders, can create many profitable jobs, especially as other stadiums are built and the tournament expands to other parts of Nepal. Exciting times, indeed.  \nThe November 27 review meeting of the government’s performance in the first quarter of the current fiscal year (2024-25) was reportedly a big disappointment to the ministers and secretaries. Prime Minister KP Sharam Oli lambasted the dismal performance of key ministries and was irked by the worrisome economic indicators.Nepali economy reels under unpalatable paradoxical indicators. On the upside, the current account surplus is Rs112 billion, whereas the balance of payment is also in surplus of Rs185 billion. Further, the remittance inflow is impressive, with more than 10 percent growth. The foreign currency reserve is the highest in Nepal's history, touching $16.6 billion. The loanable liquidity available in the banking system has crossed Rs700 billion. Similarly, the non-performing assets in banks and financial institutions have gone up to 4.5 percent of disbursement. In its first quarterly review published last week, the Nepal Rastra Bank has chosen not to change its main monetary policy stance.During the first four months of the current fiscal year, till mid-November, merchandise exports were only Rs46 billion against the import of Rs513.4 billion. Capital expenditure remains pathetic at less than 11 percent of the capital allocation of Rs357 billion while it should have crossed at least 35 percent on average. Similarly, revenue collection is short of its quarterly target by about 15 percent. However, public debt is expanding exponentially, crossing 45 percent of the national gross domestic product (GDP) at Rs5.7 trillion. Development partners have not released any grants so far during the last four months of the fiscal year, and public financial management has thus become increasingly challenging.An agonising question here is: Despite some strong fiscal and monetary fundamentals as indicated above, why has the economic administration of the state failed to utilise them and waded through a widespread loss of confidence among investors, consumers and players in the market? Apparently, the reason for economic underperformance and pessimism is not only the inadequacy of financial resources but also the lack of failure in the overall economic management of the government on both fiscal and non-fiscal fronts. Economic managementEconomic management covers the quality of three closely related policy areas: Fiscal and monetary policies and sovereign debt. It is almost everything about an economy’s operation and governance.Despite shrinking revenue and alarmingly ebbing financial assistance from its development partners, managing a smooth stream of financial resources has been the greatest challenge to Nepal's fiscal policy or budget balance. Over the decades, subsequent governments have failed to consolidate their tax base and tax net, and undermined the importance of exploring new sources of capital to flow into the economy. Overdependence on import-based revenue is antithetical to the very idea of making the economy self-sustainable. The cause of concern is that the sovereign has barely demonstrated the management skills required to bridge the development financing gap, which is becoming herculean with time.Nepal Government’s official review report states that “to achieve the targets of the 2030 Agenda (Sustainable Development Goals and Paris Agreement 2030), a total investment of $163 billion is required for 2024-30, i.e. more than $23 billion per year”. This is an impossible task given that Nepal's total national budget in actual is barely $10 billion. Unless the government demonstrates its creative resource management ability, our dream of development and prosperity will not even be partially realised.The second glaring challenge is the lack of capacity for resource absorption at the government’s executing units, from federal ministries to ward offices in municipalities. Not only has the capital budget allocation come to 18 percent of the total budget outlay, but only about 60 percent of it is spent. This is purely a question of management efficiency at all levels: Project prioritisation, project implementation and project management at the ground level.Third, the biggest hurdle for the provincial and local levels is the lack of skilled human resources with economic understanding and management skills. Finding and maintaining human resources with thematic and sectoral competence, even at the provincial level, for planning, prioritisation, public procurement, plan implementation, expenditure effectiveness and expenditure monitoring is proving daunting. The situation is far more dire at the municipality level. Due to the lack of efficient economic management in all three tiers of the government, the necessity to review formulas of equalisation, grant allocation, revenue and other financial resource sharing does not seem to be the priority of the dispensation. After almost a decade of fiscal federalism, it is now imperative to have an evidence-based approach to review the institutional and operational efficacy of the gamut of public financial management under the federal polity.Emerging challengesEvidently, Nepal's conventional economic management paradigm faces challenges stemming from the vicious cycle of low resource availability and efficiency and low level of economic output (growth). A peek into the future brings about a new set of challenges to the fore. Among dozens of issues, three problems warrant immediate policy attention.One, Nepal's political and bureaucratic decision-making process has summarily failed to take the state’s federal architecture into due cognisance. Such evasion, omission and ad-hocism are more pronounced in economic and financial matters.Two, a critical departure is inevitable to manage the trade-off between Nepal's acute infrastructural social development needs and the obligation to make all these sustainable and environment-friendly. The unequivocal necessity to reduce the risk of climate change-induced disasters and prepare for post-disaster rescue, relief and rehabilitation compels us to source additional financial resources and their effective mobilisation.Finally, like any other developing country, Nepal's prospects of catching up to become a digitally advanced and knowledge-centric nation are contingent on its ability to invest in these capital-intensive endeavours. To bridge the growing digital divide across regions, ethnicities, economic classes and genders, effective economic management would entail not only finding the financial means but also involving a substantial social capital for judicious outcomes from every drop of the nation's investment. \nOnce, human rights were understood as the simple principle that one person’s rights should never extend beyond the tip of another’s nose unless invited. On December 10 each year, the world comes together to observe International Human Rights Day, a day that underscores the inherent dignity and the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family. First recognised in 1950 under the guidance of the United Nations, this day has evolved into a global call to action for the protection and promotion of human rights worldwide. Yet, despite decades of progress, violations persist across the globe, reminding us that the fight for human rights is far from over. The debate on human rights dates back centuries, and two of the most prominent figures in this discourse Edmund Burke and Thomas Paine left a lasting legacy that continues to resonate today.Burke, a supporter of the monarchy, saw the preservation of tradition and hierarchy as essential to societal stability, while Paine, a revolutionary thinker, championed liberty, equality, and the rights of individuals. One of Paine’s most famous lines, “We pity the plumage, but forget the dying bird,” directly addressed the hypocrisy of focusing on superficial issues while ignoring the deeper, more urgent concerns. In modern times, these words still carry weight, highlighting how we often address surface-level concerns while systemic injustices persist, unnoticed or unchallenged. The observance of Human Rights Day invites us to reflect on the progress made and the work still to be done. It is a reminder that the principles outlined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 10 December 1948, remain crucial in shaping a more just and equitable world.However, despite the ground-breaking achievements of the UDHR, widespread violations continue, and the fight for human dignity remains on-going. Throughout history, the struggle for human rights has been a journey fraught with obstacles. One notable turning point in this struggle occurred in the United States during the 19th century. The abolition of slavery, a monumental achievement, came about through the tireless efforts of leaders like Abraham Lincoln, who, in 1863, led the nation to abolish the institution through the 13th Amendment to the Constitution. This was a transformative moment in the history of human rights. Despite the victory, however, African-Americans continued to face systemic discrimination and segregation for many years after.The 1954 landmark decision in Brown v. Board of Education, where the US Supreme Court declared racial segregation in public schools unconstitutional, was another significant victory for human rights in America. But even after this, African-Americans had to fight for basic rights like access to education, the vote, and an end to discriminatory laws. It was only in 1965, after decades of struggle and advocacy by civil rights leaders like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., that African-Americans were granted the right to vote under the Voting Rights Act. These achievements were monumental, but they were hard-won, demonstrating the lengths to which marginalised communities had to go in order to claim their human rights. Internationally, the story of human rights has also been one of continuous struggle and progress.The United Nations’ adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 was a defining moment. It set out, for the first time, a global standard for human rights, affirming the rights of individuals to life, liberty, and security, among other freedoms. The UDHR became the foundation upon which many countries would base their own human rights frameworks. But the road to realising these rights in full has not been easy. Over the decades, the UDHR has been supplemented by two essential covenants—the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights—passed in 1966 to reinforce and clarify the rights outlined in the UDHR.One of the key figures behind the development of the UDHR was Eleanor Roosevelt, who, as the chairperson of the UN Human Rights Commission, played a pivotal role in its creation. Known as the “mother of modern human rights,” Roosevelt’s vision for a world where all people were treated equally and with dignity shaped the discourse on human rights for generations. Unfortunately, she did not live to see the full impact of the UDHR, passing away in 1962, but her legacy lives on. Since 1998, the Eleanor Roosevelt Award for Human Rights has been awarded annually to individuals who have made significant contributions to the protection of human rights. As we reflect on the history of human rights, we must also acknowledge the many challenges that remain today.In the United States, for example, despite significant progress, debates about gun control and mass shootings continue to spark deep divisions. The United Nations and various human rights organisations have called for greater restrictions on firearms, but powerful interest groups like the National Rifle Association (NRA) continue to push back against any form of regulation. The on-going violence in schools and public places is a stark reminder that the struggle for human rights continues, and that the protection of human life and safety is an essential component of human rights. In India, human rights protections are enshrined in the Constitution, which guarantees the right to life, liberty, and equality. However, even in a country with such a strong legal framework, violations of human rights are not uncommon.Discrimination based on caste, religion, gender, and disability continues to affect millions of people across the country. While the Constitution guarantees equal rights for all, the reality often falls short. The National Human Rights Commission, which works to address these issues, plays an important role, but there is still much work to be done. The issue of discrimination remains one of the most pervasive challenges to human rights. Genderbased violence, including domestic abuse, sexual assault, and trafficking, continues to devastate the lives of women and girls around the world. In many countries, LGBTQ+ individuals face violence, discrimination, and the denial of basic rights.Refugees and migrants, fleeing war, persecution, and poverty, are often subjected to inhumane conditions and denied their rights to safety and protection. The most vulnerable members of society, including those who are stateless, face some of the most extreme forms of discrimination, and the international community must do more to protect them. On a global scale, poverty and inequality are also significant barriers to realising human rights. Despite progress in some areas, the gap between the rich and the poor continues to widen. Economic inequalities, along with the challenges posed by climate change, pose major threats to the realisation of human rights for millions of people around the world. The struggle for human rights is far from over.While progress has been made, there are still millions of people around the world who are denied their basic rights and dignity. The world must come together to address the root causes of discrimination, inequality, and violence. Human rights are not just abstract concepts; they are the foundation of a just and peaceful world. As we observe International Human Rights Day later this month, we must renew our commitment to these principles and work to ensure that they are upheld for all people, everywhere.The fight for human rights is not just the responsibility of governments or international organisations. It is a responsibility shared by all of us, whether through advocacy, education, or simply standing up for justice. We must remember the words of Eleanor Roosevelt, “Where, after all, do universal human rights begin? In small places, close to home.” It is in our homes, our communities, and our everyday actions that the future of human rights will be determined.—The Statesman (India)/ANN \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli heads to China today amid a heated debate on the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). At the centre of the debate is an argument over whether Nepal should accept only grants to develop bilateral Nepal-China projects or such projects can also be built with loans. In the end, the two main ruling parties—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—decided that there would be no loan deals during Oli’s China trip. The Congress had been adamant that Nepal cannot afford any more loans and as such there was no question of adding a financial burden to the country. As things stand, 12 projects are lined up for signing. An agreement on the ‘BRI framework for cooperation’ is also likely, which, at least in theory, should add momentum to old and new bilateral projects. There are multiple readings of the two ruling parties’ disagreements on negotiating with the Chinese. In one, the Congress, as the biggest ruling party, played a dubious role by unnecessarily tying the prime minister’s hands before an important visit.Oli, in this reading, won’t have much to show at the end of the trip. Yet there can be an alternate and more charitable reading of the recent sequence of events—and one which will be more salubrious to the country’s interests. The BRI became so controversial on the eve of Oli’s China trip precisely because there was lack of clarity on what being a part of it entailed for Nepal. When the country signed up to the initiative’s framework agreement back in 2017, there was little debate even as grey areas galore. For instance, the document Nepal signed seven years ago is yet to be made public, fanning many speculations. In this context, the new debate on the kind of cooperation the country can expect under the BRI was much needed. Unlike in the past when they were querulous opponents, this time, as coalition partners, the Congress and the UML were forced to come to an understanding on the initiative. They did this through a four-member taskforce that carefully dissected the new China-proposed framework. The Nepali side has tweaked the new BRI framework document in line with the suggestions of the taskforce and sent it back to China for final approval. Nepal has long felt the need for a broad political understanding on vital foreign policy issues. Yet such an understanding has invariably been made a victim to top leaders’ never-ending jockeying for power. This time, the differences between the Congress and the UML over the BRI, and the wider debate it sparked, have helped the country arrive at a more nuanced position on how to engage with China, one of Nepal’s two most important foreign friends. The deals Prime Minister Oli locks up in Beijing matter. But, more importantly, the decision of the country’s two biggest political forces to devise a common platform on a vital foreign policy issue bodes well for Nepal. If and when Oli goes to India, perhaps the two parties can come up with a similar common position. And the same while dealing with other important foreign actors. The sum of these understandings can in turn form a solid basis for a more consensus based Nepali foreign policy. Perhaps this extrapolation is a little simplistic. But the goal of greater consensus looks more achievable today than it did even a week ago.  \nQatar’s ambassador to Nepal Mishal bin Mohammed Ali Al Ansari paid a courtesy call to Vice President Ram Sahaya Prasad Yadav at the Vice President’s office in Lainchaur on Tuesday. The meeting was focused on bilateral relations, employment, trade, and the exchange of visits, according to the Vice President's Office.During the discussion, Vice President Yadav requested the Qatari government to ensure round-the-clock insurance for Nepali workers, facilitate the rescue and compensation of Nepalis who have died or been injured in Qatar, and provide necessary assistance to Nepalis in hospitals, deportation centres, and prisons.“There are currently 67 Nepalis serving prison sentences in Qatar, and many others are living undocumented,” said Vice President Yadav. “Iurge Qatar government to take initiations to grant amnesty, reduce prison terms, and assist undocumented Nepalis in obtaining regular employment or returning to Nepal.”The Vice President expressed satisfaction with the collaboration between Nepal and Qatar in regional and multilateral forums on issues of mutual interest. He also appreciated Qatar’s mediation efforts in securing the release of Nepali citizen Bipin Joshi and other hostages.Ambassador Ansari emphasised the importance of strengthening Nepal-Qatar relations and expressed Qatar’s commitment to promoting and protecting investments in Nepal. “There are currently 400,000 Nepali workers in Qatar, and we are working to bring domestic workers from Nepal as well,” he said. \nUkraine on Tuesday blasted an agreement struck 30 years ago under which it relinquished nuclear weapons in exchange for security assurances that never materialised, as it makes a concerted push for an invitation to join the NATO alliance.Kyiv is desperately calling for robust security guarantees to protect it from renewed Russian aggression as US President-elect Donald Trump’s return to the White House raises fears of a rapidly-struck settlement to the war that would leave it exposed.Ukraine’s foreign ministry pointed to the 1994 Budapest Memorandum which saw Kyiv give up the world’s third-largest nuclear arsenal in return for security assurances, including from Russia, after the 1991 Soviet breakup.“Today, the Budapest Memorandum is a monument to short-sightedness in strategic security decision-making,” the ministry wrote in a statement, marking this week’s anniversary of the December 5, 1994, agreement.It said the agreement “should serve as a reminder to the current leaders of the Euro-Atlantic community that building a European security architecture at the expense of Ukraine’s interests, rather than taking them into consideration is destined to failure.”Ukraine has denounced the memorandum since 2014, long before the 2022 invasion, when Russian troops seized and annexed Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula before backing paramilitary proxies in the east.That’s enough to supply around a dozen enterprises, the company said.The fighting in Ukraine’s east, which killed thousands, was brought to an uneasy ceasefire followed by dozens of rounds of talks under what was known as the Minsk agreements.Even after almost three years of all-out war, Kyiv has balked at the prospect of a return to similar negotiations that could see a temporary ceasefire but leave open the prospect of a new Russian invasion.“Enough of the Budapest Memorandum. Enough of the Minsk Agreements. Twice is enough, we cannot fall into the same trap a third time. We simply have no right to do so,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said.Kyiv wants NATO members to issue an invitation at a meeting of the alliance’s foreign ministers that starts on Tuesday, as the invasion grinds toward its three-year mark and Russia makes battlefield gains.The foreign ministry statement called on the United States and Britain, also signatories to the 1994 memorandum, as well as France and China, which it said also acceded to it, to support the provision of security guarantees to Ukraine.“We are convinced that the only real guarantee of security for Ukraine, as well as a deterrent to further Russian aggression against Ukraine and other states, is Ukraine’s full membership in NATO,\" it said.Russia sees the idea of Ukraine’s integration into NATO as anathema and says it is an unacceptable security threat. \nChina will ban exports to the US of items related to gallium, germanium, antimony and superhard materials that have potential military applications, its commerce ministry said on Tuesday, a day after Washington’s latest crackdown on China’s chip sector.Beijing’s directive on so-called dual-use items, which cites safeguarding national security and interests and takes immediate effect, also requires stricter review of end-usage for graphite items shipped to the United States.“In principle, the export of gallium, germanium, antimony, and superhard materials to the United States shall not be permitted,” the ministry said.The curbs strengthen enforcement of existing limits on exports of the critical minerals that Beijing began rolling out last year but apply only to the US in the latest escalation of trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies ahead of President-elect Donald Trump taking office.However, there have been no Chinese shipments of wrought and unwrought germanium or gallium to the US this year through October, even though it was the fourth and fifth-largest market for the minerals, respectively, a year earlier, Chinese customs data show.Gallium and germanium are used in semiconductors, while germanium is also used in infrared technology, fibre optic cables and solar cells.Similarly, China’s overall October shipments of antimony products plunged by 97% from September after Beijing’s move to limit its exports took effect. China accounted last year for 48% of globally mined antimony, which is used in ammunition, infrared missiles, nuclear weapons and night vision goggles, as well as in batteries and photovoltaic equipment.China’s announcement comes after the United States launched its third crackdown in three years on China’s semiconductor industry on Monday, curbing exports to 140 companies, including chip equipment maker Naura Technology Group. \nIndian foreign ministry says action taken to step up security for all Bangladesh missions across IndiaIndia today said the security breach of the premises at the Bangladesh Assistant High Commission in Agartala, the capital city of the northeastern state of Agartala is “deeply regrettable”.The Indian Ministry of External Affairs, in a statement, also said it is taking steps to step up security in diplomatic missions of Bangladesh across the country.“Diplomatic and consular properties should not be targeted under any circumstances,” the MEA said in a statement amidst rising tensions in bilateral ties.The comments by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) came hours after thousands of people took out a massive rally around the Bangladeshi mission in Tripura protesting the arrest of Hindu monk Chinmoy Krishna Das and alleged attacks on minorities in Bangladesh.According to PTI, over 50 protesters reportedly entered the premises of the Bangladesh mission in Agartala, triggering concerns among those present at the complex.The rally was taken out under the banner of Hindu Sangharsh Samity, an affiliate of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP).A memorandum was submitted to the Assistant High Commissioner of Bangladesh in Agartala, Arif Mohammad, over the issue, PTI said.“The incident earlier today of the breach of premises at the Bangladesh Assistant High Commission in Agartala is deeply regrettable,” the MEA said in a statement.It said the Indian government is taking action to step up security for the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi and other missions of the country in India.“The government is taking action to step up security arrangements for the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi and their deputy/assistant high commissions in the country,” it said.Last Friday, MEA spokesman Randhir Jaiswal said that the interim government in Bangladesh must live up to its responsibility of protecting all minorities as it expressed serious concern over the “surge” of extremist rhetoric and increasing incidents of violence against Hindus.Relations between India and Bangladesh have come under strain after the interim government headed by Professor Muhammad Yunus came to power following the ouster of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on August 5.-In Association with ANN \nCocoa farmer Joseph Arkoh’s vote in Saturday’s election in Ghana hinges on one unlikely issue: fertiliser.“All of us farmers are suffering,” the 56-year-old said, as labourers harvested bright yellow pods on his land deep in the bush. “When we meet, the fertiliser and chemicals are big concerns.”Following the pandemic, a painful cost-of-living crisis and a sovereign debt default, Ghana’s economy is again growing. But the cocoa sector in the world’s number 2 producer is in the throes of a crisis.In an expected close contest between the ruling New Patriotic Party’s (NPP) Mahamudu Bawumia, the current vice-president, and former president John Dramani Mahama of the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC) party, the votes of cocoa farmers could be decisive. And many of them are angry.“The NPP, they’re not for farmers. They’re for business,” said one farmer in a ruling party stronghold, who asked not to be named. “I am voting NDC.”Previously, he supported NPP.Cocoa farming households, estimated to constitute around 2 million voters, are a heavily courted voter bloc in a country with a total electorate of more than 18 million.As the cocoa sector’s problems help to alienate farmers from the government, at least one voter survey has tipped Mahama to win, although detailed polling data is not available in Ghana.“Should the trend in favour of the NPP be reversed due to any disaffection over cocoa, this will reinforce a pattern analysts are observing in the upcoming elections: the NPP losing most of the swing vote,” said Bright Simons, of the Accra-based IMANI thinktank.‘JUST BEGGING’ FOR PRICE RISESOn the campaign trail, both leading candidates are after the cocoa vote.“We have helped cocoa farmers. Cocoa farming has become good. We’ve raised cocoa price,” Bawumia told growers during a campaign stop last week.His campaign declined a Reuters request for an interview.Ghana’s cocoa production peaked in 2021, with output of over 1 million metric tons of beans. But it has been in rapid decline ever since, hitting its lowest level in decades last season.Analysts say climate change and tree disease are responsible, while many farmers also blame the government for failing to clamp down on wildcat gold mining that has destroyed large parts of the cocoa heartland.The government-set price for farmers has increased under NPP, but Ghana’s cedi currency is depreciating as global markets for the chocolate ingredient are at historic highs.That has left farmer incomes lagging global price trends and fuelled smuggling.“The government should be sympathetic,” said 34-year-old farmer Abubakar Jebril. “We are just begging that they raise the price.”MONEY FOR MANAGEMENT, CUTS FOR FARMERSMuch of the farmers’ ire is reserved for Cocobod, the state regulator that manages the cocoa sector.Cocobod did not immediately respond to a Reuters’ request for comment.Even as production has shrunk, Cocobod’s spending has ballooned. Its accounts showed administrative costs more than tripled between 2018 and 2023, sparking accusations of waste and corruption.A 2023 government audit of a programme to rehabilitate roads used to transport cocoa to warehouses and ports found that just 13% of contracts were awarded through competitive bidding.Cocobod awarded contracts worth 18.2 billion cedis ($1.2 billion), or more than six times the programme’s budget.At the same time, it rolled back free fertiliser distributions for farmers.“They’re pushing all the money to themselves on cars and other things and reduced spending on the farmers,” Mahama said last week while campaigning in Takoradi, an important cocoa-growing region.Mahama has promised to distribute free fertiliser, improve Cocobod’s management, cut administrative costs, and combat illegal mining and smuggling.Bawumia has been less specific but Cocobod, at the International Monetary Fund’s behest, has proposed a turnaround plan to reduce costs and increase farmers’ share of cocoa revenues.Industry players remain sceptical about either candidate's pledges to reverse the sector’s decline.On his farm, Arokoh, who voted for the ruling party in the last election, still hopes that Bawumia and the NPP will address his main concern. But so far he has been disappointed.“If they give me fertiliser, I will vote for them,” he said. “If not, then I will change and vote for NDC.” \nChief of Army Staff (CoAS) General Ashok Raj Sigdel will leave for a four-day visit to India on December 11 at the invitation of Indian Army Chief General Upendra Dwivedi. During the visit, General Sigdel will be conferred with the honorary rank of General of the Indian Army, a longstanding tradition between the two countries. Sources from the Ministry of Defence confirmed the trip to the Post. Earlier, on November 20, General Dwivedi visited Nepal for five days, during which President Ramchandra Paudel conferred him with the honorary rank of General of the Nepal Army in a ceremony at the President’s Office. General Dwivedi visited key locations during his stay and met President Paudel, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, and CoAS Sigdel. The Indian Army remains a major military donor to Nepal. \nA recent UNESCO report revealed that two-thirds of social media content creators do not verify whether the information they post is accurate.Furthermore, 73 percent of surveyed creators expressed a desire for training on fact-checking.The report, “Behind the Screens: Insight From Content Creators”, published on November 26, surveyed 500 online content creators from 45 countries and territories through an online poll. Additionally, 20 creators were interviewed in-depth to understand their practices and challenges.The findings show that they struggle to evaluate the credibility of the information they encounter online before sharing it. About 42 percent of respondents admitted they rely on the number of likes and shares a piece of content receives to determine its accuracy.The survey also highlighted that 59 percent of creators are unfamiliar with legal frameworks and international digital regulations. Just over half said they were aware of training programmes on this topic, but only 13.9 percent expressed an interest in attending such sessions.A lack of knowledge about fact-checking processes leaves some content creators vulnerable to legal uncertainties, potentially leading to sanctions or prosecution in some countries.Of the respondents, 26 percent said they create content to share knowledge, 23.8 percent to earn income, and 23.4 percent for entertainment purposes.Most of the shared content was based on personal experiences (58.1 percent), personal research (38.7 percent), and news sources (36 percent). Topics primarily revolved around lifestyle, beauty, travel, food and gaming. Instagram (34 percent), Facebook (25 percent), TikTok (16.4 percent), and YouTube (9 percent) were the most commonly used platforms.Audrey Azoulay, UNESCO director-general, noted that digital content creators have acquired an important place in the information ecosystem, engaging millions of people with cultural, social or political news.“But many are struggling in the face of disinformation and online hate speech and calling for more training. As part of its mandate for media and information literacy, UNESCO will support them through the first-ever global training course,” she added.Azoulay added that UNESCO is committed to supporting those who seek training on verifying information before publishing it.UNESCO’s first global fact-checking training programme was launched this month, with 9,000 participants from 160 countries.-In Association with ANN \nSudurpaschim Royals posted a formidable target of 183-run against Biratnagar Kings in the ongoing Nepal Premier League match at Tribhuvan University International Cricket Ground, Kirtipur, on Tuesday.Despite early setbacks, the Royals set a challenging target, largely due to Captain Dipendra Singh Airee’s brilliant knock of 57 not out from just 24 balls, which included three fours and five sixes.The innings began on a shaky note, with the Royals losing Amit Shrestha (1) early, caught by Martin Guptill off Ismat Alam in the second over. Binod Bhandari (23) and Brandon McMullen (36) steadied the ship, but both fell to Anil Kharel, with Bhandari caught by Pratis GC and Brandon McMullen dismissed similarly. Aarif Sheikh (9) and Saif Zaib (14) also departed quickly, as the Royals struggled at 69-4 by the 11th over.However, Airee’s aggressive stroke play turned the game in favour of the Royals. His rapid-fire innings included a flurry of boundaries and sixes, providing the necessary acceleration in the latter stages. Ishan Pandey (21) also contributed to the cause before being run out.Scott Kuggeleijn (10) and Basant Khatri (4) added brief cameos, but it was Airee who took charge, guiding the Royals to a competitive total. The Royals finished their innings at 182-7. \nDuring monsoon last year, the Chandannath Municipality of Jumla district reported several cases of dengue. The local unit has reported cases of infection from the deadly virus this year too.Although most cases were locally transmitted, health workers in the district don’t consider the virus spread a serious public health problem. This is because Jumla is among the coldest places in the country, with temperatures dipping to subzero levels in the winter.Studies, however, show a disturbing development.“My study shows the presence of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes and their larvae in Chandannath Municipality,” said Buddhi Ram Oli, a PhD scholar at the Central Department of Zoology of the Tribhuvan University. “Chandannath Municipality is located at an elevation of 2,438 metres, and this is the first time that dengue virus-spreading mosquitoes and their larvae have been found at such a high altitude.”Earlier, vectors spreading the deadly disease were recorded only up to 2,100 metres.Local residents and health officials serving in Jumla are aware of the presence of vectors spreading deadly diseases and growing number of infections. But they don’t take the issue seriously, thinking that the vectors cannot survive long due to the climatic conditions of the region.“We once met officials at District Health Office Jumla and discussed launching an awareness drive and destroying breeding sites of mosquitoes,” said Chhatra Bahadur Mahat, health coordinator at the Chandannath Municipality. “But neither does the health office provide a budget for such programmes nor does the local unit allocate any funds. So we couldn’t do anything.”Along with Jumla, all districts across the country have recorded dengue infections this year.Oli, who carried out vector surveillance, said that, as in Chandannath Municipality, health workers at other local units too have not taken the risk of the virus-spread seriously.Experts say the country’s health workers and health facilities are ill prepared to cope with the emerging public health challenges brought about by climate change. Several health facilities were overwhelmed with dengue patients this year, too. Due to a lack of beds, patients were forced to sleep in corridors, on the floor, on chairs, in storerooms, and out in the hospital compound. Hospitals even lacked basic supplies like IV stands, and patients’ visitors had to hold the IV bags or health workers had to improvise by tying them to windows.Experts say the deadly virus outbreak in most mountain districts and all hill districts shows the impact of climate change on Nepal’s healthcare system. Despite these challenges, no effective mitigation measures have been adopted.Many hospitals are overwhelmed with an influx of patients, and health workers are forced to place seriously ill patients in corridors and other makeshift spaces, compromising patient safety.“Our health facilities are not equipped to endure the climate crisis,” said Dr Meghnath Dhimal, chief researcher at the Nepal Health Research Council. “Many are built on hilltops or riverbanks and are vulnerable to climate impacts. These health facilities are also unprepared for emerging problems and surges in patient flow.”Experts say climate change, along with some other factors, such as increased mobility and improved transportation, has been contributing to the spread of deadly diseases in places considered no-risk zones in the past.“The rise in the temperature caused by climate change provides a conducive environment for dengue vectors to thrive and spread in the mountainous areas,” said Dhimal. “Risks posed by climatic factors cannot be ignored or underestimated.”A report by the United Nations titled ‘Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability’ states that at least six major vector-borne diseases have recently emerged in Nepal and are now considered endemic, with climate change implicated as the primary driver.The report also showed increasing evidence that climate change has extended the elevational distribution of Anopheles, Culex and Aedes mosquitoes, which carry viruses to above 2,000 metres in Nepal.Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. According to the World Health Organisation, the same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and the Zika virus.So far, 12 people have died due to dengue and over 29,000 have been infected since the start of 2024 if the government data is to be believed. Experts say reported dengue cases may only represent a small fraction of the true scale of the outbreak, as around 90 percent of the infected people do not show any symptoms and health authorities often conceal the actual number of deaths and infections.This year, districts in Tarai region reported fewer cases of dengue infection than districts in the hills and mountains. Experts attribute this to the residents of Tarai’s becoming more aware of the deadly virus and taking preventive measures. High temperatures (above 35 degrees Celsius) could also have contributed to less infection, as mosquito vectors do not survive above 35 degrees Celsius.Over the past few years, dengue has become a year-round threat in Nepal, with cases consistently on the rise. \nManufacturers and exporters say they are in a dilemma over trade with India following the restrictive measures imposed by New Delhi on Nepali goods. Making matters worse is the Nepali government’s silence even though the goods have not been sold to India for months.Dol Raj Adhikari, president of the Nepal Sanitary and Diaper Association, said sanitary pads and diapers worth of Rs250 million had been stranded in the warehouses for the past three months.“We completed all the processes to acquire the Bureau of Indian Standards [BIS] certificate to export our products, but no team from India is coming to inspect the factory. We even wrote to the Indian authority multiple times but our requests have fallen on deaf ears.”As per the provision, once the Indian inspection team gives a green signal after factory inspection, goods can be exported to India.In 2020, the Indian government asked the BIS to prescribe mandatory standards for imported goods in line with international quality norms. The move aimed to prevent Chinese goods from entering India from any of its neighbours.After the suppression of Chinese apps, the Indian government imposed import restrictions on more than 370 Chinese products. Insiders say India does not want any products from Nepal that have Chinese components, including Nepal’s hydroelectricity, greatly worrying Nepal’s top exporters.The BIS deals with the marking and certifying of goods, incorporating quality standards and information on international norms to be followed while importing.The rules worry Adhikari, who owns the AG Health Industries Private Limited that produces sanitary pads and diapers in Bhairahawa. “India seems intent to halt imports from Nepal,” said Adhikari. According to the association, Nepal used to export three truckloads of sanitary pads and diapers daily. There are 29 sanitary pads and diaper factories in Nepal, both large and small, employing 6,000 workers.Sanitary pads and diaper factories used to operate 12 hours a day when the demand boomed, but due to the export obstacles, factories have reduced operating hours by 4 hours, said Adhikari.According to the Department of Customs, Nepal exported 201.99 million pieces of sanitary pads and diapers worth Rs719 million to India in the last fiscal year, ending mid-July.Likewise, a big consignment of Goldstar shoes failed to get export clearance after India refused to issue the BIS certificate, putting Nepal’s homegrown shoemaker on the brink.Exporters said there were rumours on Friday that India had extended the deadline to obtain a BIS certificate, and the Nepali exporters were allowed to export goods with their existing certificates.“But we have not received any formal notice from the Indian authority on the time extension of the BIS certificate,” said Baburam Adhikari, spokesperson for the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies. “If the BIS had made such a decision, we would have been informed.”“Neither the BIS India nor the domestic industries has confirmed or communicated with us on the issue.”After Nepali exports were halted over the BIS issue, the industry ministry has written multiple times to its Indian counterpart. Meetings were held, and the issue was forwarded even during Industry Minister Damodar Bhandari’s visit to India in August. “However, there is no progress,” said Adhikari. Adhikari said none of the Nepali exporters who applied for the BIS certificate have gotten it till now.“The BIS certificate issue has put the industries in Rupandehi in a big dilemma. They were opened to export goods to India,” said Thakur Kumar Shrestha, president of the Siddhartha Chamber of Commerce and Industry. It has negatively impacted both the industries and Nepal’s trade.Shrestha said factories are either running at half capacity or getting shut down, and workers are being laid off. Exports from the cement makers in Rupandehi—such as Arghakhanchi Cement, Sarbottam Cement, Palpa Cement, and Balaji Cement—have completely stopped for nearly two months.“Even as the domestic consumption of cement declined, production was not impacted due to the huge demand from India. But now cement plants in Rupandehi are on the verge of shutting down or running under-capacity,” said Shrestha.Except plywood, the export of all the listed goods that require a BIS certificate has come to a halt, said Shrestha. “India has neither renewed the certificate nor provided a new one.”Goods under the BIS with compulsory certification are any variety of cement manufactured or sold in India, steel and iron products, chemicals, fertiliser, polymers and textiles, cables, flat transparent sheet glass, cattle feed, footwear, centrifugally cast (spun) iron pipes, jute bags, viscose staple fibres, geo textiles, portable water bottles, plywood, and wooden flush door shutters, among others.“Plywood is currently not restricted. But despite having already paid the BIS charges and completed the process, the inspection team from India has not provided a BIS certificate for Nepali goods,” said Hom Prasad Ghimire, president of the Nepal Plywood Manufacturers Association. Ghimire said that his company completed the process of getting the BIS certificate in June. He said the Nepali plywood is of better quality than the Indian plywood.Plywood has been given until March 2025 for certification-free export. He said that out of 80 plywood factories, 52 have even deposited charges to obtain the certificate. The plywood industry employs 25,000 workers across the country.According to the association, Nepal exported Rs8 billion worth of plywood to India. The volume could have increased had the exports not been interrupted.Trade with India has been repeatedly obstructed. Experts say there is a need to seek long-term solutions for uninterrupted trade with the southern neighbour. “There must be a mutual recognition agreement on select exportable items. Under such an agreement, exportable goods certified by the government will be recognised by the Indian government. This would be the best long-term solution for standard certification,” said Posh Raj Pandey, chairman of the South Asia Watch of Economics, Environment and Trade.Under the 2009 bilateral trade agreement with Nepal, India agreed to support the setting up of standard-purpose labs, said Pandey. However, Nepal has not been able to push for the labs during talks with India— even after 15 years of the agreement. He said lack of coordination among government agencies and frequent changes of bureaucrats have put the issue on the back burner. \nThe US has just concluded our generation's most eagerly watched presidential elections. Donald J Trump has won the White House resoundingly, and in addition, the Republican Party, also known as the Grand Old Party, has now wrested control of the Senate and has a comfortable majority in Congress. Simply put, Trump and the GOP now have complete control of the executive and legislative branches of the government, which will embolden the new Trump administration to pursue policies with determination. The world is closely watching how the Trump administration will usher in a new foreign policy paradigm that revolves around Trump’s “America First” philosophy. Foreign policy mandarins across the globe have mixed feelings about Trump's victory: Allies in Europe are gripped with anxiety, whereas in South Asia, there is a sense that since the rhetoric of Trump’s election campaign focused on combating China, Asia is on the cusp of witnessing unprecedented American engagement. It is in this context of American outreach in Asia that South Asia will play a pivotal role in shaping outcomes of a constantly evolving new world order. Nepal must remain steadfast in keeping up with developments of the great power games whilst constantly safeguarding and pursuing its interests independently. The heart of the US’s contention with China revolves around two critical issues: Trade and technology. The Covid-19 pandemic demonstrated to the world how global trade supply chains depended on supply lines in China. With the resurgence of the America First policy, the Trump administration is determined to impose new trade tariffs of up to 60 percent on Chinese exports. While the supposed new tariffs are likely to come into play in the second half of 2025, there is palpable fear that new trade tariffs could bring in disruptions to global trade as costs are likely to increase in the coming days. The Trump administration is determined to create new jobs to revitalise the economy by incentivising manufacturing in the country. Whilst Trump's plan to re-establish the US as a manufacturing hub is seen as a patriotic move, could higher labour costs in a developed country contribute towards lower production costs? The US’s trade conflict with China presents other developing nations in Asia with a unique opportunity to attract investments in the manufacturing industry. Although it is outlandish to suggest China will be entirely substituted as a manufacturing hub, the emergence of new manufacturing opportunities in the global south presents the US with the opportunity to fuel economic growth essential for the sustenance of democracy. South Asia gives the US a unique avenue for enhanced collaboration. With a democratic polity spread across most of South Asia’s landmass, job creation and energy production are the key elements for stability in the region. The Indo-Gangetic delta is among the most populous regions in the world and possesses the human capital to fuel economic growth across South Asia. Although the Civilian Nuclear Deal between India and the US is a milestone agreement for the use of clean nuclear energy to generate electricity in India, the nuclear plants in India only contribute 3.11 percent of the total electricity generated in India. For India to meet the energy requirements to set up a large-scale industrial base, access to high-quality uninterrupted energy will be critical for industrialisation in India and across South Asia. The Millennium Challenge Corporation pact signed between Nepal and the US is a significant breakthrough in Nepal’s energy sector, as American investment in upgrading transmission line infrastructure is greatly required to transport high-quality, uninterrupted energy.Nepal still requires robust investment in the transmission side to feed supply lines across South Asia. The fact that Nepal, Bangladesh and India have signed a power trade agreement demonstrates the potential of Nepal’s energy sector in fuelling energy to propel economic growth in the region. South Asia missed the industrial flight back in the decades of the 80s and the 90s; it’s time the region reaped the benefits of the US capital that could trigger a wave of industrialisation. Another focal point of tension between the US and China is the issue of semiconductors. The US would want to retain the technological leadership of high-end chips in the hands of its allies, namely Taiwan, South Korea and the Netherlands. Currently, the world relies solely on Taiwan and its crown jewel, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC), for high-end chips—TSMC has a market share of 90 percent of advanced chip manufacturing. Both the US and China know the strategic advantage one can gain by accessing high-end chips, which is critical for next-generation AI modelling in sectors such as defence, intelligence, telecom, medicine and aerospace. The ability to store big data also depends on the quality and the advanced functioning of high-end chips. In simple words, the US’s ability to retain control and contain access to high-end chips to compete whilst diversifying the production of low-end chips will provide the US and its allies the political leverage it desperately wants. The tech industry in South Asia has been recognised as a force to reckon with, particularly in India and the periphery of Bangladesh. Sri Lanka seems to have made progress, while Nepal also aspires to expand its tech business reach. Cross-border payments, the expansion of data centres and the use of technology in the delivery of governance are areas of expansive collaboration. India’s ability to produce low-end chips in the future is also critical to expanding the tech industry in South Asia, as indigenously produced chips can help reduce manufacturing costs and the tech industry’s dependency on accessing chips elsewhere, which are always in high demand globally. But there are also areas of concern for South Asia regarding Trump’s ascendency to the White House. Trump has vowed to pull out of the Paris Climate Agreement and climate change is an issue that confronts South Asia, particularly Nepal. Nepal has witnessed firsthand the impacts of climate change and, therefore, the country and South Asia at large cannot afford to ignore the impact of climate change. This issue cannot become secondary for either Nepal or the region. Climate change challenges the livelihoods of our people, and the Government of Nepal must voice its concern visibly and work towards creating strategic alliances that will compel the new US administration to rethink walking away from Paris Climate Agreement. The new US administration and its South Asian partners must work on issues impacting human welfare to achieve wider social and economic participation in the democratic process in the region. Trump’s vision of America First is virtuous, but to restore the US’s trust globally, he must take its allies into confidence.  \nHow big will the impact be as Nepal’s major international airport closes for ten hours starting Friday?Economists say it’s too early to quantify, but the losses for the Nepali economy will be huge.Nepal’s economic momentum has slowed down since the late September floods, and the government’s decision to close the key airport could stifle growth.“It will be a big setback for the country’s ailing economy as it will hit tourism and business activities, including transport, hotels, restaurants, telecommunication and other sectors,” said Bishwambhar Pyakurel, a noted economist. Pyakurel called it a deliberate “restriction” imposed by the government, despite it having many alternatives to carry out construction at the airport.Tickets prices are soaring, with most destinations, including Nepal’s labour markets, witnessing a fourfold price rise due to a widening gap between supply and demand.A notice to airmen, popularly known as NOTAM, issued by the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, states that the airport will be closed from 10pm to 8am from Friday for five months, until March 31, to expand the taxiways. The airport is currently closed from 2am to 6am. Two parallel taxiway projects are ongoing at the Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu. The extension of the parallel taxiway was initially planned in 2009.Travel trade entrepreneurs said the civil aviation body’s mismanagement could shave off at least Rs50 billion in airline and tourism industry revenues, even as the government struggles with revenue generation.The outlooks for 2024-2025 of the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the International Monetary Fund forecast economic recovery on the basis of improved tourist arrivals in Nepal. Growth in food, transport, and accommodation sectors have been better than expected even as other economic indicators lag.In September, the Asian Development Bank revised Nepal’s economic growth forecast upward to 4.9 percent for the current fiscal year beginning mid-July, based on projected agricultural and electricity output growth and buoyant tourist arrivals.The National Statistics Office’s annual account estimated that accommodation and food service activities, which are linked to tourism, would see a robust growth of 21.84 percent, the highest among 18 economic compositions in the Nepali economy, in the last fiscal year ended mid-July.According to the respective ministries, the late monsoon floods and landslides affected agriculture and electricity output, and now tourism has received a big jolt.It will be more painful for domestic airlines as winter will bring more fog and pollution, curtailing flight frequencies.“It’s an unplanned construction,” said Pyakurel. “Today, time is money. For trading, business and leisure, coming to Nepal will be a big challenge,” he said, adding that the airfares are so high that tourists and businessmen will think twice before flying. Hoteliers say that due to high ticket prices, key events planned in Kathmandu have either been postponed or cancelled.As part of the improvement plan, a 1,140-metre-long parallel taxiway is being built on the runway’s southern side, or the Koteshwar end. This will connect the existing international apron to the end of runway 02.Similarly, another 450-metre-long parallel taxiway is being built at the northern end of the runway.Considering the planned infrastructure, the maximum runway capacity will see 42 aircraft movements per hour in mixed-mode operation, enabling 187,000 aircraft movements per year from the 128,449 flight movements last year. In 2023, the Kathmandu airport recorded 8.7 million passengers—4.54 million international air travellers and 4.15 million domestic ones, according to statistics of the Tribhuvan International Airport.Similarly, in terms of flight movement, the airport handled 128,449 flight movements—31,460 flights by international airlines and 96,989 by domestic carriers.Travel trade entrepreneurs say the ill-planned construction would take way too long, extending until another peak tourism season in spring (March).“These will be painful months for travel trade entrepreneurs as the plan is being implemented in the peak tourism season. We, however, cannot oppose the airport’s infrastructure development,” said Sagar Pandey, president of the Trekking Agencies Association of Nepal.“On different occasions, we have suggested that the government and the civil aviation body find alternatives to such a long closure, such as incentivising airlines to fly from Bhairahawa and Pokhara international airports.”However, international airlines are hesitant to connect to the new airports, which have remained idle for months due to the technical and financial issues of flying to them.Pandey said they might lose at least 40 percent of trekkers this year considering the flight cancellations.Nepal Tourism Board has revised its 2024 tourist arrival forecast to 1.1 million from the projected 1.3 million. As of October, Nepal has received 900,000 tourists.Some entrepreneurs say that five hours of construction time, as it used to be, was appropriate, but insiders suspect that a 10-hour closure would force many airlines to divert to Bhairahawa. For instance, on October 27, the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) took action against a Thai AirAsia flight, refusing to allow it to land at Kathmandu airport.Media reports show that the flight was later permitted. However, after the plane landed, authorities temporarily suspended the airline and its general sales agent. Later the restrictions were lifted on the “condition” that the airline would fly from Bhairahawa as well. Airline officials say the “punitive measure” was not the aviation regulator’s first action. On October 30, 2022, the CAAN cancelled Nepal Airlines’ scheduled flight to Delhi as punishment for defying instructions to move some of its international services to the newly-built Bhairahawa airport.Nepal Airlines’ jet remained on the ground, and more than 500 passengers were affected by the last-minute cancellation.“I would like to seriously draw the attention of the government that Tribhuvan International Airport is being closed for 10 hours daily from November 8 to March 31. It cannot be considered normal to close an international airport for 10 hours to build structures. Earlier, during the rehabilitation of the main runway, the airport was closed only for 5/7 hours at night,” lawmaker Udaya Shumsher Rana wrote on X on October 29.“It is clear that closing the Kathmandu airport means diverting flights to Pokhara and Bhairahawa to show that those two airports are fine. There are technical reasons behind international airlines not being ready to fly to these two airports. Undoubtedly, the Civil Aviation Authority leadership is trying to hide its weaknesses by closing the Kathmandu airport for 10 hours.”Rana argued that if this decision is not revised, Nepal’s global image and tourism business would suffer. The airport closure will also hit domestic flights. Buddha Air, Nepal’s largest domestic carrier, currently operates 180 daily flights. As the airline must reduce its flights to 135, there will be a substantial drop in its revenue and government’s taxes. Some other domestic airlines have complained to the regulator that flight allocation is not proportionate under the new arrangement. \n\n\nRae was the envoy to Kathmandu during the promulgation of the 2015 constitution and the subsequent blockade. In this conversation, Rae talks about the evolution of Nepal-India ties since the blockade, regional geopolitics, what the two countries get wrong about each other, how New Delhi views Nepali communist parties and the governments they lead, and the change (if any) in India’s neighbourhood policy since the start of Narendra Modi’s third term in office. \nKunwar has been the MD for just under three years. Before coming back to her homeland to join Daraz Nepal, she worked at different American companies, including Amazon, the world’s biggest e-commerce platform. In this conversation, Kunwar talks about the opportunities and challenges of running an e-commerce enterprise in Nepal, as well as the country’s overall business environment.  \nMorning walkers are often captivated by the wall of Janakpur Cigarette Factory Limited (JCFL). Despite its worn-out condition—with faded colours, peeling plaster, exposed bricks, and overgrown bushes—the wall stands out with its vibrant Mithila paintings. JCFL has been closed since July 1, 2019, and now serves as the headquarters of the Madhesh provincial government.Women are busy painting the walls, holding brushes and acrylic colours. Seated on the footpath, artist Ramita Thakur worked on a painting depicting the marriage of Ram and Sita. Alongside the artwork of the divine couple sitting on a throne, she sketched a bow to complement the scene.“Once the sketch is complete, we will add colour. It may look black and white now, but it will be stunning after it’s coloured,” says Thakur, who began painting two days ago and estimates it will take her another two days to finish.The construction of JCFL began in Janakpur in 1960 with assistance from the Soviet Union (Russia). The 64-year-old JCFL wall is currently adorned with Mithila paintings by the Madhesh provincial government. Three artists were finalising a painting on the western wall of the main gate of the Chief Minister and Council of Ministers’ office. These artists, who depicted the traditional Mithila wedding on the wall, used colours that matched their own clothing.A total of 160 Mithila paintings will be painted on 3,500 feet (1 km) of the outer wall of JCFL, which occupies 33 bigha and 9 kattha land. “All 160 paintings will be unique,” says Udit Kumar Thakur, the information officer at the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure Development under the Madhesh government. Around 50 artists have been commissioned to create the Mithila paintings. The Ministry is investing Rs2 million in constructing the outer complex of JCFL.Thakur, the information officer at the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure Development, stated that 160 Mithila paintings showcasing Mithila’s culture, lifestyle, cuisine, and diversity will be created on the wall. “The outer wall of the Madhesh government headquarters used to look unattractive,” Thakur explains. “The Mithila paintings have been added to enhance its appearance. All the artists who paint the wall are local artists from Janakpur.” Artist SC Suman began by creating Mithila paintings on mud walls. “In those days, natural colours were used for the paintings,” Suman shares. “Later, the shift to cement walls brought an increased use of acrylic colours.” He explains that while the tradition of painting on walls remains rooted in history, the medium has evolved. “Previously, the artwork primarily depicted mythological themes. Now, it also addresses contemporary issues.” \nThe Nepal Election Commission is holding local level by-elections for 41 vacant positions on Sunday. In the fray are 377 candidates, including independents, according to the commission.The by-polls are set to be held in local units across the seven provinces. The voting began at 7am and will continue till 5pm.Three of the total 44 vacant posts were elected unopposed. Now, one municipal mayor, one deputy mayor, two rural municipality chairpersons, four vice-chairpersons, and 33 ward chairpersons are up for grabs.The district coordination committee candidates in Kailali and Okhaldhunga were elected unopposed from the Nepali Congress. While Tek Raj Bhattarai in Kailali and Tika Kumari Chaudhary in Okhaldhunga of the Congress were unchallenged, CPN (Maoist Centre) candidate Jagat Gharti had no contenders for the Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality ward-2 chairperson post, according to election officials.The commission is conducting voting from 7 am to 5 pm on Sunday at the polling stations set up at respective local units where the seats have gone vacant.Nita Pokharel Aryal, spokesperson for the Election Commission, said that all preparations for the by-polls have been completed.“Special arrangements have been made to give priority to disabled, senior citizens, pregnant women and other people requiring different arrangements to cast their votes,” Aryal said. According to Aryal, those whose names are included in the final voter list can cast their votes showing the original proof of voter identity card, Nepali citizenship certificate, national identity card, passport, driving licence or permanent account number card.Commission officials expect higher voter turnout compared to earlier elections. According to an officer at the commission, the election body analysed some lapses in the past elections and fixed them. “We believe the turnout will be higher this time,” says an official.Counting of votes will begin immediately after the voting is completed, and all the ballot boxes will be collected at the designated counting centres. The commission has said that the count can be followed on its website.The commission plans to announce the final by-election results within two days.“We expect to use a helicopter to collect ballot boxes of Gaurishankar Rural Municipality of Dolakha due to the difficult geography of the village,” Durga Prasad Chalise, the deputy spokesperson for the commission said.“It may take some time to collect ballot boxes in Sarkegad Rural Municipality of Humla and Swamikartik Khapar Rural Municipality of Bajura, but other than that, we will have no problem starting vote counting immediately.”The commission is holding by-elections as per the legal provision. According to the Local Level Election Act-2017, if the position of the district coordination committee chief, deputy chief, rural municipality chairman, vice-chairman, municipality mayor, deputy mayor and ward chair fall vacant for any reason before the end of their term and if more than a year of their term remains, the remaining term will be filled through a by-election.The elections are being held only to elect 41 representatives at local units but political parties have given priority to the by-polls as if it is going to be a test of their strength.Even top politicians such as CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, Nepali Congress general secretaries Gagan Thapa and Bishwa Prakash Sharma and CPN-UML General Secretary Shankar Pokharel, among other influential leaders, were actively involved in election campaigns in favour of their candidates.Some reckon people could express their disenchantment towards traditional parties because of their inability to deliver on governance. But Uddhab Pyakurel, an assistant professor at the Kathmandu University, said the by-elections can’t be seen as a voice of the Nepali people at large.Pyakurel thinks that regular elections are different to by-elections and by-elections results seldom reflect on future election results.Sunday’s by-elections are taking place only for the 41 posts of certain local units. There are 753 local units (276 municipalities and 460 rural municipalities), further divided into 6,743 wards.“So the results of the 41 local contests are insufficient to draw definite conclusions about the future,” Pyakurel said. It could be an indicator to analyse anti-incumbency if the parties lose the seats that they had won earlier, he added. “However, the results themselves cannot be considered a solid basis to gauge the future poll performance of political parties.”Out of the 44 seats for which by-elections are being held on Sunday, 30 were won by the Congress in the earlier local polls while seven seats each were won by the UML and the Maoist Centre. \nNepali Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa, until recently a sharp critic of party president Sher Bahadur Deuba, now seems to be on the same page with the party chief.As the two leaders inch closer, Deuba has been entrusting Thapa with decision-making on major issues and the latter seems to be enjoying working closely with the veteran leader. Thapa stood against Deuba’s re-election as the party chief during the 14th general convention held in December 2021 in Kathmandu. Against Deuba’s bid for the second consecutive tenure, Thapa supported Shekhar Koirala. While Deuba defeated Koirala to retain the post, Thapa and another youth leader Bishwa Prakash Sharma were elected to the two posts of general secretaries from different panels.In December 2022, Koirala and Thapa again teamed up to challenge Deuba while electing the parliamentary party leader. Thapa gave his candidacy against Deuba, only to be defeated by a huge margin.Thapa did not give up. In February last year, Thapa again challenged Deuba by presenting a proposal at the Mahasamiti meeting and strongly advocated the idea of not forging any alliance for the elections.Thapa’s proposal came after the Congress decision to enter an electoral alliance with the CPN (Maoist Centre) and the CPN (Unified Socialist) in November 2022 was severely criticised by the party members.By presenting a separate proposal on the issue at the Mahasamiti meeting, which is taken as a policy-making body of the party, Thapa tried to lead on key policy issues.Despite the Mahasamiti meeting endorsing his proposal, leaders close to Deuba were against the proposal.The central committee meeting of the party in August also came to a decision close to Thapa’s proposal of not allying with other parties. While the proposal was partially endorsed, the meeting concluded by saying, “an alliance related to the election will be decided based on needs of the particular time”.Thapa also was against the party chief when Deuba decided to forge the alliance with CPN-UML, the second largest party in the House of Representatives, to form the government led by UML chief KP Sharma Oli on July 1. But Thapa, who had long been challenging Deuba, has recently developed close relations with the party president. The two leaders have been closely working to settle key issues related to the government and foreign affairs. Of late, Deuba has given Thapa important roles in inter-party negotiations and other tasks.Recently, Deuba picked Thapa over other leaders in the two-party task force formed to set the agenda for Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s China visit scheduled to start on December 2.Thapa also represents the largest party in another task force cobbled together to discuss Nepal’s proposals on the BRI Implementation Plan, where the UML is represented by Prime Minister Oli’s political adviser Bishnu Rimal and financial adviser Yubaraj Khatiwada. Earlier, ruling partners Congress and UML formed a task force to formulate the common minimum programme of the coalition government. While deputy general secretaries duo Pradeep Gyawali and Bishnu Rimal were taskforce members from the UML, Thapa and Prakash Sharan Mahat were the members from the Congress.Although they seem to be on the same page, party president Deuba and general secretary Thapa still have differences, says a party leader. The leader argued that the current situation has compelled party chief Deuba to work in coordination with Thapa as none of his other trusted leaders is as accomplished in getting things done. Besides, according to the leader, Deuba may be trying to create a bigger space in the party for his wife Arzu Rana Deuba, who is currently a foreign minister in the Oli Cabinet.It is not only on the BRI that Thapa has been involved as a key negotiator; he also played a crucial role to resolve the long-drawn dispute in the parliamentary endorsement of the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) compact in February 2022. Thapa was one of the key interlocutors in finding a way out in the MCC imbroglio when he helped to devise a 12-point interpretive declaration. This was at the time of a heated debate on whether to endorse the MCC compact through Parliament that had gripped the country.Despite playing a vital role in the compact’s parliamentary endorsement, the rapport between Deuba and Thapa did not last. So, many leaders still argue, it would be too early to say that the Deuba-Thapa partnership will endure this time.The party's publicity department head, Min Bahadur Bishwakarma, claimed that relations between the two leaders soured after Thapa decided to form his own camp. However, at present, an atmosphere of trust has developed between party chief Deuba and Thapa, Bishwakarma says. “The party president has a good relationship not only with Thapa but also another general secretary, Bishwa Prakash Sharma,” said Bishwakarma.Relations between Deuba and Thapa seem to have grown cordial compared to the past, and a few factors have contributed to this, says Geja Sharma Wagle, a longtime Congress watcher and a political analyst. “In recent years, Thapa has established himself as a leader who can shoulder challenges, a leader with vision and strategy,” Wagle said. “Thapa also has proven that he has the political acumen to pull the party out of difficult situations.”In Wagle’s reckoning, Deuba took Thapa into confidence after Thapa expressed his willingness to shoulder greater responsibility and come up with solutions on pressing issues. He is also ready to tackle the challenges posed by the emergence of a new party, adds Wagle, besides having a solid understanding of the party organisation.Thapa’s growing intimacy with Deuba means that his distance from Shekhar Koirala has increased. So far, Thapa and Koirala have jointly led the party’s rival faction and often challenged the party establishment on certain issues.“Maintaining a distance from Koirala could be Thapa’s tactical move,” says another leader of the party who is close to both Koirala and Thapa. “While contesting the election of parliamentary party leader against Deuba in late 2022, Thapa had agreed to support Koirala for the position of party chief in the upcoming general convention.”Working closely with party chief Deuba comes with both pros and cons for Thapa. Deuba has already declared his intent not to contest party presidency in the next general convention. The party statute stipulates a two-term limit for the party chief, and Deuba has already been president twice. Koirala, however, is preparing to contest for the party president.There are a number of second-rung leaders from Deuba’s camp who have been supporting the party chief, expecting his backing in their race for the party’s top post. If Thapa gets close to Deuba, they will feel betrayed by Deuba. In that case, Thapa may also lose out on the support of the old Koirala-Thapa camp.A former general secretary of the party says it would be premature to analyse the effect of the current working relations between Deuba and Thapa in the upcoming general convention. Should Thapa get close to Deuba, as reported, Thapa could face questions from his supporters. “Thapa established himself by asking hard questions of the party establishment including Deuba,” says another party leader. “How can he now be seen surrendering to the same leader?”But speaking with the Post on the condition of anonymity, other party leaders said that in the contest for the party leadership, strategy will prevail ethics. One of Thapa’s core interests in working closely with Deuba is to hold the party’s next general convention on time, they said. They also claimed that General Secretary Sharma and some leaders like Pradip Paudel are with Thapa on the agenda of a timely convention. But Bishwakarma, the publicity department chief, said that the growing closeness between Deuba and Thapa had nothing to do with the next general convention. \nFormer home minister and chief of Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) Rabi Lamichhane, who has been held in Kaski police custody for investigations, was brought to Kathmandu on Thursday evening for probe in a cooperative fraud case registered with the Kathmandu District Police.Lamichhane is being investigated on charges of cooperatives fraud, organised crime, and money laundering. He was allegedly involved in a fraud case involving the Kalimati-based Swarnalakshmi Cooperative.According to police officials, Lamichhane was transferred to Kathmandu after recording his statement on the charges of embezzling deposits borrowed from the Suryadarshan Cooperative in Pokhara.The Kathmandu District Court issued an arrest warrant against Lamichhane on November 17 for his alleged role in misappropriating funds from the Swarnalakshmi Cooperative.An arrest warrant was also issued against former DIG Chhabilal Joshi, one of the partners of Lamichhane in Gorkha Media Network, in connection with the Swarnalakshmi case. Joshi’s statement was recorded at the District Attorney’s Office in Kathmandu.The Kaski Court on November 24 extended his remand by an additional 15 days for further investigation. Lamichhane had been in custody for over 40 days when the latest remand was granted. While investigations in Kaski focus on cooperatives fraud, organised crime, and money laundering, Lamichhane is also implicated in similar cases involving Butwal's Supreme Cooperative and was previously questioned by the Rupandehi District Attorney’s Office.Following his statement in Kathmandu, Lamichhane will be returned to Kaski. Additionally, arrest warrants have been issued against Lamichhane and others in Chitwan.Lamichhane was apprehended by a Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) team from the RSP’s central office in Banasthali, Kathmandu on October 18, and transported to Pokhara for investigation. Previous probes including the one conducted by a special parliamentary committee alleged that he, as the managing director of the the now-defunct Gorkha Media Network, was involved in diverting funds from multiple cooperatives, including Rs30 million, into personal accounts. \nNepali Congress candidate Krishnaman Dangol has been elected mayor of Kirtipur Municipality in the by-election held on Sunday.

The arrested is Harichandra Phuyal alias Navin Pradhan, 36, a resident of Panchthar, and currently residing in ward 13 of Mechinagar Municipality, Jhapa.According to police, Phuyal used Indian phone numbers to make calls and send messages to businesspersons, claiming to represent the gang. He allegedly terrorised them by demanding they apologise to controversial medical entrepreneur Durga Prasai, warning of dire consequences, including threats to their lives. The Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) apprehended Pradhan in Charaali, Jhapa, on Wednesday evening. Police investigations revealed that Pradhan acted under Prasai’s instructions. Authorities said Pradhan has a history of criminal involvement and was previously on the run. Two mobile phones were seized during the arrest, and further investigation is ongoing.  \nPolice have arrested two individuals on charges of fraudulently promising foreign employment.A police team from the Kathmandu Valley Crime Investigation Office arrested 39-year-old Suvarna Kumar Bal of Bakaiya Rural Municipality-5 in Makwanpur and 28-year-old Manisha Kumari of Brahmapuri Rural Municipality-3 in Sarlahi.According to the complaints with the police, Suvarna had promised to send one individual to Croatia, collecting Rs1.5 million, while Manisha had promised to send another person to Dubai, collecting Rs245,000. Both individuals went into hiding after taking the money.Suvarna was arrested from Bafal on Monday, and Manisha was apprehended from Gongabu Bus Park area, Kathmandu on Tuesday. They have been sent to the Department of Foreign Employment in Tahachal for further investigation and action. \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli, leading a high-level delegation, departed for Beijing on Monday via a special diplomatic flight operated by Himalaya Airlines.The President of Himalaya Airlines, Zhou Enyong, welcomed the prime minister on board.

According to the international Air Quality Index Scale, an index value of 300 or higher results is “hazardous” to health and Pakistan has regularly tipped over 1,000 on the scale.Around two million people visited medical facilities across Punjab with breathing problems and other respiratory diseases in a month as record-breaking smog choked the province.The Ipsos survey, titled “Smog in Pakistan: Awareness, Perceptions and Practices” and dated November 26, was conducted from Nov 18 to 22 using computer-assisted telephone interviews with a sample of 1,000 people from all four provinces and Islamabad.In its first section on people’s awareness and experience with smog, data showed that eight in 10 people, around 79 per cent of the sample size, experienced smog over the last month, with 100pc of the sample in Lahore experiencing it.It also revealed that 68pc people reported having smog-related health issues with 71pc in urban areas and 67pc in rural.The survey also highlighted the effect of smog on daily life, stating, “Over one-third Pakistanis found their daily household activities, work life, and social events being affected by smog.”It further said that Punjab was the worst hit among all provinces, adding that Lahore and Rawalpindi were most affected.According to the second section on people’s beliefs and perceptions, when asked about the primary cause of smog, 70pc of respondents said vehicular emissions, 63pc said industrial smoke and 37pc said waste burning. About 31pc chose brick kilns and 30pc crop burning, followed by one in five who believed it was the “wrath of God”.The data showed that 44pc of the people saw a lack of public cooperation and 37pc believed enforcement of law as the barriers in combating smog and air pollution.In the last section on actions and behaviours, the data showed that eight out of 10 people agreed that they needed to play their part in combatting smog. It also said that men, elderly and highly educated Pakistanis were more willing to cooperate, indicating that those who were more informed were likely to take responsibility.When asked to choose personal actions to reduce smog, 48pc said they were ready to switch to walking, 31pc chose public transport, 29pc chose bicycles and 10pc opted for new/hybrid electric vehicles.The report stated that out of 796 people who owned vehicles, “nine in 10 Pakistanis are ready to cooperate if they were asked to repair their vehicles and get certification from the government — a clear sign for the government to play its part in this regard.”According to the survey, three in five people were satisfied with their provincial government’s approaches to battling smog. However, it found that satisfaction decreased as the education level increased, which raised concerns about the relevance, priority and effectiveness of the government’s strategies in addressing smog.-In Association with ANN \nAlthough abortion was legalised in Nepal in 2002, unsafe abortions are still rampant in many places throughout the country, and women are denied services, a new report shows.According to the report prepared by Center for Research on Environment Health and Population Activities (CREHPA), and the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), one in 10 women seeking abortions at health facilities was denied care. Moreover, four in 10 women (42 percent) with more than 10 weeks of pregnancy or who were unaware of their gestational age were denied an abortion. “The most common reason for denial was advanced gestation age, with over 80 percent of denials attributed to this factor,” reads the report. “Denial doesn’t stop abortion; it drives women to seek alternatives. Sixty percent of women who were denied services by authorised health facilities attempted to end their pregnancies elsewhere.”Nepal legalised abortion in 2002, marking a milestone for women’s reproductive rights, their empowerment, and bodily autonomy. With legalisation, persecution and jail terms for women who terminated unwanted pregnancies ended, and unsafe abortions decreased significantly.However, the new report shows a vast gap in services, which forced women to opt for alternatives, including unsafe means.“Thirty-eight percent of women who were denied services turned to unsafe/unapproved sites for subsequent abortions,” the report stated. “Seventy-three percent of women who were denied abortion services were, in fact, legally eligible for abortion.”Access to abortion services varied based on women’s characteristics. Those under the age of 25 years, unmarried, childless, not working outside the home, of lower wealth, or seeking abortion solely for sex selection were more likely to be denied abortion. Additionally, women who were unaware of the legal status of abortion services also experienced higher rates of denial.The study was carried out on 1,841 women seeking abortion services from 22 government-approved health facilities in all seven provinces, including major cities—Kathmandu Valley, Pokhara, Chitwan, Butwal, Nepalgunj Kailali, Kanchanpur, Biratnagar, Jhapa among others.‘This study shows that progressive abortion laws alone are not enough to guarantee access to safe abortion for all women,” said Dr Mahesh Puri, principal investigator of the study. “Young women, those with lower educational backgrounds, and women from marginalised groups (such as the Dalit) are disproportionately affected by denials, perpetuating cycles of poverty and poor health.”Women who were denied abortion care reported substantial economic hardship, with increased rates of inadequate household income and lower labour force participation over the period of three years, according to the report.Women who are unable to receive abortion services were also less likely to achieve their personal goals. While 42 percent of women who received an abortion achieved education goals, only 31 percent of denied women did so. Similar disparities were seen in employment (54 percent vs 45 percent), child-related goals (65 percent vs 31 percent), and financial goals (66 percent vs 50 percent).Denying abortion care doesn’t only affect women; it has lasting consequences for the health of their children, according to the report. The report highlights the urgent need for targeted policies to bridge the gap between Nepal’s legal framework and the reality of service accessibility.“Ensuring that abortion services are universally accessible and affordable can help reduce economic and health disparities among Nepalese women and contribute to better outcomes for children,” reads the report.Experts say unsafe abortion is among the leading factors of maternal deaths. The study does not say anything about maternal deaths from unsafe abortions. Still, the latest census report by the National Statistics Office shows that of the total maternal deaths, six percent (37 women) had undergone abortions or suffered a miscarriage.. It is estimated that over 300,000 abortions are performed in Nepal in a year. However, the government data show only around 100,000 abortions are performed in a year at authorised health facilities. Experts say many abortion take place in unauthorised places too, which does not come into the government’s record. \nDusit Princess Kathmandu hosts a five-day trout festival showcasing 12 diverse dishes inspired by various cuisines, focusing on the health benefits of locally sourced trout.\nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nChitwan Rhinos have set a target of 162 runs against Pokhara Avengers in the ongoing Nepal Premier League (NPL) match at the Tribhuvan University Cricket Ground, Kirtipur.After losing the toss and being put to bat, Chitwan managed 161 runs for the loss of seven wickets in their allotted 20 overs. The innings was anchored by Ravi Bopara, who scored a crucial 51 runs off 38 balls, including three fours and three sixes, before being caught off Raymon Reifer’s delivery.Despite a shaky start, with Chitwan at 46-3 in 5.2 overs, captain Kushal Malla (38 off 23 balls) and Bopara stabilised the innings with a 68-run partnership for the fourth wicket. Malla struck one four and four sixes before being dismissed by Sagar Dhakal, caught by wicketkeeper Kushal Bhurtel.Deepak Bohora (2) and Hasan Ishaquille (14) fell early to Bipin Khatri, while Sohail Tanvir was dismissed for a golden duck. Luke Wenkestijn contributed 16 runs, but his dismissal to Bas de Leede left the middle order under pressure. Santosh Karki added 10 runs, while Amar Routela (12) and Sharad Vesawkar (11) remained unbeaten to guide Chitwan to a defendable total.For Pokhara, Bipin Khatri, Bas de Leede, and Raymon Reifer claimed two wickets each, with Sagar Dhakal taking one.The Avengers now face the challenge of chasing 162 to secure a win. \nChaaaiiittt…The spontaneous eruption of the sound of victory thundered through the neighbourhood of Nhyokha in the Kathmandu core. The line of a kite cut another. Looking out the window of her house, Sajani Shrestha saw children running full speed, shouting and fighting as they vied to catch the falling kite and thread. And craning her neck up to the sky, she could not count but only be mesmerised by the innumerable kites strewn across the skies of Nhyokha, Bangemudha, Indrachowk. “There would be so many kites that they entirely covered the blue of the sky, making beautiful patterns of different colours,” says the 51-year-old. “And you cannot imagine the number of times the call of chait rang in the air.”Clear blue sky and gentle westerlies, the season of kites has arrived in the Kathmandu Valley. While kites soared Kathmandu's sky mainly during Dashain, the kite season officially started in Nag Panchami (August) and ended on the Haribodhini Ekadashi (November). And from royalities to commoners, young and old all flew kites from rooftops and open grounds. Even those who did not, like Sajani, revelled in the live spectacle in the sky as kites soared and fought. With Bhimsen Thapa’s help, King Girvanyuddha flies kites The earliest written account of kite flying is believed to date to 200 BC in China. In Kathmandu, this tradition has religious and socio-cultural and environmental significance, says Tina Manandhar, lecturer of Nepalese History, Culture and Archaeology at Tribhuvan University. According to her, it is believed that kites in Kathmandu skies carry a message to the god of rain Indra that the valley's farmers have had enough rain for their crops. That is why Kathmandu farmers scolded anyone flying kites before plantation season.In an article ‘Changako Utpati Ra Bikas’ published in Gorkhapatra in 1995, historian Rajesh Gautam points to the lack of written documents indicating the exact time when kite culture was introduced in Nepal. Exploring different opinions on kite's introduction to Nepal, he writes that “some have opined the possibility that the skill and tradition of kite flying might have entered Nepal through India.” Yet some others, he writes, state that kites “came to Nepal from Japan during the time of [Rana PM] Dev Shumsher.”He concludes that most likely this tradition was introduced by Malla-era Newar traders: “But since Nepal’s relationship with Tibet and China is very old and direct, kites might have entered Nepal through the Newar traders who were engaged in the trade. One can estimate that the kite was introduced to Nepal during the (mediaeval) Malla regime.”In Social History of Nepal, TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi write that there exists documented evidence of the kite flying from the early 19th century. The authors state that Sundarananda, a contemporary poet, has mentioned that the young king Girvanyuddha Bikram Shah (r.1799-1816), with the help of Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa, flew kites from the towering temple of Taleju Bhawani, Hanumandhoka. And when the king's kite cut the kites of the youngsters, they were located and rewarded with money.In Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Sardar Bhim Bahadur Pandey states that “During the month of Kartik [October-November] young and old all flew kites,” suggesting that kite culture was ubiquitous in Kathmandu by the early twentieth century.Anticipations and preparationsKite flying in Nepal requires a kite, a lattai (a wooden spool), thread and majha (homemade adhesive prepared by boiling snail slime, rice or sago, and powdered glass from burnt electric bulbs and coated on the line to sharpen it for kite fighting).77-year-old Nirmal Man Tuladhar, an avid kite flyer and retired professor of Linguistics at the Tribhuvan University, explains how Nepali tradition of kite flying was both expensive and needing advance preparation.“In our times, it wasn’t easy to fly kites,” he says. “We had to prepare majha …And as Nepali kites are fighter kites, we mainly fought with other kites [which meant we spent a lot of threads].”This preparation needed first and foremost of passing a hurdle: securing finances and materials to fly kites. While lattai was a one-time investment that could be saved for years, kites and threads had to be replenished every time a kite was cut.“Those were the times when parents wanted us to be more focused in our studies. They only gave money [to buy kites] after immense pestering,” says 80-year-old Dwarika Nath Dhungel, former Secretary of Nepal government, speaking of the 1950s and 1960s.Biodiversity specialist and botanist Tirtha Bahadur Shrestha, 86, was born in Mahabouddha and began flying kites from 1951-52. He saved what little money he got for afternoon snacks to buy Hattimar reel, a brand of line wound in a small lattai, which was strong and sharp and where majha stuck well.Raghuji Pant, a member of parliament, also recalls the difficulty in securing money to sustain his kite flying in and around Kathmandu core in the 1960s and early 1970s. “Four to five of my kites were cut in a day,” writes the 67-year-old in his 2019 article “Changa Jastai Udi Hidne Man” published in Himalkhabar. “[This caused] the line in the spool to shorten. From Bhadra [August-September] to one to one and a half months after Dashain I spent flying kites. So, it was difficult for me to have enough kites even after getting money from grandfather, grandmother, mother and everyone.”Kites and thread secured, now began the crucial work of preparing and applying majha whose strength determined how well it cut other kites. Govinda Tandon, 70, a historian and heritage expert, who grew up in Battisputali, was also an ardent kite flyer.“Materials for making majha were prepared right from the morning on a holiday,\" he writes in his article “Dashainko Butte Changa” published in Gorkhapatra. “Because this work couldn’t be accomplished without a collaboration of 3-4 friends, a holiday was set aside for this. Moreover, a sunny day was considered appropriate. If the majha didn’t dry, the thread could turn moist, and so if it felt like the day wouldn’t be sunny, the entire plan…was aborted.”Kite makers, kite sellers and variety of kites One of the oldest shops in Kathmandu's memory, Shree Chitrakar Kite Center in Tyauda, Asan is bustling with customers during Dashain. “When my grandmother got married and came to this house at age 12 [in early 1940s], this shop was already here,” says its fourth generation owner 47-year-old Dinoj Chitrakar. “So the shop must be around a hundred years old.”Another shop that stands out in Kathmandu's memory is Manandhar Kite Center in Kalimati, established in 1949, and currently run by brothers Mohan Man and Sundar Man Manandhar.In his book Antar Taranga, artist and writer Manuj Babu Mishra recalls “a kite shop near the old halwai shop of Chabahil” in the 1940s. Dhungel and his 1960 batchmates of Juddhodaya Public School recall the kite shops from the 1950s and 1960s – Bekhacha’s Shop at Netapacho, Bhaicha’s Shop at Nhyokha, Lata Manandhar’s Shop at Maru, Kanchha Buddha Bajracharya Shop at Tyauda.Besides the shops, there were makers and sellers of kites cloistered in different localities of Kathmandu Valley.In Kwalkhu, Patan was a Joshi who made Nepali paper kites.“One day I accompanied my uncle to buy kites,\" writes Dibya Giri, 69, in his 2023 article “Changa” in Sahitya Post. “I was amazed to see the huge stacks of kites there. We used to call it the house of the kite maker.”In Nhyokha, Purna Bahadur Shrestha began making kites as a teenager and started his own kite business in the 1950s, according to his daughter Sajani.These kites, made out of Nepali paper, often had different paintings. Mishra recalls painting kites for the kite shop in Chabahil.“I went to that kite shop and with the freely available colours and Nepali papers, I spent my day painting faces, birds, animals, masks, mountains, hills, whatever came to my mind,” he writes in the book. “Such kites apparently sold well!”Most septuagenarians and older generations like Tuladhar and Tirtha Bahadur recall flying kites made of Nepali paper when young. Tirtha Bahadur says that kites from Lucknow began coming to Kathmandu only after the late 1950s. But at least a section of Kathmandu was flying kites from Lucknow from the early twentieth century. Vaidya, Manandhar and Joshi write that the Ranas and Shahs imported kites from Lucknow and that from them, their favourite employees also got to fly some. These kites were large and, in Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Pande writes that they were referred to as Lucknowia kites.Known for their characteristic hissing sound they made while flying, light body, swift movement and ability to take sharp turns, Lucknow kites were preferred by kite fighters.“Lucknow kites were lighter and could be manoeuvred well,” says Tuladhar. “Kites of Nepali paper were stable but difficult to manoeuvre. They were also expensive. So only some fighters flew Nepali paper kites.”The kites had different names depending upon their designs and colours – Ambe (a heart in the centre), Dibdibe (chequered), Pakhete (a different coloured paper on one edge), Sete (white-coloured), Nilchi (blue-coloured), Rate (red-coloured) and so on.The kite fighters preferred the strong and sharp Hattimar reel that came on a small lattai. The Belchamar reel was cheaper but weaker and prone to be cut by other threads. Kite fliers and kite watchers on rooftops and open groundsBibek Shrestha, 57, and his two brothers took stacks of kites and climbed their rooftops. The rooftops around theirs in the neighbourhood of Nhyokha – in fact in all core settlements of the Valley – were filled with kite fliers and spectators. Many risked precariously balancing on the sloped roofs.While Bibek and his brothers’ kites alighted to meet the sea of kites in the sky, their sister Sajani and other family members gathered around to revel in the live spectacle.Dhungel remembers the rooftops of Jhochhen and surroundings of the 1950s and 1960s swelled with kite fliers. Dhungel did try to fly kites. But he did not become a successful kite flyer. What he did become was, like Sajani and many Kathmandu residents, an admirer of kites soaring in the sky.“But more than engaging in my unsuccessful kite flying attempts, I enjoyed looking at the kites flying. There would be a big crowd of spectators. Females and other family members watched the kites fly as they ate meat and chiura. Some even drank and rejoiced as they flew kites.”When the age of cassette player and speakers dawned in the 1980s, songs blared from the speakers alongside kite flying. Chitrakar and Bibek invited their friends, put their favourite songs on speakers and spent entire afternoons flying kites, dancing, singing and eating.Away from the core cities, in the villages in the Valley, people flew kites in open fields. Like Dibya, who set his kite for flight from the banks of Godavari River in Tikathali. Chhauni was also a popular space for flying kites.Kathmandu’s joy in kite fightingBibek pulled his kite down and then manoeuvred it back up so his line touched his opponent's line from below and quickly reeled out his line. The resulting sharpness from the speed cut the opponent's line.Chaaaiiitttt………“The greatest fun comes from cutting another kite's string,” writes Tuladhar in his 1996 article “Cutting is the greatest fun” published in magazine Kite Lines. “With its coating of adhesive paste and ground glass, the string is as sharp and abrasive as sandpaper on your opponent's line.”Nepali kite, Tuladhar says, is made to fight other kites, and describes how a kite line cuts the other.“The technique is to touch your rival's string and immediately reel out line at high speed,” he writes. “The Nepalese style of kite flying is aggressive, and though the kites look simple, they are strategically designed for bringing down other kites.”At any given time, like Bibek’s kite above Nhyokha sky, skies above the Valley were filled with raging kites, swinging, coming down and going up as the fighters reeled in and out their lattais in ferocious attempts to bring down other kites.Meanwhile spectators cheered. “Even passersby stopped to look at the kites,” recalls Tina.The moment of a kite cutting was accompanied by the sound of chait, and children ran in the direction of the falling kite to grab it and the thread in what was termed as, Dibya says, changa lutne/dhago lutne.Dhungel always joined in to shout the chait resounding through the locality of Jhochhen and almost automatically his feet sped towards the severed kites' direction.“‘Oii leave that thread,’ the kite owner would scold me. ‘Why do you pull my thread, leave it right now.’ But I’d continue pulling the threads as the owner continued shouting. Other times I caught the kites that had failed to fly and dropped on the ground.”The fallen kites got stuck in the buildings, trees or poles, or glided down in the open grounds or paddy fields. Falling kites from the Kathmandu core settled down in Tundikhel covering it. Oftentimes kites fell on the fields to rest upon the lush paddy nearing its harvest.“Children ran straight into the fields to catch the kite,” says Dibya. \"They destroyed the crops by stepping on them. Some farmers chased them, scolding along as they did so and if they caught anyone, they slapped them.”Love and restrictions on kiteAmidst the raging kite fights high up in the sky, there were apparently also some quieter kites lingering much lower among the buildings or tree lines, for their goals lay in not ruthlessly cutting the threads of other kites but piercing softly through the hearts of their owners' love interests. During the Rana regime, there were designated public spaces to fly kites, writes Gautam in his article. Referring to oral accounts, he writes that the Ranas were particularly careful to avoid kite flyers around their durbars. This is because love-stricken men tied letters to kites and flew them into the durbars to their love interests among the nanis.He writes that the kites could be flown mainly on the grounds of Chhauni. Anyone flying kites in any other place and around Rana durbars were arrested.Pant also recalls love-stricken boys from his time. “Just as kites came in different colours and patterns, so did kite flyers,” he writes in the article. “Some wrote love letters using a few words in “symbolic language” on a plain kite and attempted to land it on the rooftop of the girl they liked. Some simply landed their kites on any rooftop if a girl appeared there and waited for reaction.”King Tribhuvan among kite fliersPande writes in his book: “Once or twice during kite season every year, King Tribhuvan went to Chhauni to fly kites. Legend has it that if the line of the king’s kite was cut, it flew to Lhasa. But since anyone who caught that kite received five rupees, everyone attempted to catch that kite.”In 2021 news report ‘Bhawanle Chhekidiyo Changa Udaune Aakash’ by Shivahari Ghimire published in Nayapatrika, cultural expert the late Satyamohan Joshi also recounts that “During Dashain, Tribhuvan came to the ground below Swayambhu to fly kites. […] He did not use the same thread to fly kites twice.”In the same article, Joshi says that the King also went to Budhanilakantha to fly kites and participate in kite flying competitions.End of season, end of cultureMohan Krishna Shrestha, 86, was born in Budhanilakantha. Every year, on the day of Haribodhini Ekadashi, he saw the annual fair at the Budhanilakantha Temple. He also witnessed kite fliers gathered in the open fields around the Temple.“Oh, it’d be a lot of people,” says Shrestha. “They came from all around Bhaktapur, Kathmandu and Lalitpur.”They flew kites on Ekadashi, Dwadashi and some even until Purnima.“They took all the remaining threads and kites that had survived Dashain and flew the last kites of the season,” says Tuladhar. “I remember my uncles, relatives and neighbours going to Budhanilakantha with their kites.”Joshi recalls in the 2021 article that King Tribhuvan also went to Budhanilakantha with his sons Mahendra, Himalaya and Basundhara. He greatly supported and also participated in the competitions there organised by the commoners. If he liked he gave prize money to the winners.This annual event lost its glory days after the decline in the open fields as buildings began to rise with the establishment of Budhanilkantha School in 1972, Mohan says.“The event survived in some form until the 1990s,” he says.But what happened after that?The end-of-the-season event in the 1990s was also an indication of the end of the age-old kite tradition.“If I go to my ancestral place in Asan to fly kites, it’s not possible for me to do that today because there are buildings everywhere,” says Tuladhar. “Cityscapes and urbanisation have created the obstacle for flying kites.”Dibya does feel like flying kites sometimes.“No space to fly kites today,” he says. “In the old times, there were river banks and open fields. Even if you fly kites, it gets stuck in somebody's rooftop or water tank or somewhere.”Yesteryear’s kite enthusiasts believe that increasing means of entertainment was another reason for the decline of kite culture.“When television came, kite flying started to slowly decrease,” says Bibek. “And then mobile phones robbed kite flying even more.”And so, when his sister Sajani cranes her neck up in the sky today, she rarely sees a kite.“Those days we heard one chait after another,” she says. “These days you won’t hear a single chait.” \nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nWhat animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. \nA few years ago, the government of Nepal attempted to obtain a sovereign credit rating. In simple terms, a sovereign credit rating measures a country’s ability to repay its debts. On November 21, 2024, Nepal finally received a rating from Fitch, one of three American credit rating agencies (Standard & Poor's and Moody's). The ratings range from AAA to D, with AAA being the highest and D the lowest. Fitch assigned a rating of \"BB-\" to Nepal, placing the country among the developing economies under a speculative-grade rating similar to Bangladesh (export-driven growth economy), also referred to as \"junk status.\" This means that Nepal carries a higher risk profile for investors compared to countries with investment-grade ratings. India has a 'BBB-' investment-grade rating and widely benefits from a more diversified economy and a larger domestic market. However, Pakistan has a 'CCC+' rating because of the prolonged economic and political instability. FDI statusGiven the recent Fitch rating, it is essential to look at how Nepal’s foreign direct investment (FDI) is faring. The trend has shown some volatility in recent years. In 2019, Nepal received approximately Rs21.3 billion ($190 million); in 2020, FDI decreased by 31.76 percent to Rs15.6 billion ($130 million). As post-pandemic recovery gained traction, the FDI rebounded in 2021, increasing by 55.04 percent to Rs23.6 billion ($200 million). In 2022, inflows decreased by 66.8 percent to Rs8.1 billion ($65 million), or 0.16 percent of GDP. In the first four months of the current fiscal year (FY) 2024-25 (July 16, 2024, to November 15, 2024), Nepal received FDI commitments of Rs17.64 billion ($130.5 million) across 163 projects, where the commitments were mainly concentrated on small-scale projects, followed by medium- and large-scale projects. Sector-wise, tourism led with 66 percent, followed by services (23 percent) and manufacturing (7 percent). The actual net FDI inflow, amounting to just Rs4.81 billion by mid-October, is like the last FY, where only 13.57 percent (Rs8.40 billion) of the committed Rs61.90 billion was realised. In FY 2021, the actual net FDI inflow represented approximately 34.27 percent (Rs18.56 billion) of the committed amount (Rs54.15 billion). Additionally, the automatic route for FDI approvals in the current FY facilitated 109 projects, with total commitments of Rs1.6 billion ($12.04 million), where the majority of investments were in information and communication technology (ICT), 70 percent, followed by manufacturing and tourism (11 percent each). However, FDI in Nepal remains a critical challenge because such an investment (net flow) as a share of GDP is less than 1 percent, and there is a big gap between commitments and actual disbursement. Burdensome procedures on profit repatriation and other regulations on external transactions have historically constrained FDI inflows. At present, FDI priority sectors are energy, infrastructure and IT-based industries, but the FDI inflows are unsatisfactory given the sectors’ potential. Regulatory hurdles, land use and remittance dependence represent missed opportunities to attract enough FDI to the country.Debt statusNepal’s public debt reduced from 42.9 percent of GDP in FY 2023 to 42.7 percent in FY 2024 because of a slight reduction in the fiscal deficit. This is a positive development, as Nepal’s public debt remains lower than the median for other Fitch 'BB' rated countries, which stands at 55 percent. The public debt comprises 49 percent domestic debt, mostly Treasury Bills and development bonds, and 51 percent external concessional loans with low interest rates and extended repayment periods. Although Nepal’s debt distress rate remains low, the country’s debt servicing costs have reached record levels in FY24, exceeding capital expenditure once again.Amortisation (debt payment) accounted for 3.9 percent of GDP and interest payments at 1.44 percent, meaning repaying the loans took up 3.9 percent of the country's total economic output (GDP). Although debt is manageable, the government spent more on debt than investing in development projects. This is alarming and interconnected because high debt servicing crowds out investments in infrastructure and financial sector development. Nepal also has decent external liquidity, with foreign exchange reserves covering over nine months of imports, above the Fitch 'BB' rated country median of five months. The financial sector, which suffers from rising non-performing loans and stagnant private sector credit, restrains profitability pressure due to the provisioning of bad loans. Moreover, limited credit availability and a struggling capital market, where the government took almost 11 months to appoint the head of the Nepal Securities Board (Sebon), deter investors' confidence.ObstaclesA range of structural and systemic challenges hinder Nepal's growth. First, frequent government and administration changes (short tenures of officials) impede long-term planning and undermine investor confidence. Nepal has made progress in the energy sector, such as exporting electricity to India and Bangladesh. Despite this, there are significant challenges, such as delays in project implementation hindering industrial production. Second, Nepal's low execution of capital expenditure, where the budget is mainly spent at the end of the fiscal year, leads to inefficient allocation and poor infrastructure development. Third, weak revenue collection (around 25 percent below targets over the past 5 years) due to unrealistic forecasts and ineffective tax reforms poses fiscal challenges. Inadequate public financial management, including lack of tax reform, narrow tax base, ad hoc exemptions and poor compliance, further complicate Nepal's business environment.Moreover, Nepal has become an import- and remittance-dependent economy, contributing to private consumption. This tendency will not drive productive investments or boost domestic job creation. Structural labour market issues compounded by high youth unemployment rates (22.7 percent) further constrain growth to attract new investments. Lastly, Nepal is highly vulnerable to frequent natural disasters and an economy that will graduate from LDC status in 2026, with a low per capita GDP of $1,400, has weak governance indicators, which collectively limit the country’s ability to climb the sovereign rating ladder.Way forwardNepal must maintain the rating, which can increase or decrease depending on its performance. It also indicates that Nepal is a good destination for short-term investment, but long-term investments require more caution. The rating will help attract foreign investment in government bonds and assist banks in securing funding. However, it might lead to higher borrowing costs in international markets compared to investment-grade countries. Nepal's access to concessional financing from multilateral institutions will help offset this challenge until it graduates from LDC status.The government of Nepal introduced an automatic route under the Foreign Investment and Technology Transfer Act of 2019 to streamline pre-approvals for investments up to Rs500 million ($37.6 million) across diverse sectors. Speeding up automatic route investment will enable investors to receive pre-approval online, particularly for investments in energy production, agriculture, infrastructure, tourism, IT-based industries, services and manufacturing, with no minimum investment limit for IT-based industries. Most importantly, removing burdensome procedures on profit repatriation and other regulations on external transactions would signal increased investor confidence and efforts to attract FDI inflows in Nepal. The Fitch rating should encourage the government to create a more favourable investment climate and improve governance and institutional quality, regulatory efficiency and ease of business.   \nNepal has almost everything it needs for prosperity: A strategic location, tourism potential, hydropower and a young population. Yet, we are trapped in a vicious cycle of low growth and high migration. When the Constitution was finally promulgated two decades after the launch of the Maoist People’s War, we expected politics to be our salvation. Unfortunately, it has become our prison.Nepal's low-growth, high-migration trap isn't just an economic phenomenon—it's a political protection mechanism that preserves an unsustainable kleptocracy and crony capitalism. While the World Bank calls for a “systematic assault” on economic barriers, what Nepal needs is a paradigm shift that will fundamentally transform power relations and dismantle extractive networks.Without such a shift, emerging political agency and a growing structural crisis will create a rupture. The absence of comprehensive political and economic reforms is a matter of serious concern for Nepalis. It does not just affect our graduation to a middle-income status, which has already been pushed behind schedule; it also impacts the lives of millions of people and determines Nepal’s development trajectory.The trapSince the World Bank's initial analysis in 2017, Nepal's “low-growth, high-migration trap” has deepened. According to the World Bank, low-growth fails to generate employment. As a result, a large number of youth are forced to migrate. Migration brings in remittance, enabling consumption but no productive investment. High remittance not only creates economic distortions, but also reduces pressure on the top leaders to deliver reforms. The lack of reforms, in turn, reinforces low growth.Despite poverty reduction, Nepal has been growing at only about 4 percent, marginally better than the 2 percent growth achieved in 2023. At this rate, Nepal will be unable to graduate from LDC at least until 2030.Nepal’s economic trends and fiscal positions are becoming increasingly unsustainable, creating pressures for change. For example, budget execution rates are below 80 percent, revenue collection is dwindling, capital expenditure is low, and the debt service burden is rising.While the per capita income remains at around $1,400, limiting job creation, the manufacturing sector’s GDP share has shrunk by half since 2008. While migration is increasing, fiscal indicators are worsening. Our dependence on migration is growing. While public debt is about 44 percent of the GDP, our revenues are shrinking. Debt servicing and financial management consume almost 20 percent of the budget, while development expenditure has shrunk to 19 percent and is poorly executed.Political agencyThe kleptocracy, patronised by top political leaders, extracts power and money from the people and the state. In doing so, they misuse state power, distort its bodies and hollow out legal institutions. Despite this, political agency has failed to drive change.Institutions like the World Bank have been advocating comprehensive reforms. For example, they want to break policy barriers, build new growth sources, revitalise agriculture, address migration issues and unleash financial reforms. These reforms would make the economy more competitive, productive and broad-based. All of these recommendations directly impact the existing extractive system dominated by crony capitalism, kleptocracy and political parties. Initiating changes would mean changing the status quo, which is why these suggestions fail.The failure of new parties to put pressure on traditional parties has not helped. When the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) emerged just before the 2022 elections, it was largely driven by the aspirations of migrant workers. However, the ethical dilemma posed by evidence of corruption of RSP’s founder has dented the party’s aspirations. When the current coalition was forged, one of the objectives was to deliver results to the people to show them that there was no need for new parties. This strategy has failed. However, the new parties have met the same fate, ultimately benefiting the entrenched leaders. One of the results of this mismatch between people’s expectations and political delivery is the reluctance of people to identify themselves with a political party. Rather, the disenchantment and dissatisfaction echo in social media in fragmented ways. Activism has not worked because people have become distrustful of not only political parties but also activists who claim to represent civil society.Incremental reforms?There are enough people who believe that incremental reforms in the economy will add up and drive change. Some people are also hopeful that the traditional parties are feeling the pressure and will reform, albeit slowly. Then there are others who think we must seek alternatives to the current political system. Many of them tout China as a model of growth and aspire to have “political stability.”None of these approaches will work, unfortunately.Traditional solutions offered by donors and development partners often fail because they cannot address political-economy factors and political dynamics. These solutions focus on the symptoms rather than the root causes. Incremental reforms are often absorbed by the system, with all its deformities. And when the reforms are significant, the kleptocracy swiftly neutralises the attempts.For a few years, the traditional political parties could create the illusion of change, but all that the superficial democracy did was maintain the status quo. The current political system is rooted in extractive kleptocracy because the parties need each other to survive. Reforms will undermine the sources of political power and wealth. Therefore, political reform is impossible without disrupting the existing political power models.The current political malaise has discredited the whole democratic system. Seeking an alternative to the democratic system, however, is not an option. According to renowned economists, democracies perform at least 20 percent better than non-democracies in delivering prosperity. Democracies can also deliver more investment, economic reforms and public goods.A likely ruptureYes, the emergence of new political forces has faltered. Yet, this is only a temporary blip. At least four quarters are pressing for transformation in our political and economic system: the migrant population, urban youth, a traditionalist nationalist force allied with the former monarchy and a liberal-minded civil society. Even if political agency and social movements have failed to produce well-thought-out political movements, structural factors will continue to push for change because the status quo is untenable, and it is little prepared for shocks that may come from unexpected quarters.New structural pressures are building: Demographic transition creates new demands, digital transformation rearranges political psychology and regional economic integration forces competitiveness. Demographic pressures, economic vulnerabilities, migration impacts and urbanisation pressures will continue to generate strain until the status quo breaks.Our hope is that political agency and the structural crisis will align so that we are able to manage the transformation in a meaningful way. Otherwise, instability and chaos will become unavoidable. \nAs Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli prepares for his forthcoming China visit, the political debate in Kathmandu has reached a fever pitch. Within the Nepali Congress (NC), concerns about whether Nepal should embrace loans or grants through China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) are rising. Recently, an esteemed Indian political analyst remarked in a private discussion that BRI could deeply reshape Global South’s development aspirations. For many low- and middle-income countries constrained by limited financial resources, the initiative offers a potential pathway to realise ambitious development goals, paralleling China’s rapid growth trajectory of recent decades. Despite contributing over 30 percent of the global economic growth, China’s development model, which challenges Western norms, has yet to be entirely accepted by many developed nations.BRI’s core tenets highlight inclusive development and economic partnership, inviting participation from countries across different stages of development and socioeconomic contexts. Its six economic corridors aim to foster sustainable growth across Asia, Africa and Europe through policy coordination, infrastructure connectivity, unimpeded trade, financial integration and people-to-people connections. Guided by these principles, the initiative seeks to address pressing global challenges, including poverty, infrastructure deficits, climate change impacts, unemployment and food insecurity. The initiative extends the principles of China’s open economy, offering an advanced framework for global economic integration that emphasises mutual benefits. As the global public good, BRI prioritises the free movement of goods, services, capital, technology and people to optimise resource allocation and maximise productivity through diverse, efficient partnerships. Chinese President Xi Jinping has framed the initiative as a 21st-century vision for an open socialist economy, emphasising equitable growth, cooperation and shared progress for modern human civilisation. As President Xi articulates, BRI is a modern extension of the Silk Road spirit—a “road of peace, prosperity, openness, innovation, and shared human advancement.”For instance, Uzbekistan, a landlocked country, made the high-speed train in three years with BRI; the hydroelectric plant in Ecuador has boosted its economy; and the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed train in Indonesia ensured connectivity. Moreover, China-Laos rail and other cooperation projects being implemented in several parts of the world have resulted in substantial economic benefits to the receiving countries. The initiative has contributed to infrastructure cooperation and has had more to do with business. For instance, ASEAN countries, China’s largest trading partners, now have a trade of $975 billion, while it was only $40 billion in 2000. This was supported mainly by better connectivity after the BRI integration between China and ASEA -N member states. China’s development approach, rooted in poverty alleviation and economic resilience, offers potential lessons. Since launching its reform and opening-up policies in 1979, the country has crafted an economic model grounded in structural adjustment, strategic integration with international markets and active participation in global economic governance. Over the past three decades, this approach has achieved transformative results, lifting over 800 million people out of poverty.BRI presents a strategic opportunity for Nepal to advance development projects as there is a lack of vital infrastructure. Nepali leaders, policymakers and scholars should engage with the framework to prioritise projects that reduce trade deficits, enhance connectivity and unlock new avenues for economic growth. Under the initiative, Nepal could propose crucial infrastructure initiatives, such as developing transport corridors, AI-driven smart cities and agricultural trade routes. Strengthening trade connectivity with Tibet and neighbouring Chinese provinces could open markets for Nepali products, including cattle feed and high-value crops. Additionally, Nepal should advocate for enhancing additional border trade routes—such as Kimanthanka, Tipla-Pass, Hilsa and Dhau—to facilitate greater economic integration with China.Rather than centring discussions on loans versus grants, Nepal’s leaders should engage in substantive negotiations with China to secure strategic commitments that align with Nepal’s long-term priorities. President Xi expressed his support for Nepal’s economic development during his visit in 2019, recognising the country’s latent potential despite its slower progress relative to nations with similar socioeconomic profiles. Nepal can capitalise on China’s expertise in rapid economic growth and infrastructure expansion by approaching the BRI as a nuanced, multidimensional initiative.BRI embodies various economic principles and aspirations, including fostering equitable international relations, creating novel partnerships and ensuring mutual benefit. The key tenets of BRI, such as diplomacy, resilience-building and bridging development divides, open opportunities for Nepal to participate meaningfully in the initiative. Related initiatives, such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, Silk Road Fund and global value chain integration, offer additional partnership opportunities and resources.Nepal should comprehensively analyse the BRI framework, identifying projects that address its economic and developmental needs. Oli’s upcoming visit to China is a critical opportunity to leverage BRI's transformative potential to advance Nepal’s prosperity. Positioning strategically within this global initiative, Nepal can commence sustainable growth and enhance connectivity with the broader international community.  \nAs the world marks the 16 days of activism against gender-based violence (GBV) with the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women starting November 25, it bears recalling the different forms of violence inflicted upon women and young girls and how effective these campaigns are. According to the United Nations, one in three women globally experiences physical or sexual violence in their lifetime. The reality is dire in Nepal too. The Demographic Health Survey 2022 reveals that one in three Nepali women aged 15-49 has experienced some form of violence. Further, with the rise of technology, women have been experiencing harassment, non-consensual sexting, hate and fear in online spaces. The unresolved and harrowing rape-and-murder of Nirmala Panta is an example of the pervasive and enduring nature of GBV in Nepal.Campaigns and activism hold great promise to challenge and confront the violence women face. In Nepal, the government, non-profit organisations and international agencies join hands to discuss the issues of women and find practical solutions. Yet their actions are mostly urban-centric, with rallies and programmes not reaching the grassroots level. For countless Nepali women in rural areas who face multiple layers of marginalisation, these 16 days offer little in terms of solace or change. Words don’t translate into actions even as their issues get the centre stage. Apparently, despite having abundant legal frameworks against GBV, Nepal ranks 71 out of 190 economies in the World Bank’s Women, Business and the Law Safety indicator, which focuses on four key areas: child marriage, sexual harassment, domestic violence and femicide. The UN’s report “Femicides in 2023” states that “home is the most dangerous place for women”. Nepal is no exception, as out of 21,568 cases of violence against women reported between July 2021 and July 2022, 80 percent were related to domestic violence. And intimate partner violence—a subset of domestic violence—remains the most challenging issue to tackle. Meanwhile, with the rise of artificial intelligence, deepfakes of women have become common. Our outdated cyber laws fail to cover new threats against women and leave them ever-vulnerable in online spaces; Nepal remains far behind in addressing technology-facilitated gender violence. While this slow progress is partly due to the enduring severity of domestic and intimate partner violence, which demands significant attention and resources from the government and other stakeholders, it would be dangerous to overlook online forms of violence against women. For women going through physical and mental trauma brought about by various forms of violence, no lofty words pronounced at forums offer relief. Addressing such pervasive issues needs practical actions like making them capable enough to recognise and resist domestic violence. It is also vital to goad survivors to break silence about the abuse they face, as according to the 2022 health survey, 58 percent of women who experience physical and sexual violence don’t seek support or speak up. If they did speak up, it would be much easier for police and other authorities to intervene and help. Yet more can be done. Alongside designated days to counter violence against women, as many women’s rights activists emphasise, there should also be year-round advocacy on GBV. Sensitising men about violence against women and bringing—and enacting—stringent laws to dismantle the evolving structures that perpetuate gender-based violence are the bare minimum needed to build safe spaces for women. \nMany may find a pair of recent decisions on constitution implementation and amendment in Nepal baffling. It was nearly five months ago that the country’s two largest political parties—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—joined hands to form a coalition government, an unusual practice in a parliamentary system. They argued that the need for the constitution amendment made them forge an alliance as such a move would need a two-thirds parliamentary majority and a broad political understanding.Months after the two forces crafted a coalition government with the promise to amend the constitution, a parliamentary committee formed a sub-panel to conduct a detailed study of the laws needed for full-fledged implementation of the constitution promulgated in September 2015. The Legislation Management Committee of the National Assembly has set up a five-member subcommittee to study how many laws still need to be enacted. An earlier study conducted by a similar panel under the leadership of lawmaker Anita Devkota had found that 40 laws need amendments or replacement to align with the constitution. The earlier committee’s report, which was endorsed by the full committee in June last year, made several recommendations to the legislature and the government to update the laws in line with the constitution. But instead of doing so, the government and the parliament have either not drafted the bills or sat on several ones in the House. Now, the upper house has formed one more sub-committee.The Congress-UML coalition floated the proposal of constitution amendment while without first doing even the basics to implement the constitution. They haven’t formulated laws to allow the provincial and local authorities to use the rights enshrined in the constitution. Chief ministers of the seven provinces have been continuously pressing top leaders in Kathmandu to make necessary laws. They argue that the provinces have failed in delivery mainly in the absence of their own police and civil servants. There are several other sectors where sub-national governments have failed to perform in the absence of necessary laws as required by the constitution. This shows the hollowness of the political parties’ advocacy for constitution amendment. Really, how can a constitution’s performance be judged and amended without first fully implementing it? And, will the major political forces that didn’t even formulate laws needed for the full-fledged implementation of the statute in the past nine years suddenly start working to improve the national charter? So the problem lies in the honesty of the leaders. It’s no secret that top leaders of major parties—mainly the Congress and the UML—were not in favour of the federal system. They agreed to embrace it in the face of a wave of movement in favour of state restructuring that picked up during the eight-year-long constitution writing period. While the Congress and the UML leaders accepted federalism reluctantly, CPN (Maoist Centre) chief Pushpa Kamal Dahal has often used federalism-related issues as a political tool. It was evident in the course of naming Koshi Province. While finalising the name, he first instructed Maoist lawmakers to vote in favour of naming the province ‘Koshi’ and later he provoked ethnic communities to keep fighting for an identity-based nomenclature. In sum, at the core of the problem lies the leaders’ reluctance to devolve the centralised powers to the sub-national authorities. Such confusion and contradiction will keep cropping up until the leaders are committed to formulating necessary laws and clearing the way to allow provincial and local authorities to exercise their constitutional rights. \nThe annual United Nations climate summit, COP29, where nations discuss the future of climate, wrapped up last Sunday in Baku, Azerbaijan. Even as nations fought hard to reach a fair deal, the conference ended with a new climate finance target or New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) of at least $300 billion a year by 2035. Some representatives stood from their seats and applauded; however, delegates from developing nations felt insulted and labelled the $300 billion a “paltry sum” as it is simply not enough to address their mounting climate concerns. Even though the pledge has tripled from the previous target of $100 billion, which expires at the end of this year, it is less than the $400-$900 billion that many developing countries demanded from wealthy nations. The NCQG serves as a financial tool for justice, holding developed nations accountable for a climate crisis that disproportionately affects poorer countries. Yet, the escalating climate crisis each year has not been matched by a proportional increase in climate finance to address it. According to a 2024 OECD/IEA report, only $179 billion of the $1,265 billion tracked in global climate mitigation and adaptation finance from 2021-22 went to developing nations, with just $30 billion allocated to the least developed countries (LDCs).Developing nations like ours need this fund to adapt to climate change as they progress. Climate change impacts are not equally distributed. Nepal is one of the most climate change-vulnerable countries globally, although it contributes a negligible 0.02 percent share of global carbon emissions. This means that the climate-induced disasters the nation is grappling with, like floods, droughts, heatwaves, glacial lake outburst floods (GLOF), and so on, are outcomes of global climate change, a crisis fueled mainly by the inaction of nations with substantial carbon footprints. This is the sad reality of several South Asian nations: By 2050, Bangladesh will lose 17 percent of its territory due to rising sea levels, around 90 percent of India lies in extreme heat danger zones, and Pakistan became the 5th most vulnerable country to climate change last year according to Global Climate Risk Index. Considering our susceptibility to climate change, platforms like COP are vital to inform the world about our experiences and demand the compensation we deserve. Nepal’s COP-29 priorities this year focused on safeguarding its mountains, ensuring promised climate finance, enhancing access to climate funds, and urging the expedited implementation of the loss and damage fund established last year. Under the leadership of President Ramchandra Paudel, Nepal conducted a high-level session on climate change, during which he talked about the impacts of the melting of snow in the mountains. Nepal’s participation in the previous iterations of the UN climate summit hasn’t been that impressive. Negotiating and presenting on such platforms require experience, research and preparation. More than anything, it demands sensitivity towards climate change, which our leaders seemingly do not possess. Besides setting an NCQG, this year’s COP also delivered global standards for carbon trading and mandated all 195 Paris signatories to announce more ambitious emission targets by February 2025. However, concerns over Donald Trump’s re-election as the US president overshadowed these developments at the summit. The US, even though it is the world’s second-largest emitter after China, withdrew from the Paris Agreement during Trump’s first term. Although climate finance this year did not meet the expectations of developing nations, it cannot be rejected, especially with the rise of right-wing politicians who are indifferent to the climate crisis. Regardless, Nepal must strengthen its domestic climate change policies and enhance its negotiating and communication skills internationally. It should also collaborate with other developing nations that are experiencing the negative impacts of climate change. It is time we stopped ignoring the elephant in the room.  \nWang Peng, a research fellow from the Institute of State Governance at Huazhong University, Wuhan, was previously Deputy Secretary-General of the National Academy of Belt and Road Green Development (NABRGD) Beijing. Peng, a keen observer of South Asian geopolitics, was recently in Kathmandu to participate in ‘Kantipur Conclave-2024’. He sat down with the Post’s Purushottam Poudel and Kantipur’s Jagdishor Panday to discuss a host of issues. Excerpt:How have Nepal-China relations evolved in recent times? Generally, bilateral ties between Nepal and China have been stable. Politically, China’s Nepal policy has been stable too. Even though the administration in Nepal has changed, Kathmandu still has a stable and friendly policy towards China. Relations are progressing steadily. But we still have room for progress. Nepal’s Prime Minister is visiting China in the first week of December. This is a perfect opportunity for the Nepali and Chinese governments to enhance mutual understanding and political trust. Face-to-face meetings between the leaders of two countries are crucial. Due to the Himalayas, many Chinese people, including me, consider Nepal a country far away. But actually, we are alongside each other, not far. Nepal is an hour’s distance from Lasha and a few hours from Chengdu, which is very close. Despite being a close neighbour, China is often accused of not investing enough in Nepal, at least as compared to its other neighbours. Why is this so? There is no need to compare countries as every country has its own conditions. China’s investment in Nepal is significant, especially considering Nepal’s current economic size, population, and capability to use foreign capital effectively. We may talk about the cooperation between China and Pakistan, with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) as a flagship BRI program. China indeed has a massive investment in Pakistan. China has good relations with Pakistan for many reasons, one of them being that Pakistani politicians usually do not play the so-called “China card”. Despite political changes in Pakistan, relations between Beijing and Islamabad are seldom harmed. China is equal to every partner within the BRI framework, so the key variable essentially is the local leaders’ political choices and their ability to build consensus in domestic politics.What are you trying to suggest when you say Pakistan does not play China card? Many Chinese International Relations scholars, including me, appreciate Pakistan. What we appreciate about Pakistan is that despite their internal political differences, there is a bottom line that none of them uses China as a card. Because of this, Chinese companies dare to invest in Pakistan. This is good—good for these companies and good for the local guys—and this has created more than 10,000 jobs for the local guys over the past few years. In this way, China and Pakistan have accumulated a high level of strategic trust. Non-intervention has been the fundamental principle of Chinese foreign policy. In most developing countries, the government often changes. The country’s people can change the government if they think it has done no good to the citizens. We only hope that politicians do not use China as weapons when fighting for power. So the goal should be to devise a win-win plan to benefit both sides. You mentioned China’s investment preferences abroad. But don’t you think that the investment decisions of a democratic government and an undemocratic one like China will be different? China is a democratic country. People say that China is not a democratic country since it does not have an election. But the Chinese leaders are under intense pressure to think about history. The Chinese government and the leaders should work for the benefit of all the citizens of the country, not just for their supporters. For example, Donald Trump doesn’t need to serve all American people. Even if he supports the people who supported him during the election, his work is done. However, in China, this is not the case. The Chinese government should reconcile different peoples and encourage joint development of the country. A country like China, which is big both in terms of people and land mass, will split if the government does not tread cautiously. That’s China’s nightmare. We have suffered many tragedies in history, so we don’t want this kind of thing to happen again. The Chinese Communist Party, government and high-ranking leaders believe in history. That is why they try to create or design five-year institutions, projects, and reform plans.For example, the Chinese still celebrate Deng Xiaoping’s legacy. Despite being the leader who was not elected, did Deng use power arbitrarily? No. He prudently used his power to ensure that even 50 years down the lane, the country’s people remember him as a leader who greatly benefitted them. Other Chinese political leaders have also taken responsibility for all Chinese people and have made significant reforms to create an environment for business, and for investment in new technology, such as AI and space technology. How do you assess China’s relationship with South Asian countries in general? We should not indulge in conflict. We need resolution and reconciliation with India in the border conflict. All the neighbouring countries, including Nepal, have no border conflict. Apart from India and Bhutan, China has no border conflict with our neighbouring countries. Bhutan is happy to sign a border contract with China, but maybe they are waiting for the message from New Delhi. China will not exert any pressure. It is reasonable for China to be silent about other countries’ internal affairs. Sometimes, the decisions of neighbouring countries are not suitable for China’s interests, but China often keeps quiet and waits for good things to happen. We don’t have any land ambition in our neighbouring countries; we have enough land. If so, why is there conflict in the South China Sea? We don’t have land ambition, so we don’t want an inch of land from other countries. At the same time, we are determined not to abandon an inch of our land.If you look at the United Nations P-5 countries, which are permanent security council members, China is the most prudent country in which decisions are not made by weapons. In South Asia, China-India relations have again started to improve. It's a good beginning. China's relations with other South Asian countries, including Nepal, are stable. China and India are ancient civilisations. We have enough power to solve our problems together. We don’t need a third party’s long hand. We don’t need this kind of teaching. We are brothers; if we have problems, we can solve them together. The best way to resolve the problem between China and India is to develop mutual political trust, security resolution, and economic cooperation, which I believe will happen. Thanks to the potential threat from Donald Trump’s reelection, the two leaders of China and India have used their political wisdom to make changes in advance and create a better atmosphere for the future. Apart from security, what are China’s other concerns in Nepal?The bottom line in China’s foreign policy with neighbouring countries is peace and stability. If you read the Chinese line, we admire mutual respect. We desire friendly countries to commit to ‘One China’. Second, China would also like to promote economic cooperation with Nepal. Not only with Nepal but also with all countries. We want a simple process of import and export, a good business environment, and transparency in law and policy. If the above-mentioned things are achieved, Chinese companies will dare to increase their investment [in Nepal]. Nepal has long been an adamant supporter of ‘One China policy’. But now it has also committed to uphold ‘One China principle’? What does this shift entail for Nepal?To be precise, there is no difference. China’s bottom line is principle; for our friends, that’s policy. If they accept the One China principle, they will conduct a One China policy, which means they will not develop official contact with Taiwan. Earlier in Nepal, there used to be a discourse that Nepal could be a bridge between India and China, but you have come up with a larger perspective that Nepal could not only be a door to South Asia but also to East Asia. Can you elaborate?We don’t say Nepal or any other country should do this or that. We say we expect something. Frankly, China and India are both robust in population, land mass, and economies. Additionally, India is a young country. China also has its own advantage. Nepal has been blocked geographically by these two countries. But Nepal can potentially be the hub, not limited to the periphery. At least in the next three decades, both China and India can offer the most attractive economic opportunities in the world. If Nepal treads cautiously, it can enjoy the benefit of its location. Geography is constant, but political geography is variable and changes.If China and India go against each other, it might be a nightmare for the Nepali people. But, if China-India come together, even if not like in the 1950s, to make a rational decision not to let the border conflict escalate and promote trade, Nepal can enjoy its location as the intermediary rather than as a bridge. Rather than a bridge, Nepal should be a port. In this way, Nepal can earn a lot with China and India because both countries should get permission from Nepal to use its ports to export and import the goods they want. Bring goods from China’s Tibet Autonomous Region to Nepal and then transit to India. Bring goods from Indian cities to Nepal and transit to China via Tibet Autonomous Region. It is a very short distance, and much better. China is never envious of Nepal and India’s bilateral ties. We will never put sand in the wheels of Kathmandu-New Delhi relations. We know you are friends. But don’t make the friendship exclusive; it should be inclusive.You mentioned that China does not meddle in the internal affairs of other countries. But China has tried to bring communist parties in Nepal together and has been holding ideological discussions with these parties. Isn’t this selective engagement a form of meddling?First, one should know that in China, “international affairs” (among the governments of sovereign countries) are handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (中华人民共和国外交部) under the central government, the same as in other countries. At the same time, “inter-party affairs” (between the CPC and all other friendly parties in the world) are handled by the International Department, Central Committee of CPC (中共中央对外联络部) within the Party system.The mission of both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the International Department of the CPC Central Committee is to promote mutual understanding, friendship and cooperation between the Chinese government, the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people and governments, political parties and peoples of other countries, but the division of labor between the two is slightly different. There are some misreadings and misunderstandings.First, it said that the International Department of the CPC only communicates with communist or left-wing parties. That is wrong. In fact, the International Department speaks on behalf of the Communist Party of China and all political parties around the world that are friendly to China, including both the ruling and opposition parties.Second, it said that the International Department had contacts with opposition parties in other countries. This statement is also wrong. The International Department and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have their own priorities. The ministry and the government agencies carry out diplomatic activities and naturally deal with the ruling parties of other countries.However, the International Department of the CPC Central Committee conducts exchanges with all political parties that are friendly to China, in line with international norms and practices. Everything is above board and conducive to mutual understanding, mutual trust and win-win cooperation between the two governments, two parties and two peoples.“Non-intervention in internal affairs” (不干涉他国内政) and “foreign affairs are not defined by ideology” (不以意识形态划线) are two major principles of the CPC and the Chinese government.As Sun Yeli, spokesman for the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) said on October 15, 2022, the CPC maintains different forms of contacts with more than 600 political parties and organisations in more than 170 countries, and the international circle of friends is growing.“The more friends, the better.” As Sun Yeli said, for a long time, and on the basis of the principles of independence, complete equality, mutual respect and non-interference in each other's internal affairs, the Communist Party of China has had extensive exchanges with friendly political parties and political forces of other countries, and its international circle of friends has been growing.In recent years, China has hosted the World Political Party Leaders Summit and high-level Dialogue, attended by more than 500 leaders of political parties and organisations from over 160 countries and more than 10,000 political party representatives. The development of political party relations has driven and promoted the development of state-to-state relations and enhanced the understanding and friendship between the peoples.Sun Yeli said the CPC attaches importance to exchanges with Marxist political parties in other countries. Through theoretical exchanges and policy dialogue, they jointly explore the path of socialist development suitable for their respective national conditions and explore their respective paths to realise the localisation of Marxism.“The CPC's foreign affairs are not defined by ideology,” Sun said, adding that the CPC is willing to make friends with all kinds of political parties of all countries, irrespective of the ideology they uphold, as long as they are friendly to China and willing to conduct exchanges with the CPC.How is China seeing Nepal’s Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s Beijing visit, which will commence on December 2? Nepal’s prime minister, especially from the communist parties, often visits China. Big promises and agreements are made during the visits, but they seldom materialise. How hopeful is China about Prime Minister Oli’s visit this time?I am not a foreign ministry official. So I cannot represent the Chinese government. Over the past decade, China-Nepal relations have made remarkable progress. Political mutual trust between the two sides has steadily increased, and economic cooperation has yielded initial results. There is an old saying in China, “haste makes waste.” In other words, whether it is to develop bilateral relations or the economy through economic and trade cooperation, these things must conform to the objective economic conditions and cannot be rushed. Steady improvement and steady progress are the best. \nFormer Indian chief election commissioner SY Quraishi is a strong advocate of credible elections and inclusive democracy. He has extensively spoken and written on how increasing flow of money in elections is taking away the level playing field for candidates from different backgrounds. During his recent visit to Kathmandu, Binod Ghimire of the Post and Suresh Raj Neupane and Rajesh Mishra of Kantipur talked to him on a range of issues from electoral reforms, challenges in maintaining election sanctity in the age of generative artificial intelligence, to why the world is swinging right. Excerpts:Elections and democracy are intertwined. However, recent election results the world over are being seen as a threat to law and democracy. How do you see this phenomenon?Democracy and elections are two sides of the same coin. Without elections, there is no democracy. And worldwide, for the past 10 years, there is a swing towards the right, even in the US. In India, of course, we have been on the right for the past 10 years and our prime minister got a third term, though with a bit of reduced majority.The other thing is that in the past 10-12 years, there has been a debate on whether democracy is on a decline worldwide. The fact is that several indices of democracy indicate the decline. But people’s will cannot be taken as a threat to democracy. Sometimes they go to the left, sometimes, they move to the right. We cannot call it a threat to democracy. The democracy indices which I mentioned have a different classification.First, there are full democracies. Then there are flawed democracies. Third is hybrid democracies. The fourth is an authoritarian regime. So even in South Asia, we have one or two countries which are authoritarian, like Afghanistan and Pakistan. Their ranking keeps going up or down depending on the electoral and democratic performance. In India, the right-wing is ruling, but they lost some majority. They are now depending on two other parties, which are not considered right-wing. Of course, Trump got an absolute majority this time winning both popular vote and electoral votes. He also won both the houses. So, this is what can make him dictatorial. As it is, he is mercurial, and everybody is speculating how he is going to behave. Let’s wait and see.We can agree that people cannot be taken as a threat to democracy. But can we say that the elections, rather than complementing the spirit of democracy, are turning into tools to endorse majoritarianism?Well, people’s will is supreme. If they have chosen absolute governments, if they have given large majorities, you cannot blame the people. Many times a lot of money is being used in elections, and only the rich people get to win elections. In India, for instance, 93 percent of MPs who got elected are crorepatis [multi-millionaires]. Now, law provides for a ceiling on expenditure, so that level playing field is established, where you and I can also contest.But then, the ceiling on expenditure in India has one flaw—it is only for candidates, not political parties. This negates or neutralises the purpose of the ceiling. You can’t spend more than 1 crore, but your party can spend 20 crores on you. So where is the level playing field? Some people say there should be state funding of elections. I oppose the idea but recommend state funding of political parties. It is difficult to monitor election expenditure because of black money. Funding political parties with cheques is what I recommend because it is easy to monitor. So you think election management is more of a problem than the electoral system?Actually, both are important, because obviously the management follows what the system prescribes. There are laws, there are rules, and they have to be followed. For instance, on political funding, there is a cap on expenditure provided by law, and the election management body implements it. Therefore, we have to improve both. Both are equally important. We say public consciousness has increased with time, but there are also concerns that people are picking right-wing leaders. So what is wrong?Actually, it’s a good question but difficult to answer. Why is it that the whole world is turning right? But there are also states like Austria where everybody was thinking the extreme right was winning, but then liberals won. So, there are exceptions. Maybe people want a strong and stable government, which has the benefit of continuity. On the other hand, such a government can be accused of majoritarianism.I heard your prime minister, Oli-ji, mentioning frequent government changes. Obviously, how can the government function with this kind of instability? On the other hand there is the prime minister of India who has been elected for the third term. It is the people's choice, and you can't fault the people. The people chose stability and a strong government, and we have to respect that.Are people not knowledgeable enough to pick the right representatives for themselves?This question is often raised. For instance, we were talking about crorepatis and criminals in politics. Almost 46 percent of MPs in India have criminal cases against them. When we talk to these MPs, they say, look, people are choosing us, so how can you blame us? That way the blame is passed on to the people.Why is the electorate choosing dishonest people against whom there are criminal cases? This debate leads us nowhere. So obviously there is something good these people with criminal background must be doing in the constituency. Maybe they commit crime outside the constituency and like Robin Hood, benefit their own people.Aam Aadmi Party was a new party, and won 67 out of 70 seats in Delhi. They managed funds through crowdfunding and volunteers. And they won hands down.What are the issues that have come up with the proliferation of social media and new media?Social media and new media have revolutionised communication. But, initially, when the election commission of India in 2012 or 2013 came out with some regulation, there was a lot of public criticism, which was unjustified. Social media is also media. So whatever applies to media will apply to social media. And in the election context, what applies to the media? Two things: How much money are you spending on buying space in the newspaper and how much money are you paying to the TV channel?Therefore, how much money are you paying to Facebook or WhatsApp, you have to account for it as well. The law on expenditure will apply to social media also. The second concern was how will the election commission catch the violators, as they are anonymous. The difficulty in catching them cannot be an excuse for not taking cognisance of their offence. If we cannot catch them today, tomorrow we will. How can something be illegal in a newspaper and legal on social media?Rumours always play a big role in elections. Social media has multiplied the problem a thousand times. Within two, three minutes, your country can be burned by false, fake news. Social media however has many benefits. For instance, instead of buying space in the newspaper and TV channel, through WhatsApp or Twitter you can reach your audience in two seconds flat.So social media is a double-edged weapon, as was the consensus in the Kantipur Conclave. And, you know, it is like a knife. Is a knife good or bad? If you want to cut an apple, it is good. If you want to cut a man’s throat, it is bad. It depends how you use it. Now, artificial intelligence has given rise to even deep fakes. But AI has benefits too. Through artificial intelligence, impersonation can be stopped. Voting and logistics can be monitored. But there is so much fraud, deep fakes, and hate. So how do you catch them? That is something we have to be wary about. Frankly, I am worried because its dangers outweigh the benefits. We have to put our heads together globally to make sure artificial intelligence doesn’t overtake human intelligence for destructive ends.In Nepal, both federal and provincial elections happen at once. India too is now mulling ‘one nation, one election’. What is your take on this?There are benefits and there are problems. Logistically, it makes sense. But one MP of Odisha posed this question: ask the people. What do they want? Poor people love frequent elections because this is the only way they can highlight their importance. Otherwise, how many times have we seen that posters are put up in a constituency with headings like ‘Missing’, or ‘Wanted’ [representatives]? Frequent elections make the representatives accountable.We heard you say that if India does ‘one nation, one election’, that will be the presidential election. What do you mean?During parliamentary elections, there are national and international issues. The issues are different in Parliament [national], Vidhan Sabha [state-level] and Panchayat [local]. I would like to say that the local body elections are as important, perhaps more important because they’re closer to the people.India’s prime minister initially said that there would be a national debate and a consensus would be reached. There was a debate for 10 years, but there was no consensus.If there was no consensus, the idea should have been dropped. But the government decided unilaterally that we will go ahead and set up a committee led by the former president of India to suggest ways to implement ‘one nation, one election’. In my articles I have questioned the propriety of a former president being drawn into a government committee.They have made some questionable recommendations. They say that simultaneous will mean Vidhan Sabha and Lok Sabha, not Panchayat. But the terms of reference clearly say that simultaneous means all three tiers. Then it says Panchayat elections can be held after 100 days. After 100 days, there is a separate election. It’s a new election and will require totally different arrangements. These are also not simultaneous elections.  \nNew Zealand all-rounder James Neesham is one of the biggest stars set to feature in the inaugural Nepal Premier League (NPL) T20 cricket tournament, scheduled from November 30 to December 21 at the TU Cricket Ground in Kirtipur, on the outskirts of the Kathmandu Valley. Neesham, 34, who has represented the Kiwis in 12 Tests, 76 ODIs, and 79 T20Is, scoring over 3,000 runs across all formats, will play for the Janakpur Bolts in this debut season of the NPL. Although Neesham hasn’t played Test cricket since 2016 and last featured in an ODI during the 2023 Cricket World Cup, he continues to be a prominent figure in franchise cricket globally. His impressive resume includes stints in the Indian Premier League with teams like Delhi Daredevils, Kings XI Punjab, Kolkata Knight Riders, Mumbai Indians and Rajasthan Royals, as well as appearances in the Vitality Blast, Bangladesh Premier League, SA20 of South Africa, The Hundred, Pakistan Super League, Big Bash League, Caribbean Premier League, and Champions League T20. Currently, he is playing for Ajman Bolts in the Abu Dhabi T10 League. Binod Pandey of Kantipur Daily, a sister publication of The Kathmandu Post, talked to Neesham through email about his upcoming participation in the NPL. Excerpt:What do you hope to gain from NPL, and how do you view Nepal’s cricketing landscape?I am really looking forward to playing cricket in a new country. I’ve heard awesome things about the passion the locals have for cricket and the beautiful surroundings of Nepal. So, I am expecting great crowds and a beautiful country to boot.As a renowned big-hitting all-rounder, how do you plan to leverage your skills to make a significant impact this season?My approach will be very much the same as the other leagues I play in. I like to think I can contribute in all facets of the game and that will be my primary objective.Having played with and against some of the world’s best cricketers, how do you think that experience will contribute to the success of Janakpur Bolts?I’m sure I will be drawing on some of our local players’ knowledge of conditions and opposition, but I do hope my experience will enable me to help the team in the ever changing match scenarios you find yourselves in when it comes to T20 cricket. What motivated you to choose Janakpur Bolts?I have recently started playing with the Bolts franchise in a few other competitions and I was keen to maintain that connection with the group, particularly in light of the positive experiences I have had with them so far. You’re famous for your sense of humor on social media. How do you plan to connect with fans during your time with Janakpur Bolts?I always love spending time with the fans whenever I play. They are the bedrock of our sport and without them the game would be a very boring place. Like I said earlier, I’ve heard such great things about Nepal’s passion for the game. I hope my performances can help ignite that further.Besides cricket, what are you most excited to experience and explore in Nepal?Whenever I visit a new place I always look forward to experiencing local cultures. Nepal’s beauty is well documented so being able to experience that first hand is an exciting prospect.Do you have any plans to explore Nepal beyond cricket? Perhaps an Everest trek someday, following in the footsteps of your compatriot Adam Parore?If the opportunity arises in the future, I would certainly consider it. Although I think my main focus this trip will be on cricket!Lastly, what message would you like to share with the fans of Janakpur Bolts?⁠Get yourselves down to the ground and support the boys—we will do our very best to put on a show for you all! \nIndian Political Scientist Pratap Bhanu Mehta has served on many central government committees, including India’s National Security Advisory Board and the Prime Minister of India’s National Knowledge Commission. A distinguished academician, Mehta has taught at Harvard, Princeton and JNU. Mehta, who was recently in Kathmandu for the fourth edition of Kantipur Conclave, talked to Purushottam Poudel and Jagdishor Panday on a range of issues. Excerpt:How can we hold populist leaders accountable? Populist leaders who rise to power questioning traditional political parties and elites, seldom entertain the questions they themselves get. Let alone be accountable, the populist leaders even disagree with how they are described. If we talk about Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, you see him most of the time at election rallies. There is a joke in India that it is always in election mode. Why should they be accountable to intermediate institutions when they are accountable to the people themselves? The essence of populism is to, in a sense, say that there is nothing between them and the people. And they feel like, who are the other people to ask them questions? When they get reelected with people’s mandate, what better accountability can there be? In the age of information technology, populists speak directly to the people. Like Indian Prime Minister Modi, Donald Trump, the newly elected President of the US, had a similar approach during the US election. One short video can reach millions of people, and there are Elon Musk-like people who make sure that such a video reaches the masses.When they are directly connected to the general public, they feel like they need not be accountable to a certain group of people in society, let’s say, elite professionals. Populism is not a new phenomenon, but with the rise of social media, it seems to be gaining momentum. Can we differentiate between populism pre-social media and post-social media? We should not exaggerate the importance of social media for the rise of populism. When we look at the Bharatiya Janata Party, the major ruling party of India, the remarkable thing is how hard they work in old-fashioned campaigns; they knock on people’s doors to reach out to them. Trump did rallies after rallies before the US presidential election, so it is not necessary to buy the myth that it is the only social media that ignites populism. However, I do not want to discredit social media. The thing that is easy to do with social media is to destroy the credibility of old elites. There is an asymmetry between truth and doubt. If I want to create doubt about you, it’s easy; I can cook up something stressing that what I claim is true. And we are in a moment where most authority structures are collapsing under the weight of that doubt. That is what all populist leaders thrive on. All they need to do is create doubt about the other side. They don’t have to test whether their claims are valid. Given the velocity at which social media works, fake information disseminates easily. If someone makes a provocative clickbait tweet, by the time the other side collects accurate information for clarification, thousands of people would already have seen the tweet.Soon after the printing press was invented in Europe in the 16th century, one consequence was a total collapse of the authority of the Catholic Church. After the press, people started to interpret things in their own way. The printing press coincided with two things: a great democratisation of knowledge and, on the other hand, a total collapse of authority. Populists like the collapse of authority because that creates space for them.Therefore, I think we are in a period of trial and error. For example, there was great optimism that after the Arab Spring, social media would help democratisation. But we now realise that more than creating conditions for emancipation, it is mobilising hate in society. For me, the more critical question for democracy is the ownership of social media. Right now, social media is not only a medium. It is embedded in a structure of private ownership whose motive is profit. When your revenue depends on the number of likes you get, you will speak or write in a way that gathers you more likes. So it is a big elephant in the room of democracy, just like it was for the mainstream media many years ago. During Modi’s first term, Sushma Swaraj led the foreign ministry. In his two latest terms, S Jaishankar has been doing so. Do you find any differences in their styles, or can we term Swaraj a liberalist and Jaishankar a realist? In international relations, as a cardinal rule, you always watch what people do, not what they say. I mean, personality becomes their statement in most cases. Swaraj was a very adept and endearing politician. She knew how to talk like a politician. There was something charming about her. But I don’t think that is the key difference here. When it comes to decision-making, the Indian power structure is very centralised. Foreign policy perhaps more so. Additionally, I do not think there has been a major shift in foreign policy in the three terms of Modi. The objective remains the same: to create maximum space for India’s development. India is always in an interesting position in the region, being friends with everybody and having better relations with everyone. It is the only power that can talk to Russia, America, Iran, and Israel; this is a remarkable achievement. In the neighbourhood, I think it is a bit different. Manmohan Singh represented a generation that was convinced that the fate of the subcontinent was tied together. India is in the region; it cannot claim to be a global leader if it doesn’t do well in its own region. I think the present regime in India thinks that India can transcend its region. They might think that they are the big power, and they deal with big powers. I see that the present government has invested less in the region compared to the previous government. The second big change is cultural, which is also reflected in policy. I think 15-20 years ago, Indian politicians and civil society had more broad-spectrum relations with politicians and civil society in our neighbouring countries. When disputes arise in the region, social familiarity can help get over them. Familiar relations also allow you not to focus just on the near future and on tactical gains. But due to the centralised policymaking in India, I see less public interest in India’s neighbourhood. I see much less intelligent discussion of our neighbourhood in India now than 10 years ago. Due to which we are constantly surprised by what’s happening in our neighbourhood. Which also shows that we have less social connection. Are you suggesting Modi’s ‘neighbourhood first’ policy has been a failure? To adjudicate on success or failure, you require prior account of your objective. At one level, you could say that. But, on the other hand, in Sri Lanka, India did well while addressing the debt crisis. There was also a period of blockade in Nepal years ago. India needs to reflect: Can we actually coerce our neighbours to do things we want? That’s not what we should do. Being of considerable power means we can care deeply about our neighbour’s well-being. The axiom should be that if Nepal and Bangladesh or any of the South Asian countries do well and grow, it’s to India’s benefit. Government comes and goes, but development remains. I don’t see that kind of commitment from India. Instead, I see it as being guided by geo-strategic considerations vis-à-vis China. India should not have a veto on third-party investment in any of the neighbouring countries, including Nepal. Ultimately, if investment comes to Nepal, it will benefit India. Honestly, I feel that our neighbouring countries’ leadership doesn’t help; they often try to trade off their short-term benefit with the long-term benefits of the country; they are often found using one card against another neighbour. Good relations between countries are often built on creative work of civil society, businessmen, and other sectors. Modi travels across the world to participate in different forums; plus he is an election man. How much time can he spare for neighbouring countries? Other sectors of India are investing less in the neighbours; if you think that’s a failure of India’s foreign policy, then yes, I also would say it is a failure. When it comes to India’s relations with other South Asian countries, why is China such a big concern?I will be very honest, there are many politicians who overplay China when it comes to relations with India, and vice-versa. Former president of Sri Lanka Mahinda Rajapaksa tried to do the same. The new government of the Maldives came in so hostile to India, expelled Indian troops soon after being elected as president. However, we have completely made up with them. The Maldives also realised that it struggles without Indian tourism. The problem is that some people in our political class, intelligence services and bureaucracy try to be clever by half. When it comes to China in South Asia, to be fair to the Indian establishment, they are actually quite sophisticated in their thinking about global chess moves. India is clear what its development interests are. And it is going to engage with whoever serves those interests. As I have already mentioned, India is the only power which is engaged with every great power. I think it’s time to evolve to a detente with China after the Galwan clash. Relations are opening up again. When it comes to South Asia, it is not only about what India thinks but also what China does. When it comes to India, the biggest puzzle is that India could not fully understand China’s motives. And this is not only a problem of India but of most of the world. It is hard to read Chinese preferences.The big tragedy and frustrating thing about foreign policy discussions in South Asia is that we know our stories, we talk, we write, but we have absolutely no idea what the Chinese preferences are in the countries in the region. So my own sense in the India-China relationship is going to be driven more by what China does. If China makes a conciliatory move, India is going to respond.With Trump being re-elected the US President, how will the India-US relations fare during his second term?It seems like the Trump administration will have a pro-India team. Trump has picked Mike Waltz as the National Security Advisor. Waltz used to be the head of the Indian caucus, and Marco Rubio is Secretary of State. Both are pro-India whereas they are bulwarks against China. So if you actually look at his team, India is happy.On the other hand, he has contradictory interests. The Americans have an interest in promoting India in the global system, at least as a kind of balance against China. And I think one of the things the US has realised is that India is not going to be any ally but just a friend. There used to be a joke in the US that Pakistan is an ally, but not a friend. India is a friend, not an ally. So now they have learned to deal with India differently. Additionally, Indian Prime Minister Modi has good relations with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which is very important to the US.Despite all this, I think there is going to be friction or at least possibly friction in trade policy. For example, Elon Musk wants Starlink to come to South Asia, which is going to be tricky for India.The other area that would create friction with Trump in the Oval Office is the issue of climate, which also matters to Nepal. With Trump, there could be severe consequences, and the worst of it will hit South Asia.How do you think the twin developments of India-China rapprochement and Modi’s rapport with Trump will play out?India was actually comfortable with administrations of both the Democrats and Republicans. The Democrats sometimes lecture India a bit more, but the truth is there is a bipartisan consensus on India in the US. Given that the US is paranoid with Russia and Iran, who would have thought that India will have close relations with both these countries? So there is a bipartisan consensus.The Indian elite is now completely merged with the elites of the US. Every single ideological strand of US politics has a prominent Indian-American face. India-US relations are beyond geo-strategy. In my opinion, geo-strategy is the least interesting part. There are very few families in India’s elites who now don’t literally have family connections in the US.The governments of two countries might quarrel, geo-strategy will take its place, but the social dynamics of the relationship are much more powerful in a way which India can never have with China or even with Europe excluding the UK.However, India needs both the US and China. It needs the US for high-tech stuff. It needs China for lots of cheap intermediate imports to power its own industralisation.On the rapprochement between India-China, China reached out considering the possible Trump tariffs. China too will need some export partners.When India needs China for its industralisation why is Nepal’s economic ties with China a matter of concern for India?In South Asia, China is all in. We’re all reliant on Chinese imports, not just consumer goods, but even to power whatever industries we have. China is increasingly becoming a technological powerhouse. Nepal can be like India, it doesn’t have to choose anyone. Either India should invest in the development of Nepal or let others do so.It just has to reassure both partners that it’s not doing anything that’s going to be fundamentally detrimental to the relations with both the countries.India-China rapprochement is the best thing that can happen for Nepal.Though we feel that we know, we still fail to understand what China wants from the region. It might want assurance from Nepal that there is no anti-China activity. But, what beyond that? Honestly, no one knows.Many of the Chinese projects in the region do not make any economic sense. It seems China is using its economy to actually please the leadership of those countries. China has distorted the political systems of these countries by using its economy. If not, why would someone invest in Hambantota port in Sri Lanka knowing it is not economically viable? I think the interesting question is whether China will now take a more mature view in the relationship. It will be in South Asia’s interest if both India and China take a more mature view that clearly defines their core interests.India and China are both accused of influencing Nepal’s internal affairs. But it’s also the fact that internally Nepali forces also invite that influence. They play their factional politics using India and China. So the Nepali establishment has to be clear not to play this game.What in your opinion would most boost Nepal-India relations?Good relationships of countries depend on lots of things, along with people-to-people relations. When it comes to Nepal-India relations, there is an open border which takes our relationship to a different level and we take it for granted. Besides, business interests in both countries are something that promotes the relationship to different levels. Despite the Sino-US relations worsening, the creators of American capital urged the need of China for their economy. Same with Sino-India relations.Are you suggesting all political differences be kept at bay and Nepal-India focus on economic relationship?Nepal has to think about what is in its interest, but it has to take some intelligent strategic calls. Can Nepal get Tata, Adani and Ambani groups to invest in Nepal? I doubt it. But, if that happens, other trade stuff will automatically follow.To be honest, the political dispute between Nepal and India won’t be solved anytime soon. How can the government of both sides convince the people on the map and border issues even if they want to resolve it?The problem is that politicians of both our countries use those political disputes for domestic mobilisation. There have been politicians in Nepal who are tempted to use the anti-India card in popular politics. And there are politicians in India, a civil society structure that is very tempted to use Nepal in domestic politics. One should remember that using a foreign policy issue for domestic consumption is not something fruitful.There are media reports creating a narrative that India is unhappy with KP Sharma Oli and especially his impending China visit. Should the China visit by Nepali prime minister be a matter of concern for India?I fail to understand why India gets worried about this kind of thing. The nature of Nepal-India relations should be like they can walk in and out anytime. But it is not obvious that India is signalling that they are not happy with Nepali prime minister’s China visit.  \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli is preparing to visit China in the first week of December. It will be his first bilateral visit after assuming the office in mid-July. Nepali prime ministers generally go to New Delhi first. Sudheer Sharma, former editor-in-chief of Kantipur daily, has recently published a pair of books on Nepal-China relations—‘Himalpari ko Huri’ and ‘Bhikshu, Byapar ra Bidroha’. He also frequently writes on Nepal’s relations with its two big neighbours. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Sharma on the eve of Oli’s China visit. Prime Minister Oli is all set to visit China next month. Many find it curious that he decided to go to Beijing first before visiting New Delhi. How do you see this development?Traditionally, Nepali prime ministers have given high priority to visits and engagements with our two neighbours–India and China. This is natural. Generally, the prime ministers first visited India and then went to China. I believe Prime Minister Oli tried to do the same. We see regular engagements with New Delhi at various levels. Prime Minister Oli had met his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York in the last week of September. In August, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba visited India and met Prime Minister Modi and her counterpart S Jaishankar, among other key officials there. But Delhi has yet to extend the invitation to the prime minister. So he seems to have decided not to defer his foreign visits for long and chose to visit Beijing first. We have to see this in two perspectives. Prime Minister Oli is visiting China at the invitation of Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang and he is also going to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping. Even in the past, Oli developed good relations with Chinese leaders. So, there are expectations that he may make the visit fruitful. An equally important concern is whether this visit impacts our relations with the southern neighbour India. I think the prime minister should focus on implementing the agreements reached during his previous visits to Beijing and during Chinese leaders’ Nepal visits. He should be mindful of not irking the southern neighbour while reaching any agreement with the northern one. I believe the prime minister is conscious of this.India often seems anxious about Chinese involvement in Nepal. Do you see any risk of this visit increasing the distance between Oli and India?Maoist leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal visited China first after he became prime minister in 2008. Even in the past, some Nepali prime ministers including Tanka Prasad Acharya went to China on their first official visit. This is not unusual. The two prime ministers—Oli and Modi—recently met in New York. India doesn’t seem ready to intensify bilateral engagements with Nepal immediately. So it is natural for the prime minister to increase engagements with China, without taking any steps that could provoke India. We should stop seeking Indian signals when dealing with China, and vice versa. We should maintain parallel relations with both the neighbours without antagonising any side.In this context, what should be the prime minister’s priorities during his China visit?We have to end our chronic problem of signing agreements and not implementing them. We make announcements and forget them. There are also some infrastructure projects China pledged to develop but there is little progress. So the prime minister should draw the Chinese leadership’s attention and press them to complete the projects on time. Some important projects such as Mugling-Pokhara and Narayanghat-Butwal road upgradation by the Chinese side have been slow, causing hardships to people. Even such issues should be communicated to the political level. Also, there are several commitments made by the Chinese government but left unimplemented. This creates an impression that China makes big promises but doesn’t keep them. Prime Minister Oli often highlights the Tokha-Chhahare road upgrade project under Chinese support but there is no satisfactory progress. Progress on preparing the detailed project report (DPR) on Nepal-China cross-border railway is unclear as well. Nepal expected some substantive support from China to make the Pokhara international airport financially feasible. Some concrete steps are needed to operate this airport. There are reports that the government has requested China to convert the loan taken to develop the airport into a grant and the prime minister will push for this during his visit. It will be an achievement if the prime minister succeeds in this. In the course of writing your recent books, you extensively interacted with Chinese officials and experts, as well as with their Nepali counterparts. What are the major factors delaying the projects? Is it lack of preparation on the Nepali side or is there any problem on the Chinese side?First, we [Nepalis] sign agreements but don’t work seriously to implement them. This is true in the case of agreements with other countries as well. We are negligent. Red tape is another problem. Third, China gives less priority to small countries like Nepal as it has so many big issues with other countries. We have to constantly follow up with them to speed things up. In the past, the two sides agreed to open more border points. This should be expedited. The people-to-people relations on the border areas were historically based on social interactions at the community level. People used to trade, marry those from the other side and interact in various ways. Of late, despite progress on infrastructure development, social engagement has been hindered. This should be rectified and new border points should be opened at Dolpa, Mustang, Gorkha, Dolakha, Taplejung, and Sankhuwasabha. We should think beyond the Capital-centric approach. This will help strengthen relations at the people’s level and give alternatives in our connectivity. We should put connectivity at the core of our relations with the two neighbours. In the past decade, we have made good progress in improving connectivity with India. A study report has been prepared on the Raxaul-Kathmandu railway project. We are building an expressway linking Kathmandu and the southern belt of the country. Integrated check posts (ICPs) have come into operation along Nepal-India border points. Cross border electricity transmission lines have been built and we have increased energy trade with India. We have thus progressed in deepening connectivity with India. We lack reliable north-south highways. Therefore, the prime minister should make connectivity a major agenda of his China visit. Given the lacklustre performance of past projects, can we be optimistic about big cross-border infra projects under Chinese help?Nepal and China have committed to run some projects under the Trans-Himalayan Multi Dimensional Connectivity Network (THMDCN) concept. A key component of this concept is to upgrade connectivity between Kathmandu and Kerung that includes roads as well as a railway. The concept also envisions operating other border points. The railway project requires more study and investment and needs to consider various other factors. For now, we should prioritise opening the aforementioned border points. The Korala border point at Mustang has huge potential. Nepal is making a road that connects Mustang with the Sunauli border point with India. Centuries ago, people from Banaras used to travel to Tibet via Mustang through this route. It can be revived and made a trilateral trade route between Nepal, India and China. Similarly, Limi in Humla, Olangchugola in Taplejung, among others places, can be developed as alternative routes. As far as Kerung-Kathmandu connection is concerned, let’s first give priority to building a reliable highway. The railway project should be developed with a broader understanding between Nepal, India and China. Beijing will develop such a big project only with the big Indian markets in mind. More importantly, there are some signs of improvements in India-China relations. We have to use this as an opportunity.There are differences in the way we work and the Chinese do and there are systemic and linguistic differences as well. These factors are often blamed for lack of progress in development activities carried out with Chinese support. Can Nepalis work closely with Chinese, just like we do with Indians?Until a decade ago, several projects developed under Indian support were left in limbo. In 2015, India imposed a blockade against Nepal and that sparked anti-India sentiment. Then, India expedited several projects. This drastic change became possible as the political leadership in India realised its mistake and showed the commitment to improve things.But the same thing is not happening with China because there is a “great wall” between Nepal and China when it comes to understanding each other. The Chinese haven’t understood Nepali context. The northern neighbour should be more open and liberal in helping Nepal. Second, Nepal should also stop approaching China only when our relations with India sour. We have left this impression on the Chinese psyche. First, we should be clear about what exactly we want from China, forge consensus among major political forces and hold talks with the Chinese leaders. Then, we should be equally committed to implementing the agreements reached this way. People now take announcements of building big projects under Chinese support as propaganda. Therefore, this time the prime minister should stress on pushing the pending projects. The prime minister should tell them that even the projects announced during President Xi’s visit have not progressed and that has created a bad impression of China in Nepal.There are some differences between the coalition partners—the CPN-UML and the Nepali Congress—about the funding modality of projects under the Belt and Road Initiatives (BRI). Do you think this may cause a problem?The UML wants to expedite the BRI projects while the Congress has insisted that we should accept only grants and not loans under the BRI. The prime minister should clear such dilemmas and come up with common views before he leaves for Beijing. Once they come up with a common view on such key issues, it will give a positive and strong message. The Chinese side will take it more seriously because the strong government led by the two largest parties can implement bilateral agreements.We have instances of Nepal’s political parties standing for and against important projects funded by other countries. This was seen in the case of the US-funded Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), and China’s BRI. Moreover, in the past, the Chinese leaders created an impression that they preferred working with communist parties and leaders. This is neither in the interest of Nepal nor of China.There are also discussions on signing the BRI implementation plan during the visit. What are the things Nepal should be careful about while signing BRI-related agreements?Trying to get grants instead of loans is in itself good. But there is no need to be prejudiced against the BRI per se. Nepal reportedly wants to include some points specifying waivers in specific projects. We should be very careful while signing project-based agreements. For instance, what will be the conditions and funding modality of a project, will it be developed under grants or loans etcetera. All our technical experts and other brains should be engaged while signing project-based agreements and specifying conditions and other nitty-gritty to ensure that we will not have unnecessary liability and debt burden in the future. Over time, Nepal has rightly adopted a steadfast position saying that we don’t join a strategic alliance proposed by any country. It stayed away from the US government’s State Partnership Programme (SPP) and China’s Global Security Initiative (GSI) as well as from India’s security umbrella. But we can’t be isolated in development initiatives. We have to take support from India, China, the US and other countries based on our needs.Do you think the Chinese side will show magnanimity on Nepal’s requests, for instance on waiving off the loan to develop Pokhara international airport?Though the Chinese ambassador to Nepal last year claimed the airport project to be under the BRI, the case is different because it was signed years before we joined the BRI. And, converting that loan into a grant is not a big deal for China. They should show magnanimity given the support we have been providing to China for a long time. If you see things historically, Nepal has helped China by suppressing Khampa revolt, preventing free Tibet movements on our soil and showing a steadfast commitment to One-China policy. China, which is now prosperous, should definitely show magnanimity and waive off loan of Pokhara airport. They shouldn’t see relations with Nepal through a purely transactional lens.In your book, you describe 2008 as a watershed after which the engagements between Nepal and China increased drastically. But why couldn’t we benefit from the northern neighbour in terms of development?The Chinese side looks more interested in increasing engagement. They like to showcase their development before foreigners. But more than lavish hospitality, we need substantive support from the neighbour, which has emerged as the world’s second-largest economy. But we should be clear about what we want from our engagements with China.  The Nepali side doesn’t present its proposals clearly. On certain issues, our politicians give mixed signals. This time, if this government of two largest parties reaches a certain agreement with China and remains committed to implement it, other forces can’t hinder it. The same approach can be replicated while dealing with India, the US, Japan or other friendly countries.Is difficult geography still a barrier in developing cross-border infrastructure projects and deepening relations between Nepal and China?In our textbooks we read that the Himalayan range is a natural barrier between the two countries. In my book ‘Bhikshu Byapar ra Bidroha’, I have explored and described how people from Nepal and northern India had been traversing through these mountains and there were interactions and engagements between the people in this part of the world since the 5th and 6th centuries. So, the mountains weren’t barriers even at that time. Now technology has made things easier. We have to think about how to connect with these two big economies. We have multiple east-west highways. Now we need north-south highways connecting the three countries that will help us reap benefits from India and China.At present, relations between these two countries have improved and it is an opportunity for us. We have to forge understanding with both India and China if we have to materialise big projects based on trilateral agreement. One thing we can’t accept is the concept of two-plus-one (India, China plus Nepal). That is unacceptable because it downgrades Nepal to a junior partner. We need trilateral agreements to develop mega connectivity-related and other investment projects but such agreements should be made on an equal-footing between the three countries. \nOn Tuesday, the hilly regions of Koshi Province will experience partial cloud cover during the day, while other areas will remain mainly clear.

Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli, who reached Beijing on Monday on a four-day official visit, is set to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Li Qiang on Tuesday. Following the meetings, several project agreements and instruments are expected to be signed, officials said.Sun Weidong, vice minister for Foreign Affairs of China, Nepali Ambassador to China Krishna Prasad Oli, and Chinese Ambassador to Nepal Chen Song, among others, welcomed the Nepali delegation at Beijing Capital International Airport. Oli is leading an 87-member delegation that includes his spouse Radhika Shkaya, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba, advisors to the prime minister, members of parliament, senior government officials, and businesspersons, among others.“Prime Minister Oli will hold a meeting with Xi, the president of the People’s Republic of China tomorrow [Tuesday],” said a statement issued by the Nepali Embassy in Beijing on Monday. “On the same day, the prime minister is scheduled to hold bilateral talks with Li.”A Cabinet meeting on Sunday approved the prime minister’s visit to China, as well as projects and instruments to be signed during the visit. Besides meeting with the Chinese president and premier, Oli will hold talks with Zhao Leji, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, and will deliver a keynote address at Peking University. He will also address the Nepal-China Business Forum, jointly hosted by the Embassy of Nepal in Beijing, the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT), and the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI), on Wednesday.Sunday’s Cabinet meeting also approved the signing of a memorandum of understanding on the Volunteers’ Chinese Language Teachers’ Programme, according to Minister for Information and Communication Prithivi Subba Gurung, the government spokesman. The MoU will pave the way for Chinese teachers to teach Chinese language in various Nepali schools. Details of the programme, such as the number of Chinese teachers and working modality, will be finalised by the Ministry of Education and its Chinese counterpart, according to a foreign ministry official.China is set to provide a one-time budgetary support of $20 million to Nepal. Another agreement to accept Chinese economic and technical assistance worth 300 million RMB was also endorsed by the Cabinet on Sunday.Observers are closely watching whether the framework for cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) will be signed during this visit. A revised BRI framework document, prepared by a four-member task force from the ruling Nepali Congress and CPN-UML, has already been forwarded to the Chinese side for its consideration. Although Nepal has received positive signals on the revised BRI document, it remains uncertain whether it will be signed during Oli’s visit, a foreign ministry official told the Post before flying to Beijing on Monday.During the visit, according to government spokesperson Gurung, some project-related agreements are also expected to be signed. These include construction of an integrated check post at the Korola border point; Tokha-Chhahare tunnel road; Tokha-Chhahre-Bidur Highway; and an agreement to complete the feasibility study of 220KV Jilong/Kerung-Rasuwagadhi-Chilime cross-border power transmission line.According to Gurung, 0ther agreements include the construction of a friendship bridge in Kimathanka— Khandbari over the Arun river; construction of a multi-functional agriculture park at Chobhar; industrial park at the Korola border point; and agreement on commencing bone marrow transplant at BP Koirala Cancer Hospital. Also, a new development cooperation model for 2024–2028 between Nepal and China is also expected to be signed. During the visit, leaders and officials will engage in finalising the framework for BRI cooperation and some projects to be developed under it. The Nepali side has proposed a dozen projects to be executed under the BRI framework. Multiple officials involved in the negotiations with the Chinese told the Post that Nepal is seeking the release of pending grants announced by China since 2008 and wants to develop select projects.Similarly, an MoU will be signed between Nepal Television and China Media Group, which owns China Central Television (including China Global Television Network), China National Radio, and China Radio International.Some accords and agreements from previous visits including Araniko Highway upgrade, and the second phase of Kathmandu Ring Road expansion are likely to be signed after delegation-level talks between Oli and Li on Tuesday. Chinese assistance, including 100 electric vehicles, vans, and ambulances; and some cross-border infrastructure and connectivity-related projects, will also be discussed and signed during the prime minister’s visit, according to officials. \nAs the vote counting of the by-elections conducted to elect 41 local representatives is about to be completed, the Nepali Congress, the country’s largest party, has won the most seats. Still, the party will be far from happy. Nepali Congress candidates had, in 2022 local elections, won 29 of the 44 seats that had later gone vacant due to the deaths of the incumbents and other reasons. In the by-polls to fill these seats, the Congress is in line to win just 17 seats. The Congress won the mayor of Kirtipur Municipality, and 16 ward chairs while it had won 29 posts in earlier elections. In the recent by-elections, the Congress had already won the two posts of district coordinating committees in Kailali and Okhaldhunga unopposed as no one filed candidacy against them.Retaining the mayor of Kirtipur has come as a big relief for the party.Both the CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre), the second and third largest parties in the federal parliament, respectively, have succeeded in adding to the number of their local representatives. Of the vacant seats, each won seven in 2022. Compared to last time, while the UML added three local representatives, the Maoist Centre added two. Congress General Secretary Bishwa Prakash Sharma, who led the party’s by-poll campaign, said the results were different this time as the party contested the by-elections without any alliance. In the previous local polls, it had formed alliances with the Maoist Centre and CPN (Unified Socialist), among other fringe parties. “Although it seems that we lost some posts we had earlier won, the party members are in fact excited about the election results that we achieved with our own strength,” Sharma told the Post. The by-elections were held for one municipal mayor, two rural municipality chairpersons, four vice-chairs, one deputy mayor, and 33 ward chairs. Among these, the Congress had earlier won the post of Mayor of Kirtipur Municipality, and deputy mayor of Nalgad Municipality of Jajarkot.Likewise, it had won Gramthan Rural Municipality chairperson in Morang, Mahabu Rural Municipality chairperson in Dailekh, vice-chairperson of Gaurishankar Rural Municipality, Dolakha, and Swamikartik Khapar Rural Municipality in Bajura.Meanwhile, Maoist Centre candidates won vice-chairs in Sarkegad Rural Municipality and Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality. The Congress couldn’t retain at least 10 posts the party earlier won.The Maoists have now snatched away from the Congress Gramthan Rural Municipality in Morang and Nalgad deputy mayor in Jajarkot. Likewise, the UML has won Mahabu Rural Municipality and Swamikartik Khapar Rural Municipality.The UML has managed to retain its seven ward chairpersons but in different local units, and add a chairperson and two vice-chairpersons of rural municipalities. According to the Election Commission, UML candidate Jung Bahadur Shahi has won the post of chairman of Mahabu Rural Municipality in Dailekh.Similarly, Maoist Centre’s Namo Narayan Majhi has won the post of chairman of Gramthan Rural Municipality in Morang.Maoist Centre’s Devaka Lamichhane has been elected as deputy mayor of Nalgad Rural Municipality in Jajarkot.Likewise, Sulochana Kumari Bhandari of the UML has won the post of Vice-Chairperson of Balmiki Khapar Rural Municipality in Bajura. Her nearest rival was Pultisara Shahi of the Congress. Bhandari was earlier defeated by Maina Devi Joshi of the Nepali Congress in the 2022 local elections.The Maoist Centre did well in some places where local by-elections were held. Despite the Congress-UML alliance, the Maoist Centre won the post of vice-chair of Putha Uttarganga in Rukum (East). The Maoist Centre’s candidate Narapura Budha won the post securing 3,627 votes to defeat Kesh Kumari Tulachan of the UML who was backed by the Congress. The UML candidate Tulachan got only 2,128 votes. In the by-polls, the Nepal Majdoor Kisan Party (NMKP) candidate won the post of chairperson in ward 4 of Tilagupha Municipality in Kalikot. The party’s Khadgaraj Shahi won the post with 143 votes, defeating Naishoba Shahi of CPN (Maoist Centre), who garnered 115 votes. The post was earlier held by the Maoist Centre. Besides Bhaktapur, the party also has a presence in places like Kalikot, Humla and Dailekh. The party also has ward chairpersons in some places of Dailekh.“Our party played a big role in raising political awareness in places like Kalikot, Humla and Dailekh even during the Panchayat period,” Prem Suwal, the federal lawmaker from the party, told the Post. Among the new parties that emerged in the November 2022 elections, the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) won the post of chairperson of ward 16 of Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC).RSP’s Rojina Shrestha left the candidates of traditional parties behind. The post was earlier held by the Congress. Despite the party’s poor performance in other parts of the country where the by-polls were conducted, Shrestha’s win in KMC-16 marks the party’s debut at the local level. Shrestha secured 2,902 votes against UML’s Laxmi Ratna Tuladhar who garnered 2,220 votes. The Congress candidate Devendra Pathak managed to secure 2,214 votes in the ward.The Maoist Centre had not fielded a candidate in ward 16 of KMC. Asked why the Congress candidate lost, the party’s vice president of Kathmandu unit, Santa Kumar Maharjan, said the ward was never a Congress stronghold.“This was a ward dominated by the UML earlier as well. When all ward members were from the UML, Mukunda Risal was the only candidate to be elected from the Congress. He became the chairperson,” Maharjan said. “Risal’s victory could solely be attributed to his charismatic leadership.”Except the RSP, other new political parties failed to win any seats. The Janamat Party, which has a strong presence in Madhesh Province and currently leads the Madhesh Province government, failed to show its presence at the local level by-polls. In the by-polls held for the post of ward chairperson in seven wards in Madhesh, the Congress and the Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal led by Upendra Yadav won two posts each. The UML, the Maoist Centre and the CPN (Unified Socialist) one post each. Professor of Political Science Krishna Khanal, says that aversion to political parties played a role in this by-election. “You could say those who won in these by-elections achieved technical victories. Based on these by-polls, none of the parties can claim to have increased their internal strength,” Khanal said.  \nThough winter has already set in and the minimum temperature has dropped to seven degrees Celsius, the scourge of dengue-spreading mosquitoes continues unabated. Officials at the Ministry of Health and Population said that even though the number of infections from the deadly virus has declined, people are still contracting the disease.“Like in the previous year, we have not expected zero dengue cases in any particular month,” said Dr Gokarna Dahal, chief of the Vector Control Section at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “New cases of dengue infection are still being reported from various districts.”Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika, according to the World Health Organisation.Post-monsoon is considered a high transmission season for dengue, but Nepal has witnessed outbreaks of the deadly disease since the start of the year and in the pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons as well.Entomologists say that even if dengue spread slows naturally in the winter, the risk of infection with the deadly virus has not lessened, as the daytime maximum temperature suits virus-spreading vectors to get active.“In summer, Aedes mosquitoes bite people in the morning and evening, but in winter, they become active during the daytime when temperatures rise,” said Sishir Panta, an entomologist. “And we should not forget that even though the growth of the virus-spreading vectors slows down in winter due to cold, it does not stop.”Thirteen people have died, and over 34,000 have been infected since January 2024, according to government data. The virus has spread in all 77 districts across the country. Experts say reported dengue cases may only represent a small fraction of the true scale of the outbreak, as around 90 percent of the infected people do not show any symptoms and health authorities often underreport deaths and infections.Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms, which do not need any treatment or can be managed with paracetamol at home.As there is no specific treatment for dengue, health workers provide symptomatic care and diagnose patients based on symptoms, including platelet-rich plasma transfusion.According to experts, dengue became endemic in Nepal years ago, meaning that people get infected throughout the year.“New cases could surge once temperatures rise,” said Panta. “Also, the general public should not be complacent, as the risk has not been over. Prevention measures are essential to preventing the spread.”Experts say the disease will not stop spreading unless the lessons and experiences gained in previous outbreaks are implemented. Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects such as plastic cups and bottles could be breeding grounds for dengue-carrying mosquitoes.According to doctors, mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache and pain in the eyes are some symptoms of dengue. Doctors advise that those with these symptoms should seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and access to proper medical care can lower fatalities.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district. Since then, an increasing number of dengue infections, including major outbreaks, have been reported from many districts. The World Health Organisation (WHO) says there is no specific treatment for severe dengue, but early detection and access to proper medical care can save lives. \nNearly a year has passed, but officials say the ride-hailing service guidelines are still in the discussion phase. Government changes caused the delay.In February, the government amended the Industrial Enterprises Act 2020 recognising ride-hailing businesses as service-oriented, giving them legal status after seven years of operation in Nepal. However, 10 months later, the guidelines still remain stalled.Due to the lack of ride-hailing guidelines, a large number of service seekers are being cheated daily in terms of price and safety, and no one is listening to their grievances and complaints.“The government changed when the ride-hailing guidelines were tabled at the Cabinet for approval. Now the new government is studying and discussing the draft again,” said Balram Niraula, secretary at the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Transport, Bagmati Province.Niraula said that when the government makes changes, it requires them to start working from scratch, and the same happened with the ride-hailing guidelines.“During the previous Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government, we had tabled the draft of the guidelines in the cabinet. But the government changed and we had to start over,” he said. “Now we are updating the draft.”Another official at the Transport Ministry said the new minister needs to understand both the ride-hailing services and the guidelines that have been prepared. “It takes time.”During Tihar, many customers in the Kathmandu Valley were forced to pay exorbitantly high rates for services from InDrive and Pathao.Customers expressed anger on social media platforms and said they were charged Rs2,700 for a taxi ride from Naya Thimi of Bhaktapur to Kapan.Later, the ride-hailing companies said that the surge in fares was caused by fewer available drivers and high customer demand during the festive time.After operating unofficially for two years, the ride-hailing app inDrive was officially launched in Nepal in May. InDrive’s services are available in Kathmandu, Pokhara, and Chitwan. The company offers taxi, motorcycle, delivery, and intercity rides in Kathmandu.Frustrated with the public transport system, many people in the Kathmandu Valley rely on ride-hailing services for commuting. However, customers are not only cheated on price, their safety is also at risk due to offline rides.Ride-hailing companies said that despite a five-year old directive from the Patan High Court to regulate the sector by making laws, the government has not been able to implement any guidelines.With ride-hailing apps, riders could book, track and pay for their rides straight from their phones, and quickly navigate through clogged streets.Online app-based ride-hailing has drastically changed transportation, especially for the people in Kathmandu Valley. Ride-hailing motorbike taxi services employ thousands of people in Nepal, especially youth.Despite its growing popularity, there have been many instances of harassment. According to the government’s report, ride-hailing companies are increasing in Nepal and generating high revenues, but they are not registered and do not pay taxes.In 2017, Tootle debuted as the first ride-hailing app in Nepal. However, after two years, in January 2019, the government cracked down on ride-hailing platforms like Tootle and Pathao, but public pressure forced the government to back down, as these apps had fundamentally changed how Nepalis travelled.Subsequently, the Bagmati Province Vehicle and Transportation Management Act 2019 was implemented in February 2019 as the first legislation of Nepal to recognise the ride-sharing business through provincial law.Bagmati province declared ride-hailing services legal but issued no guidelines or policies. The Motor Vehicles and Transport Management Act 1993 states that vehicles registered for private use should not be used for public transportation.The government officially recognised ride-hailing services as a service-oriented industry in February this year under the Industrial Enterprises Act 2020. This amendment, published in the Nepal Gazette, granted ride-hailing companies legal status, affirming their place within the industrial sector. Foreign companies operate most ride-hailing apps in Nepal.The 61st annual report of the Auditor General said that despite private number plate vehicles being operated through ride-hailing platforms as public vehicles, they are not registered with the Department of Transportation Management to provide such services.The auditor general's report has highlighted issues concerning the regulation of ride-hailing services, but no action has been taken to address them so far.The draft ride-hailing guidelines propose mandatory vehicle registration. Ride-hailing drivers must register their cars and motorbikes in a manner similar to traditional taxis and operate under the regulation of the Ministry of Transport.Companies would also be required to renew their operations annually at transport management offices. The guidelines aim to regulate fares and propose mandatory insurance for passengers. \nOpener Anil Sah scored a stellar unbeaten half-century as Janakpur Bolts defeated Karnali Yaks by eight wickets to continue their winning start in the Nepal Premier League T20 cricket tournament at the TU Cricket Ground in Kirtipur on Monday.Sah powered Janakpur, who were chasing a target of 142, with a scintillating 62 off 42 balls, laced with six boundaries and three sixes, sealing the win in just 15.1 overs.A second victory in as many matches puts Janakpur, who had opened the tournament with a dominant eight-wicket victory over Biratnagar Kings on Saturday, on the summit of the eight-team standings with four points.The top four teams at the end of the single round-robin league progress into the playoffs, where the league winners and runners-up clash in the Qualifier 1 for a direct final berth, while the third and fourth placed teams battle in the Eliminator. The losing side of the Qualifier 1 vie against the winners of Eliminator in the Qualifier 2 for the second spot in the title match.Sah’s brilliance was complemented by fellow opener Aasif Sheikh, who added a brisk 36 off 29 balls.The pair, also Nepal’s national team openers, shared an 84-run stand that laid the foundation for a successful chase.Sheikh fell to Mousom Dhakal in the 9.4 overs, but the American Lahiru Milantha and New Zealand all-rounder James Neesham ensured a smooth finish.Milantha, who had scored an unbeaten half-century against Biratnagar, added 24 in his aggressive 13 ball-knock to guide Janakpur closer to target. He was trapped leg before by Zeeshan Maqsood in the 12.5 overs.Neesham, playing his first match after missing the opener, then contributed 16 not out off eight balls to take Janakpur to 142-2.Earlier, Karnali opted to bat first after winning the toss and posted 141-7 from their 20 overs.Tournament’s biggest name, former Indian star Shikhar Dhawan, failed to live up the billings as he faltered with a modest 14 off 14, bowled by Harsh Thaker.A string of early dismissals, including opener Dev Khanal (1), West Indies batter Chadwick Walton (8), and Oman’s Zeeshan Maqsood (0), left Karnali in deep trouble at 35-4 in 7.4 overs.Babar Hayat dragged Karnali to 68-5 in the 14th overs.But local hero Gulsan Jha led the recovery with 36 off 27 before Arjun Gharti and Sompal Kami added 56 runs for the seventh wicket to set a competitive target.Gharti scored 33 off 22 balls, while Kami played 29 not out off 13 balls.Chitwan Rhinos off to winning startChitwan Rhinos opened their campaign with a five-wicket victory over Kathmandu Gurkhas earlier at the same venue.Pakistani bowler Sohail Tanvir, a late replacement for the injured Marchant de Lange, was the destroyer-in-chief as his 5-21 restricted Kathmandu to 111-9.The pacer struck with his first delivery to get rid of Englishman Stephen Eskinazi for just two in the second over. Tanvir then dismantled the middle order with two more wickets in his next two overs, first cutting short the aggressive start of Netherlands opener Michael Lievitt (25 off 16) and then Bhim Sharki (1), that left Kathmandu reeling at 39-4 at the end of the power play.Sumit Maharjan added 29 off 41 and Shankar Rana played 17-ball 16 to start a brief resistance and Dan Douthwaite played 19 not out as Kathmandu limped past 100.But their total fell well below par as Tanvir returned at the death and took the wickets of Karan KC and Shahab Alam.Chitwan’s chase was also full of hurdles; they were reduced to 68-5 in 8.5 overs, with Shabhab Alam striking thrice.They lost openers Deepak Bohara (7) and Afghanistan opener Hassan Eisakhil (12) to Alam.England’s Luc Benkenstein contributed 22 off 17 before Gerhard Erasmus trapped him lbw.Kushal Malla then fell to Douthwaite for 11 before Alam dispatched Ravi Bopara.But a composed 28 not out off 31 from Santosh Karki, accompanied by Sharad Vesawkar’s 11 off 21, guided Chitwan to 114-5 in 17.1 overs. \nPolice apprehended four Indian nationals for allegedly running an illegal betting operation during the ongoing Nepal Premier League (NPL). The arrests were carried out at the Tribhuvan International Cricket Ground in Kirtipur, where the tournament has been taking place since last Saturday.The Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) identified the accused as Suman Ghosh from Kolkata, Amit Yadav from Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, and Sumanth Kumar and Brajesh Kumar from Saharsa, Bihar. They were reportedly using online betting platforms such as Sports Baji and Probo to organise gambling directly from the cricket ground.The police seized six mobile phones and four Indian Aadhaar cards from the suspects. SP Hobindra Bogati, CIB’s spokesperson, confirmed that further investigations are underway to enforce Nepal’s laws against betting. \nChitwan Rhinos secured a dominant 87-run victory over Pokhara Avengers in the second match of the ongoing Nepal Premier League at the Tribhuvan University Cricket Ground, Kirtipur, on Tuesday.Put to bat first, Chitwan set a challenging target of 162 runs, which Pokhara failed to chase, being bowled out for a mere 74 in 13.2 overs—the lowest total in this year’s tournament so far.Pokhara’s innings got off to a disastrous start, losing six wickets for just seven runs within four overs. Sohail Tanveer struck in the first over, claiming three wickets, including Pokhara captain Kushal Bhurtel for a golden duck. Rijan Dhakal followed up with another hat-trick in the fourth over, leaving the Avengers reeling.Narayan Joshi top-scored for Pokhara with a gritty 30 off 24 balls, including three fours and two sixes.For Chitwan, Tanveer, Dhakal, and Luc Benkenstein each claimed three wickets, while Deepak Bohora picked up one.Earlier, Chitwan’s batting effort was anchored by Ravi Bopara’s 51 off 38 balls, supported by captain Kushal Malla, who smashed 38 off 23 balls with four sixes. The pair’s 68-run partnership for the fourth wicket proved pivotal after Chitwan found themselves at 46-3 in the powerplay.Raymon Reifer and Bas de Leede picked up two wickets each for Pokhara, with Sagar Dhakal adding one to his tally.The win places Chitwan in a strong position in the league, following their earlier victory over Kathmandu Gurkhas by five wickets. Pokhara will look to recover quickly from this embarrassing defeat as the tournament progresses. \nUS Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs Donald Lu is arriving in Nepal.The United States Department of State in a media note said Lu will travel to India, Sri Lanka, and Nepal from December 3 to December 10.

Lokesh Bam (2) and Nicholas Kirton (5) followed cheaply, leaving the team reeling at 11-3. Rajesh Pulami (15) and Basir Ahamad (24) offered some resistance, but regular wickets kept the Kings under pressure. Abinash Bohara’s impressive spell (3-17) and Scott Kuggeleijn’s triple strike (3-30) dismantled the middle and lower order. Earlier, despite early setbacks, the Royals set a challenging target, largely due to Captain Dipendra Singh Airee’s brilliant knock of 57 not out from just 24 balls, which included three fours and five sixes.The innings began on a shaky note, with the Royals losing Amit Shrestha (1) early, caught by Martin Guptill off Ismat Alam in the second over. Binod Bhandari (23) and Brandon McMullen (36) steadied the ship, but both fell to Anil Kharel, with Bhandari caught by Pratis GC and Brandon McMullen dismissed similarly. Aarif Sheikh (9) and Saif Zaib (14) also departed quickly, as the Royals struggled at 69-4 by the 11th over.However, Airee’s aggressive stroke play turned the game in favour of the Royals. His rapid-fire innings included a flurry of boundaries and sixes, providing the necessary acceleration in the latter stages. Ishan Pandey (21) also contributed to the cause before being run out.Scott Kuggeleijn (10) and Basant Khatri (4) added brief cameos, but it was Airee who took charge, guiding the Royals to a competitive total. The Royals finished their innings at 182-7. \nNepal and China signed a total of nine deals, including memorandums of understanding and agreements, on Tuesday during Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli's official visit.According to the foreign ministry spokesperson Krishna Prasad Dhakal, the agreements and MoUs include letter of exchange on the construction of the Tokha-Chhahare tunnel, MoU on Nepal-China trade enhancement, exchange of certificate on the completion of the nine-storey Basantapur Durbar reconstruction, protocol on export of thermally processed buffalo meat, and MoU on development plan (2025-2029) between the Finance Ministry and the China International Development Cooperation Agency of China.Likewise, a memorandum of understanding on economic and technical assistance, exchange of letters on cash assistance of RMB300 million, MoU on volunteer Chinese language teachers and another MoU between Nepal Television and China Media Group (CMG) on communication technology.Prime Minister Oli was received by Chinese Premier Li Qiang at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing earlier on Tuesday.Prime Minister Oli was accorded with a guard of honour by the Chinese People’s Liberation Army. The ceremony, attended by prominent Chinese leaders, also included formal introduction of the respective delegations by the two leaders.Later today, Oli is scheduled to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping. Oli leads an 87-member delegation, which includes his spouse Radhika Shakya, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba, senior advisors, members of parliament, high-ranking government officials, and business leaders. A Cabinet meeting held on Sunday approved the visit and endorsed the projects and agreements to be signed. During his stay, Oli will meet Zhao Leji, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, and deliver a keynote speech at Peking University. He will also address the Nepal-China Business Forum on Wednesday, which is being jointly hosted by the Embassy of Nepal in Beijing, the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT), and the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI).Following the bilateral meeting between Prime Minister Oli and Chinese Premier Li Qiang today, the two countries signed the following bilateral agreements and MoUs:1. Exchange of Letter on Tokha Chahare Tunnel Road2. MOU on Nepal-China trade enhancement 3. Exchange of Certificate on the completion of the Nine-storey Basantapur Durbar reconstruction 4. Protocol on export of thermally processed buffalo meat5. MOU on development plan6. MOU on financial and technical assistance 7. Exchange of Letter on cash assistance8. MOU on Volunteer Chinese language teachers9. MOU on communication technologies between Nepal Television and China Media Group \nThe Nepal Premier League, which kicked off on Saturday, has taken the country by storm. Never before had a national-level tournament created such buzz among domestic and international audiences. Nepali cricket fanbase, who grew up watching the Indian Premier League, are now ecstatic to have their own truly international franchise league comprising no less than eight teams. The fact that people from different parts of the country are travelling to the Tribhuvan University Cricket Ground to cheer on their favourite teams speaks volumes about the tournament’s mass appeal.The ‘Festival of Himalayas’ features big cricketing names like former Indian opener Shikhar Dhawan, New Zealand all-rounder James Neesham, Dutch Michael Levitt, Namibia’s Gerhard Erasmus, and Australia’s Ben Cutting. Nepali cricketers—both national players and newcomers—will now get to rub shoulders with these global cricket superstars, which will greatly boost their confidence. The NPL will also hopefully offer these players enough financial incentives to pursue cricket as a profession. In fact, the recent all-format international success of the Indian national team is often attributed to the IPL, for some of the same reasons. The start of the NPL this year could thus mark a sea-change in Nepal’s success in international cricket. The league will have a global audience after getting the Star Sports Network, an internationally established TV network, as the official broadcaster; and after partnering with the Twenty-first Century Media Sports, a company that has managed many international events. They will help showcase Nepal as a global cricket destination. No wonder Nepali cricket fans are upbeat. As one fan placard during Saturday’s opening match between Janakpur Bolts and Biratnagar Kings put it: “No matter who wins it is the victory of Nepali cricket.”Done well, the NPL’s success will resonate much beyond the international sports scene. The vast majority of Nepali youths are looking to leave the country the first opportunity they get. They see no hope in their country. But when they see that cricketers and commentators and organisers from around the world are coming to their homeland to play as professionals, perhaps this feeling of disenchantment with their native country will go down a bit. Additionally, if Nepal can successfully pull off an international tournament like the NPL, there is no reason this welcoming country cannot host tournaments like the cricket Asia Cup. But there will also be challenges. The Cricket Association of Nepal has taken up the monumental task of organising an eight-team tournament. The association’s history of managing similar tournaments is checkered. For instance, the CAN-organised Nepal T20 League in 2022-23 was marred by controversies even before it kicked off due to allegations about match-fixing. The body has also faced criticisms for negligence, delayed payments and incompetence. Even in the opening match of the NPL on Saturday, the association failed to manage the crowd, which in turn led to injuries. The next day, fans were seen running on to the cricket pitch at the completion of a match. In order to maintain the integrity of Nepali cricket, it is vital to minimise such incidents. Hopefully, the CAN is learning with every match. The CAN must get the NPL right, for the tournament’s benefits are potentially limitless. The millions of international TV viewers of the NPL will get to see what a beautiful country Nepal is and this in turn could boost the country’s tourism prospects. The NPL itself, linked to a multitude of stakeholders, can create many profitable jobs, especially as other stadiums are built and the tournament expands to other parts of Nepal. Exciting times, indeed.  \nThe November 27 review meeting of the government’s performance in the first quarter of the current fiscal year (2024-25) was reportedly a big disappointment to the ministers and secretaries. Prime Minister KP Sharam Oli lambasted the dismal performance of key ministries and was irked by the worrisome economic indicators.Nepali economy reels under unpalatable paradoxical indicators. On the upside, the current account surplus is Rs112 billion, whereas the balance of payment is also in surplus of Rs185 billion. Further, the remittance inflow is impressive, with more than 10 percent growth. The foreign currency reserve is the highest in Nepal's history, touching $16.6 billion. The loanable liquidity available in the banking system has crossed Rs700 billion. Similarly, the non-performing assets in banks and financial institutions have gone up to 4.5 percent of disbursement. In its first quarterly review published last week, the Nepal Rastra Bank has chosen not to change its main monetary policy stance.During the first four months of the current fiscal year, till mid-November, merchandise exports were only Rs46 billion against the import of Rs513.4 billion. Capital expenditure remains pathetic at less than 11 percent of the capital allocation of Rs357 billion while it should have crossed at least 35 percent on average. Similarly, revenue collection is short of its quarterly target by about 15 percent. However, public debt is expanding exponentially, crossing 45 percent of the national gross domestic product (GDP) at Rs5.7 trillion. Development partners have not released any grants so far during the last four months of the fiscal year, and public financial management has thus become increasingly challenging.An agonising question here is: Despite some strong fiscal and monetary fundamentals as indicated above, why has the economic administration of the state failed to utilise them and waded through a widespread loss of confidence among investors, consumers and players in the market? Apparently, the reason for economic underperformance and pessimism is not only the inadequacy of financial resources but also the lack of failure in the overall economic management of the government on both fiscal and non-fiscal fronts. Economic managementEconomic management covers the quality of three closely related policy areas: Fiscal and monetary policies and sovereign debt. It is almost everything about an economy’s operation and governance.Despite shrinking revenue and alarmingly ebbing financial assistance from its development partners, managing a smooth stream of financial resources has been the greatest challenge to Nepal's fiscal policy or budget balance. Over the decades, subsequent governments have failed to consolidate their tax base and tax net, and undermined the importance of exploring new sources of capital to flow into the economy. Overdependence on import-based revenue is antithetical to the very idea of making the economy self-sustainable. The cause of concern is that the sovereign has barely demonstrated the management skills required to bridge the development financing gap, which is becoming herculean with time.Nepal Government’s official review report states that “to achieve the targets of the 2030 Agenda (Sustainable Development Goals and Paris Agreement 2030), a total investment of $163 billion is required for 2024-30, i.e. more than $23 billion per year”. This is an impossible task given that Nepal's total national budget in actual is barely $10 billion. Unless the government demonstrates its creative resource management ability, our dream of development and prosperity will not even be partially realised.The second glaring challenge is the lack of capacity for resource absorption at the government’s executing units, from federal ministries to ward offices in municipalities. Not only has the capital budget allocation come to 18 percent of the total budget outlay, but only about 60 percent of it is spent. This is purely a question of management efficiency at all levels: Project prioritisation, project implementation and project management at the ground level.Third, the biggest hurdle for the provincial and local levels is the lack of skilled human resources with economic understanding and management skills. Finding and maintaining human resources with thematic and sectoral competence, even at the provincial level, for planning, prioritisation, public procurement, plan implementation, expenditure effectiveness and expenditure monitoring is proving daunting. The situation is far more dire at the municipality level. Due to the lack of efficient economic management in all three tiers of the government, the necessity to review formulas of equalisation, grant allocation, revenue and other financial resource sharing does not seem to be the priority of the dispensation. After almost a decade of fiscal federalism, it is now imperative to have an evidence-based approach to review the institutional and operational efficacy of the gamut of public financial management under the federal polity.Emerging challengesEvidently, Nepal's conventional economic management paradigm faces challenges stemming from the vicious cycle of low resource availability and efficiency and low level of economic output (growth). A peek into the future brings about a new set of challenges to the fore. Among dozens of issues, three problems warrant immediate policy attention.One, Nepal's political and bureaucratic decision-making process has summarily failed to take the state’s federal architecture into due cognisance. Such evasion, omission and ad-hocism are more pronounced in economic and financial matters.Two, a critical departure is inevitable to manage the trade-off between Nepal's acute infrastructural social development needs and the obligation to make all these sustainable and environment-friendly. The unequivocal necessity to reduce the risk of climate change-induced disasters and prepare for post-disaster rescue, relief and rehabilitation compels us to source additional financial resources and their effective mobilisation.Finally, like any other developing country, Nepal's prospects of catching up to become a digitally advanced and knowledge-centric nation are contingent on its ability to invest in these capital-intensive endeavours. To bridge the growing digital divide across regions, ethnicities, economic classes and genders, effective economic management would entail not only finding the financial means but also involving a substantial social capital for judicious outcomes from every drop of the nation's investment. \nOnce, human rights were understood as the simple principle that one person’s rights should never extend beyond the tip of another’s nose unless invited. On December 10 each year, the world comes together to observe International Human Rights Day, a day that underscores the inherent dignity and the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family. First recognised in 1950 under the guidance of the United Nations, this day has evolved into a global call to action for the protection and promotion of human rights worldwide. Yet, despite decades of progress, violations persist across the globe, reminding us that the fight for human rights is far from over. The debate on human rights dates back centuries, and two of the most prominent figures in this discourse Edmund Burke and Thomas Paine left a lasting legacy that continues to resonate today.Burke, a supporter of the monarchy, saw the preservation of tradition and hierarchy as essential to societal stability, while Paine, a revolutionary thinker, championed liberty, equality, and the rights of individuals. One of Paine’s most famous lines, “We pity the plumage, but forget the dying bird,” directly addressed the hypocrisy of focusing on superficial issues while ignoring the deeper, more urgent concerns. In modern times, these words still carry weight, highlighting how we often address surface-level concerns while systemic injustices persist, unnoticed or unchallenged. The observance of Human Rights Day invites us to reflect on the progress made and the work still to be done. It is a reminder that the principles outlined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 10 December 1948, remain crucial in shaping a more just and equitable world.However, despite the ground-breaking achievements of the UDHR, widespread violations continue, and the fight for human dignity remains on-going. Throughout history, the struggle for human rights has been a journey fraught with obstacles. One notable turning point in this struggle occurred in the United States during the 19th century. The abolition of slavery, a monumental achievement, came about through the tireless efforts of leaders like Abraham Lincoln, who, in 1863, led the nation to abolish the institution through the 13th Amendment to the Constitution. This was a transformative moment in the history of human rights. Despite the victory, however, African-Americans continued to face systemic discrimination and segregation for many years after.The 1954 landmark decision in Brown v. Board of Education, where the US Supreme Court declared racial segregation in public schools unconstitutional, was another significant victory for human rights in America. But even after this, African-Americans had to fight for basic rights like access to education, the vote, and an end to discriminatory laws. It was only in 1965, after decades of struggle and advocacy by civil rights leaders like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., that African-Americans were granted the right to vote under the Voting Rights Act. These achievements were monumental, but they were hard-won, demonstrating the lengths to which marginalised communities had to go in order to claim their human rights. Internationally, the story of human rights has also been one of continuous struggle and progress.The United Nations’ adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 was a defining moment. It set out, for the first time, a global standard for human rights, affirming the rights of individuals to life, liberty, and security, among other freedoms. The UDHR became the foundation upon which many countries would base their own human rights frameworks. But the road to realising these rights in full has not been easy. Over the decades, the UDHR has been supplemented by two essential covenants—the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights—passed in 1966 to reinforce and clarify the rights outlined in the UDHR.One of the key figures behind the development of the UDHR was Eleanor Roosevelt, who, as the chairperson of the UN Human Rights Commission, played a pivotal role in its creation. Known as the “mother of modern human rights,” Roosevelt’s vision for a world where all people were treated equally and with dignity shaped the discourse on human rights for generations. Unfortunately, she did not live to see the full impact of the UDHR, passing away in 1962, but her legacy lives on. Since 1998, the Eleanor Roosevelt Award for Human Rights has been awarded annually to individuals who have made significant contributions to the protection of human rights. As we reflect on the history of human rights, we must also acknowledge the many challenges that remain today.In the United States, for example, despite significant progress, debates about gun control and mass shootings continue to spark deep divisions. The United Nations and various human rights organisations have called for greater restrictions on firearms, but powerful interest groups like the National Rifle Association (NRA) continue to push back against any form of regulation. The on-going violence in schools and public places is a stark reminder that the struggle for human rights continues, and that the protection of human life and safety is an essential component of human rights. In India, human rights protections are enshrined in the Constitution, which guarantees the right to life, liberty, and equality. However, even in a country with such a strong legal framework, violations of human rights are not uncommon.Discrimination based on caste, religion, gender, and disability continues to affect millions of people across the country. While the Constitution guarantees equal rights for all, the reality often falls short. The National Human Rights Commission, which works to address these issues, plays an important role, but there is still much work to be done. The issue of discrimination remains one of the most pervasive challenges to human rights. Genderbased violence, including domestic abuse, sexual assault, and trafficking, continues to devastate the lives of women and girls around the world. In many countries, LGBTQ+ individuals face violence, discrimination, and the denial of basic rights.Refugees and migrants, fleeing war, persecution, and poverty, are often subjected to inhumane conditions and denied their rights to safety and protection. The most vulnerable members of society, including those who are stateless, face some of the most extreme forms of discrimination, and the international community must do more to protect them. On a global scale, poverty and inequality are also significant barriers to realising human rights. Despite progress in some areas, the gap between the rich and the poor continues to widen. Economic inequalities, along with the challenges posed by climate change, pose major threats to the realisation of human rights for millions of people around the world. The struggle for human rights is far from over.While progress has been made, there are still millions of people around the world who are denied their basic rights and dignity. The world must come together to address the root causes of discrimination, inequality, and violence. Human rights are not just abstract concepts; they are the foundation of a just and peaceful world. As we observe International Human Rights Day later this month, we must renew our commitment to these principles and work to ensure that they are upheld for all people, everywhere.The fight for human rights is not just the responsibility of governments or international organisations. It is a responsibility shared by all of us, whether through advocacy, education, or simply standing up for justice. We must remember the words of Eleanor Roosevelt, “Where, after all, do universal human rights begin? In small places, close to home.” It is in our homes, our communities, and our everyday actions that the future of human rights will be determined.—The Statesman (India)/ANN \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli heads to China today amid a heated debate on the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). At the centre of the debate is an argument over whether Nepal should accept only grants to develop bilateral Nepal-China projects or such projects can also be built with loans. In the end, the two main ruling parties—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—decided that there would be no loan deals during Oli’s China trip. The Congress had been adamant that Nepal cannot afford any more loans and as such there was no question of adding a financial burden to the country. As things stand, 12 projects are lined up for signing. An agreement on the ‘BRI framework for cooperation’ is also likely, which, at least in theory, should add momentum to old and new bilateral projects. There are multiple readings of the two ruling parties’ disagreements on negotiating with the Chinese. In one, the Congress, as the biggest ruling party, played a dubious role by unnecessarily tying the prime minister’s hands before an important visit.Oli, in this reading, won’t have much to show at the end of the trip. Yet there can be an alternate and more charitable reading of the recent sequence of events—and one which will be more salubrious to the country’s interests. The BRI became so controversial on the eve of Oli’s China trip precisely because there was lack of clarity on what being a part of it entailed for Nepal. When the country signed up to the initiative’s framework agreement back in 2017, there was little debate even as grey areas galore. For instance, the document Nepal signed seven years ago is yet to be made public, fanning many speculations. In this context, the new debate on the kind of cooperation the country can expect under the BRI was much needed. Unlike in the past when they were querulous opponents, this time, as coalition partners, the Congress and the UML were forced to come to an understanding on the initiative. They did this through a four-member taskforce that carefully dissected the new China-proposed framework. The Nepali side has tweaked the new BRI framework document in line with the suggestions of the taskforce and sent it back to China for final approval. Nepal has long felt the need for a broad political understanding on vital foreign policy issues. Yet such an understanding has invariably been made a victim to top leaders’ never-ending jockeying for power. This time, the differences between the Congress and the UML over the BRI, and the wider debate it sparked, have helped the country arrive at a more nuanced position on how to engage with China, one of Nepal’s two most important foreign friends. The deals Prime Minister Oli locks up in Beijing matter. But, more importantly, the decision of the country’s two biggest political forces to devise a common platform on a vital foreign policy issue bodes well for Nepal. If and when Oli goes to India, perhaps the two parties can come up with a similar common position. And the same while dealing with other important foreign actors. The sum of these understandings can in turn form a solid basis for a more consensus based Nepali foreign policy. Perhaps this extrapolation is a little simplistic. But the goal of greater consensus looks more achievable today than it did even a week ago.  \nQatar’s ambassador to Nepal Mishal bin Mohammed Ali Al Ansari paid a courtesy call to Vice President Ram Sahaya Prasad Yadav at the Vice President’s office in Lainchaur on Tuesday. The meeting was focused on bilateral relations, employment, trade, and the exchange of visits, according to the Vice President's Office.During the discussion, Vice President Yadav requested the Qatari government to ensure round-the-clock insurance for Nepali workers, facilitate the rescue and compensation of Nepalis who have died or been injured in Qatar, and provide necessary assistance to Nepalis in hospitals, deportation centres, and prisons.“There are currently 67 Nepalis serving prison sentences in Qatar, and many others are living undocumented,” said Vice President Yadav. “Iurge Qatar government to take initiations to grant amnesty, reduce prison terms, and assist undocumented Nepalis in obtaining regular employment or returning to Nepal.”The Vice President expressed satisfaction with the collaboration between Nepal and Qatar in regional and multilateral forums on issues of mutual interest. He also appreciated Qatar’s mediation efforts in securing the release of Nepali citizen Bipin Joshi and other hostages.Ambassador Ansari emphasised the importance of strengthening Nepal-Qatar relations and expressed Qatar’s commitment to promoting and protecting investments in Nepal. “There are currently 400,000 Nepali workers in Qatar, and we are working to bring domestic workers from Nepal as well,” he said. \nUkraine on Tuesday blasted an agreement struck 30 years ago under which it relinquished nuclear weapons in exchange for security assurances that never materialised, as it makes a concerted push for an invitation to join the NATO alliance.Kyiv is desperately calling for robust security guarantees to protect it from renewed Russian aggression as US President-elect Donald Trump’s return to the White House raises fears of a rapidly-struck settlement to the war that would leave it exposed.Ukraine’s foreign ministry pointed to the 1994 Budapest Memorandum which saw Kyiv give up the world’s third-largest nuclear arsenal in return for security assurances, including from Russia, after the 1991 Soviet breakup.“Today, the Budapest Memorandum is a monument to short-sightedness in strategic security decision-making,” the ministry wrote in a statement, marking this week’s anniversary of the December 5, 1994, agreement.It said the agreement “should serve as a reminder to the current leaders of the Euro-Atlantic community that building a European security architecture at the expense of Ukraine’s interests, rather than taking them into consideration is destined to failure.”Ukraine has denounced the memorandum since 2014, long before the 2022 invasion, when Russian troops seized and annexed Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula before backing paramilitary proxies in the east.That’s enough to supply around a dozen enterprises, the company said.The fighting in Ukraine’s east, which killed thousands, was brought to an uneasy ceasefire followed by dozens of rounds of talks under what was known as the Minsk agreements.Even after almost three years of all-out war, Kyiv has balked at the prospect of a return to similar negotiations that could see a temporary ceasefire but leave open the prospect of a new Russian invasion.“Enough of the Budapest Memorandum. Enough of the Minsk Agreements. Twice is enough, we cannot fall into the same trap a third time. We simply have no right to do so,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said.Kyiv wants NATO members to issue an invitation at a meeting of the alliance’s foreign ministers that starts on Tuesday, as the invasion grinds toward its three-year mark and Russia makes battlefield gains.The foreign ministry statement called on the United States and Britain, also signatories to the 1994 memorandum, as well as France and China, which it said also acceded to it, to support the provision of security guarantees to Ukraine.“We are convinced that the only real guarantee of security for Ukraine, as well as a deterrent to further Russian aggression against Ukraine and other states, is Ukraine’s full membership in NATO,\" it said.Russia sees the idea of Ukraine’s integration into NATO as anathema and says it is an unacceptable security threat. \nChina will ban exports to the US of items related to gallium, germanium, antimony and superhard materials that have potential military applications, its commerce ministry said on Tuesday, a day after Washington’s latest crackdown on China’s chip sector.Beijing’s directive on so-called dual-use items, which cites safeguarding national security and interests and takes immediate effect, also requires stricter review of end-usage for graphite items shipped to the United States.“In principle, the export of gallium, germanium, antimony, and superhard materials to the United States shall not be permitted,” the ministry said.The curbs strengthen enforcement of existing limits on exports of the critical minerals that Beijing began rolling out last year but apply only to the US in the latest escalation of trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies ahead of President-elect Donald Trump taking office.However, there have been no Chinese shipments of wrought and unwrought germanium or gallium to the US this year through October, even though it was the fourth and fifth-largest market for the minerals, respectively, a year earlier, Chinese customs data show.Gallium and germanium are used in semiconductors, while germanium is also used in infrared technology, fibre optic cables and solar cells.Similarly, China’s overall October shipments of antimony products plunged by 97% from September after Beijing’s move to limit its exports took effect. China accounted last year for 48% of globally mined antimony, which is used in ammunition, infrared missiles, nuclear weapons and night vision goggles, as well as in batteries and photovoltaic equipment.China’s announcement comes after the United States launched its third crackdown in three years on China’s semiconductor industry on Monday, curbing exports to 140 companies, including chip equipment maker Naura Technology Group. \nIndian foreign ministry says action taken to step up security for all Bangladesh missions across IndiaIndia today said the security breach of the premises at the Bangladesh Assistant High Commission in Agartala, the capital city of the northeastern state of Agartala is “deeply regrettable”.The Indian Ministry of External Affairs, in a statement, also said it is taking steps to step up security in diplomatic missions of Bangladesh across the country.“Diplomatic and consular properties should not be targeted under any circumstances,” the MEA said in a statement amidst rising tensions in bilateral ties.The comments by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) came hours after thousands of people took out a massive rally around the Bangladeshi mission in Tripura protesting the arrest of Hindu monk Chinmoy Krishna Das and alleged attacks on minorities in Bangladesh.According to PTI, over 50 protesters reportedly entered the premises of the Bangladesh mission in Agartala, triggering concerns among those present at the complex.The rally was taken out under the banner of Hindu Sangharsh Samity, an affiliate of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP).A memorandum was submitted to the Assistant High Commissioner of Bangladesh in Agartala, Arif Mohammad, over the issue, PTI said.“The incident earlier today of the breach of premises at the Bangladesh Assistant High Commission in Agartala is deeply regrettable,” the MEA said in a statement.It said the Indian government is taking action to step up security for the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi and other missions of the country in India.“The government is taking action to step up security arrangements for the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi and their deputy/assistant high commissions in the country,” it said.Last Friday, MEA spokesman Randhir Jaiswal said that the interim government in Bangladesh must live up to its responsibility of protecting all minorities as it expressed serious concern over the “surge” of extremist rhetoric and increasing incidents of violence against Hindus.Relations between India and Bangladesh have come under strain after the interim government headed by Professor Muhammad Yunus came to power following the ouster of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on August 5.-In Association with ANN \nCocoa farmer Joseph Arkoh’s vote in Saturday’s election in Ghana hinges on one unlikely issue: fertiliser.“All of us farmers are suffering,” the 56-year-old said, as labourers harvested bright yellow pods on his land deep in the bush. “When we meet, the fertiliser and chemicals are big concerns.”Following the pandemic, a painful cost-of-living crisis and a sovereign debt default, Ghana’s economy is again growing. But the cocoa sector in the world’s number 2 producer is in the throes of a crisis.In an expected close contest between the ruling New Patriotic Party’s (NPP) Mahamudu Bawumia, the current vice-president, and former president John Dramani Mahama of the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC) party, the votes of cocoa farmers could be decisive. And many of them are angry.“The NPP, they’re not for farmers. They’re for business,” said one farmer in a ruling party stronghold, who asked not to be named. “I am voting NDC.”Previously, he supported NPP.Cocoa farming households, estimated to constitute around 2 million voters, are a heavily courted voter bloc in a country with a total electorate of more than 18 million.As the cocoa sector’s problems help to alienate farmers from the government, at least one voter survey has tipped Mahama to win, although detailed polling data is not available in Ghana.“Should the trend in favour of the NPP be reversed due to any disaffection over cocoa, this will reinforce a pattern analysts are observing in the upcoming elections: the NPP losing most of the swing vote,” said Bright Simons, of the Accra-based IMANI thinktank.‘JUST BEGGING’ FOR PRICE RISESOn the campaign trail, both leading candidates are after the cocoa vote.“We have helped cocoa farmers. Cocoa farming has become good. We’ve raised cocoa price,” Bawumia told growers during a campaign stop last week.His campaign declined a Reuters request for an interview.Ghana’s cocoa production peaked in 2021, with output of over 1 million metric tons of beans. But it has been in rapid decline ever since, hitting its lowest level in decades last season.Analysts say climate change and tree disease are responsible, while many farmers also blame the government for failing to clamp down on wildcat gold mining that has destroyed large parts of the cocoa heartland.The government-set price for farmers has increased under NPP, but Ghana’s cedi currency is depreciating as global markets for the chocolate ingredient are at historic highs.That has left farmer incomes lagging global price trends and fuelled smuggling.“The government should be sympathetic,” said 34-year-old farmer Abubakar Jebril. “We are just begging that they raise the price.”MONEY FOR MANAGEMENT, CUTS FOR FARMERSMuch of the farmers’ ire is reserved for Cocobod, the state regulator that manages the cocoa sector.Cocobod did not immediately respond to a Reuters’ request for comment.Even as production has shrunk, Cocobod’s spending has ballooned. Its accounts showed administrative costs more than tripled between 2018 and 2023, sparking accusations of waste and corruption.A 2023 government audit of a programme to rehabilitate roads used to transport cocoa to warehouses and ports found that just 13% of contracts were awarded through competitive bidding.Cocobod awarded contracts worth 18.2 billion cedis ($1.2 billion), or more than six times the programme’s budget.At the same time, it rolled back free fertiliser distributions for farmers.“They’re pushing all the money to themselves on cars and other things and reduced spending on the farmers,” Mahama said last week while campaigning in Takoradi, an important cocoa-growing region.Mahama has promised to distribute free fertiliser, improve Cocobod’s management, cut administrative costs, and combat illegal mining and smuggling.Bawumia has been less specific but Cocobod, at the International Monetary Fund’s behest, has proposed a turnaround plan to reduce costs and increase farmers’ share of cocoa revenues.Industry players remain sceptical about either candidate's pledges to reverse the sector’s decline.On his farm, Arokoh, who voted for the ruling party in the last election, still hopes that Bawumia and the NPP will address his main concern. But so far he has been disappointed.“If they give me fertiliser, I will vote for them,” he said. “If not, then I will change and vote for NDC.” \nChief of Army Staff (CoAS) General Ashok Raj Sigdel will leave for a four-day visit to India on December 11 at the invitation of Indian Army Chief General Upendra Dwivedi. During the visit, General Sigdel will be conferred with the honorary rank of General of the Indian Army, a longstanding tradition between the two countries. Sources from the Ministry of Defence confirmed the trip to the Post. Earlier, on November 20, General Dwivedi visited Nepal for five days, during which President Ramchandra Paudel conferred him with the honorary rank of General of the Nepal Army in a ceremony at the President’s Office. General Dwivedi visited key locations during his stay and met President Paudel, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, and CoAS Sigdel. The Indian Army remains a major military donor to Nepal. \nA recent UNESCO report revealed that two-thirds of social media content creators do not verify whether the information they post is accurate.Furthermore, 73 percent of surveyed creators expressed a desire for training on fact-checking.The report, “Behind the Screens: Insight From Content Creators”, published on November 26, surveyed 500 online content creators from 45 countries and territories through an online poll. Additionally, 20 creators were interviewed in-depth to understand their practices and challenges.The findings show that they struggle to evaluate the credibility of the information they encounter online before sharing it. About 42 percent of respondents admitted they rely on the number of likes and shares a piece of content receives to determine its accuracy.The survey also highlighted that 59 percent of creators are unfamiliar with legal frameworks and international digital regulations. Just over half said they were aware of training programmes on this topic, but only 13.9 percent expressed an interest in attending such sessions.A lack of knowledge about fact-checking processes leaves some content creators vulnerable to legal uncertainties, potentially leading to sanctions or prosecution in some countries.Of the respondents, 26 percent said they create content to share knowledge, 23.8 percent to earn income, and 23.4 percent for entertainment purposes.Most of the shared content was based on personal experiences (58.1 percent), personal research (38.7 percent), and news sources (36 percent). Topics primarily revolved around lifestyle, beauty, travel, food and gaming. Instagram (34 percent), Facebook (25 percent), TikTok (16.4 percent), and YouTube (9 percent) were the most commonly used platforms.Audrey Azoulay, UNESCO director-general, noted that digital content creators have acquired an important place in the information ecosystem, engaging millions of people with cultural, social or political news.“But many are struggling in the face of disinformation and online hate speech and calling for more training. As part of its mandate for media and information literacy, UNESCO will support them through the first-ever global training course,” she added.Azoulay added that UNESCO is committed to supporting those who seek training on verifying information before publishing it.UNESCO’s first global fact-checking training programme was launched this month, with 9,000 participants from 160 countries.-In Association with ANN \nSudurpaschim Royals posted a formidable target of 183-run against Biratnagar Kings in the ongoing Nepal Premier League match at Tribhuvan University International Cricket Ground, Kirtipur, on Tuesday.Despite early setbacks, the Royals set a challenging target, largely due to Captain Dipendra Singh Airee’s brilliant knock of 57 not out from just 24 balls, which included three fours and five sixes.The innings began on a shaky note, with the Royals losing Amit Shrestha (1) early, caught by Martin Guptill off Ismat Alam in the second over. Binod Bhandari (23) and Brandon McMullen (36) steadied the ship, but both fell to Anil Kharel, with Bhandari caught by Pratis GC and Brandon McMullen dismissed similarly. Aarif Sheikh (9) and Saif Zaib (14) also departed quickly, as the Royals struggled at 69-4 by the 11th over.However, Airee’s aggressive stroke play turned the game in favour of the Royals. His rapid-fire innings included a flurry of boundaries and sixes, providing the necessary acceleration in the latter stages. Ishan Pandey (21) also contributed to the cause before being run out.Scott Kuggeleijn (10) and Basant Khatri (4) added brief cameos, but it was Airee who took charge, guiding the Royals to a competitive total. The Royals finished their innings at 182-7. \nDuring monsoon last year, the Chandannath Municipality of Jumla district reported several cases of dengue. The local unit has reported cases of infection from the deadly virus this year too.Although most cases were locally transmitted, health workers in the district don’t consider the virus spread a serious public health problem. This is because Jumla is among the coldest places in the country, with temperatures dipping to subzero levels in the winter.Studies, however, show a disturbing development.“My study shows the presence of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes and their larvae in Chandannath Municipality,” said Buddhi Ram Oli, a PhD scholar at the Central Department of Zoology of the Tribhuvan University. “Chandannath Municipality is located at an elevation of 2,438 metres, and this is the first time that dengue virus-spreading mosquitoes and their larvae have been found at such a high altitude.”Earlier, vectors spreading the deadly disease were recorded only up to 2,100 metres.Local residents and health officials serving in Jumla are aware of the presence of vectors spreading deadly diseases and growing number of infections. But they don’t take the issue seriously, thinking that the vectors cannot survive long due to the climatic conditions of the region.“We once met officials at District Health Office Jumla and discussed launching an awareness drive and destroying breeding sites of mosquitoes,” said Chhatra Bahadur Mahat, health coordinator at the Chandannath Municipality. “But neither does the health office provide a budget for such programmes nor does the local unit allocate any funds. So we couldn’t do anything.”Along with Jumla, all districts across the country have recorded dengue infections this year.Oli, who carried out vector surveillance, said that, as in Chandannath Municipality, health workers at other local units too have not taken the risk of the virus-spread seriously.Experts say the country’s health workers and health facilities are ill prepared to cope with the emerging public health challenges brought about by climate change. Several health facilities were overwhelmed with dengue patients this year, too. Due to a lack of beds, patients were forced to sleep in corridors, on the floor, on chairs, in storerooms, and out in the hospital compound. Hospitals even lacked basic supplies like IV stands, and patients’ visitors had to hold the IV bags or health workers had to improvise by tying them to windows.Experts say the deadly virus outbreak in most mountain districts and all hill districts shows the impact of climate change on Nepal’s healthcare system. Despite these challenges, no effective mitigation measures have been adopted.Many hospitals are overwhelmed with an influx of patients, and health workers are forced to place seriously ill patients in corridors and other makeshift spaces, compromising patient safety.“Our health facilities are not equipped to endure the climate crisis,” said Dr Meghnath Dhimal, chief researcher at the Nepal Health Research Council. “Many are built on hilltops or riverbanks and are vulnerable to climate impacts. These health facilities are also unprepared for emerging problems and surges in patient flow.”Experts say climate change, along with some other factors, such as increased mobility and improved transportation, has been contributing to the spread of deadly diseases in places considered no-risk zones in the past.“The rise in the temperature caused by climate change provides a conducive environment for dengue vectors to thrive and spread in the mountainous areas,” said Dhimal. “Risks posed by climatic factors cannot be ignored or underestimated.”A report by the United Nations titled ‘Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability’ states that at least six major vector-borne diseases have recently emerged in Nepal and are now considered endemic, with climate change implicated as the primary driver.The report also showed increasing evidence that climate change has extended the elevational distribution of Anopheles, Culex and Aedes mosquitoes, which carry viruses to above 2,000 metres in Nepal.Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. According to the World Health Organisation, the same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and the Zika virus.So far, 12 people have died due to dengue and over 29,000 have been infected since the start of 2024 if the government data is to be believed. Experts say reported dengue cases may only represent a small fraction of the true scale of the outbreak, as around 90 percent of the infected people do not show any symptoms and health authorities often conceal the actual number of deaths and infections.This year, districts in Tarai region reported fewer cases of dengue infection than districts in the hills and mountains. Experts attribute this to the residents of Tarai’s becoming more aware of the deadly virus and taking preventive measures. High temperatures (above 35 degrees Celsius) could also have contributed to less infection, as mosquito vectors do not survive above 35 degrees Celsius.Over the past few years, dengue has become a year-round threat in Nepal, with cases consistently on the rise. \nManufacturers and exporters say they are in a dilemma over trade with India following the restrictive measures imposed by New Delhi on Nepali goods. Making matters worse is the Nepali government’s silence even though the goods have not been sold to India for months.Dol Raj Adhikari, president of the Nepal Sanitary and Diaper Association, said sanitary pads and diapers worth of Rs250 million had been stranded in the warehouses for the past three months.“We completed all the processes to acquire the Bureau of Indian Standards [BIS] certificate to export our products, but no team from India is coming to inspect the factory. We even wrote to the Indian authority multiple times but our requests have fallen on deaf ears.”As per the provision, once the Indian inspection team gives a green signal after factory inspection, goods can be exported to India.In 2020, the Indian government asked the BIS to prescribe mandatory standards for imported goods in line with international quality norms. The move aimed to prevent Chinese goods from entering India from any of its neighbours.After the suppression of Chinese apps, the Indian government imposed import restrictions on more than 370 Chinese products. Insiders say India does not want any products from Nepal that have Chinese components, including Nepal’s hydroelectricity, greatly worrying Nepal’s top exporters.The BIS deals with the marking and certifying of goods, incorporating quality standards and information on international norms to be followed while importing.The rules worry Adhikari, who owns the AG Health Industries Private Limited that produces sanitary pads and diapers in Bhairahawa. “India seems intent to halt imports from Nepal,” said Adhikari. According to the association, Nepal used to export three truckloads of sanitary pads and diapers daily. There are 29 sanitary pads and diaper factories in Nepal, both large and small, employing 6,000 workers.Sanitary pads and diaper factories used to operate 12 hours a day when the demand boomed, but due to the export obstacles, factories have reduced operating hours by 4 hours, said Adhikari.According to the Department of Customs, Nepal exported 201.99 million pieces of sanitary pads and diapers worth Rs719 million to India in the last fiscal year, ending mid-July.Likewise, a big consignment of Goldstar shoes failed to get export clearance after India refused to issue the BIS certificate, putting Nepal’s homegrown shoemaker on the brink.Exporters said there were rumours on Friday that India had extended the deadline to obtain a BIS certificate, and the Nepali exporters were allowed to export goods with their existing certificates.“But we have not received any formal notice from the Indian authority on the time extension of the BIS certificate,” said Baburam Adhikari, spokesperson for the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies. “If the BIS had made such a decision, we would have been informed.”“Neither the BIS India nor the domestic industries has confirmed or communicated with us on the issue.”After Nepali exports were halted over the BIS issue, the industry ministry has written multiple times to its Indian counterpart. Meetings were held, and the issue was forwarded even during Industry Minister Damodar Bhandari’s visit to India in August. “However, there is no progress,” said Adhikari. Adhikari said none of the Nepali exporters who applied for the BIS certificate have gotten it till now.“The BIS certificate issue has put the industries in Rupandehi in a big dilemma. They were opened to export goods to India,” said Thakur Kumar Shrestha, president of the Siddhartha Chamber of Commerce and Industry. It has negatively impacted both the industries and Nepal’s trade.Shrestha said factories are either running at half capacity or getting shut down, and workers are being laid off. Exports from the cement makers in Rupandehi—such as Arghakhanchi Cement, Sarbottam Cement, Palpa Cement, and Balaji Cement—have completely stopped for nearly two months.“Even as the domestic consumption of cement declined, production was not impacted due to the huge demand from India. But now cement plants in Rupandehi are on the verge of shutting down or running under-capacity,” said Shrestha.Except plywood, the export of all the listed goods that require a BIS certificate has come to a halt, said Shrestha. “India has neither renewed the certificate nor provided a new one.”Goods under the BIS with compulsory certification are any variety of cement manufactured or sold in India, steel and iron products, chemicals, fertiliser, polymers and textiles, cables, flat transparent sheet glass, cattle feed, footwear, centrifugally cast (spun) iron pipes, jute bags, viscose staple fibres, geo textiles, portable water bottles, plywood, and wooden flush door shutters, among others.“Plywood is currently not restricted. But despite having already paid the BIS charges and completed the process, the inspection team from India has not provided a BIS certificate for Nepali goods,” said Hom Prasad Ghimire, president of the Nepal Plywood Manufacturers Association. Ghimire said that his company completed the process of getting the BIS certificate in June. He said the Nepali plywood is of better quality than the Indian plywood.Plywood has been given until March 2025 for certification-free export. He said that out of 80 plywood factories, 52 have even deposited charges to obtain the certificate. The plywood industry employs 25,000 workers across the country.According to the association, Nepal exported Rs8 billion worth of plywood to India. The volume could have increased had the exports not been interrupted.Trade with India has been repeatedly obstructed. Experts say there is a need to seek long-term solutions for uninterrupted trade with the southern neighbour. “There must be a mutual recognition agreement on select exportable items. Under such an agreement, exportable goods certified by the government will be recognised by the Indian government. This would be the best long-term solution for standard certification,” said Posh Raj Pandey, chairman of the South Asia Watch of Economics, Environment and Trade.Under the 2009 bilateral trade agreement with Nepal, India agreed to support the setting up of standard-purpose labs, said Pandey. However, Nepal has not been able to push for the labs during talks with India— even after 15 years of the agreement. He said lack of coordination among government agencies and frequent changes of bureaucrats have put the issue on the back burner. \nThe US has just concluded our generation's most eagerly watched presidential elections. Donald J Trump has won the White House resoundingly, and in addition, the Republican Party, also known as the Grand Old Party, has now wrested control of the Senate and has a comfortable majority in Congress. Simply put, Trump and the GOP now have complete control of the executive and legislative branches of the government, which will embolden the new Trump administration to pursue policies with determination. The world is closely watching how the Trump administration will usher in a new foreign policy paradigm that revolves around Trump’s “America First” philosophy. Foreign policy mandarins across the globe have mixed feelings about Trump's victory: Allies in Europe are gripped with anxiety, whereas in South Asia, there is a sense that since the rhetoric of Trump’s election campaign focused on combating China, Asia is on the cusp of witnessing unprecedented American engagement. It is in this context of American outreach in Asia that South Asia will play a pivotal role in shaping outcomes of a constantly evolving new world order. Nepal must remain steadfast in keeping up with developments of the great power games whilst constantly safeguarding and pursuing its interests independently. The heart of the US’s contention with China revolves around two critical issues: Trade and technology. The Covid-19 pandemic demonstrated to the world how global trade supply chains depended on supply lines in China. With the resurgence of the America First policy, the Trump administration is determined to impose new trade tariffs of up to 60 percent on Chinese exports. While the supposed new tariffs are likely to come into play in the second half of 2025, there is palpable fear that new trade tariffs could bring in disruptions to global trade as costs are likely to increase in the coming days. The Trump administration is determined to create new jobs to revitalise the economy by incentivising manufacturing in the country. Whilst Trump's plan to re-establish the US as a manufacturing hub is seen as a patriotic move, could higher labour costs in a developed country contribute towards lower production costs? The US’s trade conflict with China presents other developing nations in Asia with a unique opportunity to attract investments in the manufacturing industry. Although it is outlandish to suggest China will be entirely substituted as a manufacturing hub, the emergence of new manufacturing opportunities in the global south presents the US with the opportunity to fuel economic growth essential for the sustenance of democracy. South Asia gives the US a unique avenue for enhanced collaboration. With a democratic polity spread across most of South Asia’s landmass, job creation and energy production are the key elements for stability in the region. The Indo-Gangetic delta is among the most populous regions in the world and possesses the human capital to fuel economic growth across South Asia. Although the Civilian Nuclear Deal between India and the US is a milestone agreement for the use of clean nuclear energy to generate electricity in India, the nuclear plants in India only contribute 3.11 percent of the total electricity generated in India. For India to meet the energy requirements to set up a large-scale industrial base, access to high-quality uninterrupted energy will be critical for industrialisation in India and across South Asia. The Millennium Challenge Corporation pact signed between Nepal and the US is a significant breakthrough in Nepal’s energy sector, as American investment in upgrading transmission line infrastructure is greatly required to transport high-quality, uninterrupted energy.Nepal still requires robust investment in the transmission side to feed supply lines across South Asia. The fact that Nepal, Bangladesh and India have signed a power trade agreement demonstrates the potential of Nepal’s energy sector in fuelling energy to propel economic growth in the region. South Asia missed the industrial flight back in the decades of the 80s and the 90s; it’s time the region reaped the benefits of the US capital that could trigger a wave of industrialisation. Another focal point of tension between the US and China is the issue of semiconductors. The US would want to retain the technological leadership of high-end chips in the hands of its allies, namely Taiwan, South Korea and the Netherlands. Currently, the world relies solely on Taiwan and its crown jewel, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC), for high-end chips—TSMC has a market share of 90 percent of advanced chip manufacturing. Both the US and China know the strategic advantage one can gain by accessing high-end chips, which is critical for next-generation AI modelling in sectors such as defence, intelligence, telecom, medicine and aerospace. The ability to store big data also depends on the quality and the advanced functioning of high-end chips. In simple words, the US’s ability to retain control and contain access to high-end chips to compete whilst diversifying the production of low-end chips will provide the US and its allies the political leverage it desperately wants. The tech industry in South Asia has been recognised as a force to reckon with, particularly in India and the periphery of Bangladesh. Sri Lanka seems to have made progress, while Nepal also aspires to expand its tech business reach. Cross-border payments, the expansion of data centres and the use of technology in the delivery of governance are areas of expansive collaboration. India’s ability to produce low-end chips in the future is also critical to expanding the tech industry in South Asia, as indigenously produced chips can help reduce manufacturing costs and the tech industry’s dependency on accessing chips elsewhere, which are always in high demand globally. But there are also areas of concern for South Asia regarding Trump’s ascendency to the White House. Trump has vowed to pull out of the Paris Climate Agreement and climate change is an issue that confronts South Asia, particularly Nepal. Nepal has witnessed firsthand the impacts of climate change and, therefore, the country and South Asia at large cannot afford to ignore the impact of climate change. This issue cannot become secondary for either Nepal or the region. Climate change challenges the livelihoods of our people, and the Government of Nepal must voice its concern visibly and work towards creating strategic alliances that will compel the new US administration to rethink walking away from Paris Climate Agreement. The new US administration and its South Asian partners must work on issues impacting human welfare to achieve wider social and economic participation in the democratic process in the region. Trump’s vision of America First is virtuous, but to restore the US’s trust globally, he must take its allies into confidence.  \nHow big will the impact be as Nepal’s major international airport closes for ten hours starting Friday?Economists say it’s too early to quantify, but the losses for the Nepali economy will be huge.Nepal’s economic momentum has slowed down since the late September floods, and the government’s decision to close the key airport could stifle growth.“It will be a big setback for the country’s ailing economy as it will hit tourism and business activities, including transport, hotels, restaurants, telecommunication and other sectors,” said Bishwambhar Pyakurel, a noted economist. Pyakurel called it a deliberate “restriction” imposed by the government, despite it having many alternatives to carry out construction at the airport.Tickets prices are soaring, with most destinations, including Nepal’s labour markets, witnessing a fourfold price rise due to a widening gap between supply and demand.A notice to airmen, popularly known as NOTAM, issued by the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, states that the airport will be closed from 10pm to 8am from Friday for five months, until March 31, to expand the taxiways. The airport is currently closed from 2am to 6am. Two parallel taxiway projects are ongoing at the Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu. The extension of the parallel taxiway was initially planned in 2009.Travel trade entrepreneurs said the civil aviation body’s mismanagement could shave off at least Rs50 billion in airline and tourism industry revenues, even as the government struggles with revenue generation.The outlooks for 2024-2025 of the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the International Monetary Fund forecast economic recovery on the basis of improved tourist arrivals in Nepal. Growth in food, transport, and accommodation sectors have been better than expected even as other economic indicators lag.In September, the Asian Development Bank revised Nepal’s economic growth forecast upward to 4.9 percent for the current fiscal year beginning mid-July, based on projected agricultural and electricity output growth and buoyant tourist arrivals.The National Statistics Office’s annual account estimated that accommodation and food service activities, which are linked to tourism, would see a robust growth of 21.84 percent, the highest among 18 economic compositions in the Nepali economy, in the last fiscal year ended mid-July.According to the respective ministries, the late monsoon floods and landslides affected agriculture and electricity output, and now tourism has received a big jolt.It will be more painful for domestic airlines as winter will bring more fog and pollution, curtailing flight frequencies.“It’s an unplanned construction,” said Pyakurel. “Today, time is money. For trading, business and leisure, coming to Nepal will be a big challenge,” he said, adding that the airfares are so high that tourists and businessmen will think twice before flying. Hoteliers say that due to high ticket prices, key events planned in Kathmandu have either been postponed or cancelled.As part of the improvement plan, a 1,140-metre-long parallel taxiway is being built on the runway’s southern side, or the Koteshwar end. This will connect the existing international apron to the end of runway 02.Similarly, another 450-metre-long parallel taxiway is being built at the northern end of the runway.Considering the planned infrastructure, the maximum runway capacity will see 42 aircraft movements per hour in mixed-mode operation, enabling 187,000 aircraft movements per year from the 128,449 flight movements last year. In 2023, the Kathmandu airport recorded 8.7 million passengers—4.54 million international air travellers and 4.15 million domestic ones, according to statistics of the Tribhuvan International Airport.Similarly, in terms of flight movement, the airport handled 128,449 flight movements—31,460 flights by international airlines and 96,989 by domestic carriers.Travel trade entrepreneurs say the ill-planned construction would take way too long, extending until another peak tourism season in spring (March).“These will be painful months for travel trade entrepreneurs as the plan is being implemented in the peak tourism season. We, however, cannot oppose the airport’s infrastructure development,” said Sagar Pandey, president of the Trekking Agencies Association of Nepal.“On different occasions, we have suggested that the government and the civil aviation body find alternatives to such a long closure, such as incentivising airlines to fly from Bhairahawa and Pokhara international airports.”However, international airlines are hesitant to connect to the new airports, which have remained idle for months due to the technical and financial issues of flying to them.Pandey said they might lose at least 40 percent of trekkers this year considering the flight cancellations.Nepal Tourism Board has revised its 2024 tourist arrival forecast to 1.1 million from the projected 1.3 million. As of October, Nepal has received 900,000 tourists.Some entrepreneurs say that five hours of construction time, as it used to be, was appropriate, but insiders suspect that a 10-hour closure would force many airlines to divert to Bhairahawa. For instance, on October 27, the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) took action against a Thai AirAsia flight, refusing to allow it to land at Kathmandu airport.Media reports show that the flight was later permitted. However, after the plane landed, authorities temporarily suspended the airline and its general sales agent. Later the restrictions were lifted on the “condition” that the airline would fly from Bhairahawa as well. Airline officials say the “punitive measure” was not the aviation regulator’s first action. On October 30, 2022, the CAAN cancelled Nepal Airlines’ scheduled flight to Delhi as punishment for defying instructions to move some of its international services to the newly-built Bhairahawa airport.Nepal Airlines’ jet remained on the ground, and more than 500 passengers were affected by the last-minute cancellation.“I would like to seriously draw the attention of the government that Tribhuvan International Airport is being closed for 10 hours daily from November 8 to March 31. It cannot be considered normal to close an international airport for 10 hours to build structures. Earlier, during the rehabilitation of the main runway, the airport was closed only for 5/7 hours at night,” lawmaker Udaya Shumsher Rana wrote on X on October 29.“It is clear that closing the Kathmandu airport means diverting flights to Pokhara and Bhairahawa to show that those two airports are fine. There are technical reasons behind international airlines not being ready to fly to these two airports. Undoubtedly, the Civil Aviation Authority leadership is trying to hide its weaknesses by closing the Kathmandu airport for 10 hours.”Rana argued that if this decision is not revised, Nepal’s global image and tourism business would suffer. The airport closure will also hit domestic flights. Buddha Air, Nepal’s largest domestic carrier, currently operates 180 daily flights. As the airline must reduce its flights to 135, there will be a substantial drop in its revenue and government’s taxes. Some other domestic airlines have complained to the regulator that flight allocation is not proportionate under the new arrangement. \n\n\nRae was the envoy to Kathmandu during the promulgation of the 2015 constitution and the subsequent blockade. In this conversation, Rae talks about the evolution of Nepal-India ties since the blockade, regional geopolitics, what the two countries get wrong about each other, how New Delhi views Nepali communist parties and the governments they lead, and the change (if any) in India’s neighbourhood policy since the start of Narendra Modi’s third term in office. \nKunwar has been the MD for just under three years. Before coming back to her homeland to join Daraz Nepal, she worked at different American companies, including Amazon, the world’s biggest e-commerce platform. In this conversation, Kunwar talks about the opportunities and challenges of running an e-commerce enterprise in Nepal, as well as the country’s overall business environment.  \nMorning walkers are often captivated by the wall of Janakpur Cigarette Factory Limited (JCFL). Despite its worn-out condition—with faded colours, peeling plaster, exposed bricks, and overgrown bushes—the wall stands out with its vibrant Mithila paintings. JCFL has been closed since July 1, 2019, and now serves as the headquarters of the Madhesh provincial government.Women are busy painting the walls, holding brushes and acrylic colours. Seated on the footpath, artist Ramita Thakur worked on a painting depicting the marriage of Ram and Sita. Alongside the artwork of the divine couple sitting on a throne, she sketched a bow to complement the scene.“Once the sketch is complete, we will add colour. It may look black and white now, but it will be stunning after it’s coloured,” says Thakur, who began painting two days ago and estimates it will take her another two days to finish.The construction of JCFL began in Janakpur in 1960 with assistance from the Soviet Union (Russia). The 64-year-old JCFL wall is currently adorned with Mithila paintings by the Madhesh provincial government. Three artists were finalising a painting on the western wall of the main gate of the Chief Minister and Council of Ministers’ office. These artists, who depicted the traditional Mithila wedding on the wall, used colours that matched their own clothing.A total of 160 Mithila paintings will be painted on 3,500 feet (1 km) of the outer wall of JCFL, which occupies 33 bigha and 9 kattha land. “All 160 paintings will be unique,” says Udit Kumar Thakur, the information officer at the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure Development under the Madhesh government. Around 50 artists have been commissioned to create the Mithila paintings. The Ministry is investing Rs2 million in constructing the outer complex of JCFL.Thakur, the information officer at the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure Development, stated that 160 Mithila paintings showcasing Mithila’s culture, lifestyle, cuisine, and diversity will be created on the wall. “The outer wall of the Madhesh government headquarters used to look unattractive,” Thakur explains. “The Mithila paintings have been added to enhance its appearance. All the artists who paint the wall are local artists from Janakpur.” Artist SC Suman began by creating Mithila paintings on mud walls. “In those days, natural colours were used for the paintings,” Suman shares. “Later, the shift to cement walls brought an increased use of acrylic colours.” He explains that while the tradition of painting on walls remains rooted in history, the medium has evolved. “Previously, the artwork primarily depicted mythological themes. Now, it also addresses contemporary issues.” \nThe Nepal Election Commission is holding local level by-elections for 41 vacant positions on Sunday. In the fray are 377 candidates, including independents, according to the commission.The by-polls are set to be held in local units across the seven provinces. The voting began at 7am and will continue till 5pm.Three of the total 44 vacant posts were elected unopposed. Now, one municipal mayor, one deputy mayor, two rural municipality chairpersons, four vice-chairpersons, and 33 ward chairpersons are up for grabs.The district coordination committee candidates in Kailali and Okhaldhunga were elected unopposed from the Nepali Congress. While Tek Raj Bhattarai in Kailali and Tika Kumari Chaudhary in Okhaldhunga of the Congress were unchallenged, CPN (Maoist Centre) candidate Jagat Gharti had no contenders for the Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality ward-2 chairperson post, according to election officials.The commission is conducting voting from 7 am to 5 pm on Sunday at the polling stations set up at respective local units where the seats have gone vacant.Nita Pokharel Aryal, spokesperson for the Election Commission, said that all preparations for the by-polls have been completed.“Special arrangements have been made to give priority to disabled, senior citizens, pregnant women and other people requiring different arrangements to cast their votes,” Aryal said. According to Aryal, those whose names are included in the final voter list can cast their votes showing the original proof of voter identity card, Nepali citizenship certificate, national identity card, passport, driving licence or permanent account number card.Commission officials expect higher voter turnout compared to earlier elections. According to an officer at the commission, the election body analysed some lapses in the past elections and fixed them. “We believe the turnout will be higher this time,” says an official.Counting of votes will begin immediately after the voting is completed, and all the ballot boxes will be collected at the designated counting centres. The commission has said that the count can be followed on its website.The commission plans to announce the final by-election results within two days.“We expect to use a helicopter to collect ballot boxes of Gaurishankar Rural Municipality of Dolakha due to the difficult geography of the village,” Durga Prasad Chalise, the deputy spokesperson for the commission said.“It may take some time to collect ballot boxes in Sarkegad Rural Municipality of Humla and Swamikartik Khapar Rural Municipality of Bajura, but other than that, we will have no problem starting vote counting immediately.”The commission is holding by-elections as per the legal provision. According to the Local Level Election Act-2017, if the position of the district coordination committee chief, deputy chief, rural municipality chairman, vice-chairman, municipality mayor, deputy mayor and ward chair fall vacant for any reason before the end of their term and if more than a year of their term remains, the remaining term will be filled through a by-election.The elections are being held only to elect 41 representatives at local units but political parties have given priority to the by-polls as if it is going to be a test of their strength.Even top politicians such as CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, Nepali Congress general secretaries Gagan Thapa and Bishwa Prakash Sharma and CPN-UML General Secretary Shankar Pokharel, among other influential leaders, were actively involved in election campaigns in favour of their candidates.Some reckon people could express their disenchantment towards traditional parties because of their inability to deliver on governance. But Uddhab Pyakurel, an assistant professor at the Kathmandu University, said the by-elections can’t be seen as a voice of the Nepali people at large.Pyakurel thinks that regular elections are different to by-elections and by-elections results seldom reflect on future election results.Sunday’s by-elections are taking place only for the 41 posts of certain local units. There are 753 local units (276 municipalities and 460 rural municipalities), further divided into 6,743 wards.“So the results of the 41 local contests are insufficient to draw definite conclusions about the future,” Pyakurel said. It could be an indicator to analyse anti-incumbency if the parties lose the seats that they had won earlier, he added. “However, the results themselves cannot be considered a solid basis to gauge the future poll performance of political parties.”Out of the 44 seats for which by-elections are being held on Sunday, 30 were won by the Congress in the earlier local polls while seven seats each were won by the UML and the Maoist Centre. \nNepali Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa, until recently a sharp critic of party president Sher Bahadur Deuba, now seems to be on the same page with the party chief.As the two leaders inch closer, Deuba has been entrusting Thapa with decision-making on major issues and the latter seems to be enjoying working closely with the veteran leader. Thapa stood against Deuba’s re-election as the party chief during the 14th general convention held in December 2021 in Kathmandu. Against Deuba’s bid for the second consecutive tenure, Thapa supported Shekhar Koirala. While Deuba defeated Koirala to retain the post, Thapa and another youth leader Bishwa Prakash Sharma were elected to the two posts of general secretaries from different panels.In December 2022, Koirala and Thapa again teamed up to challenge Deuba while electing the parliamentary party leader. Thapa gave his candidacy against Deuba, only to be defeated by a huge margin.Thapa did not give up. In February last year, Thapa again challenged Deuba by presenting a proposal at the Mahasamiti meeting and strongly advocated the idea of not forging any alliance for the elections.Thapa’s proposal came after the Congress decision to enter an electoral alliance with the CPN (Maoist Centre) and the CPN (Unified Socialist) in November 2022 was severely criticised by the party members.By presenting a separate proposal on the issue at the Mahasamiti meeting, which is taken as a policy-making body of the party, Thapa tried to lead on key policy issues.Despite the Mahasamiti meeting endorsing his proposal, leaders close to Deuba were against the proposal.The central committee meeting of the party in August also came to a decision close to Thapa’s proposal of not allying with other parties. While the proposal was partially endorsed, the meeting concluded by saying, “an alliance related to the election will be decided based on needs of the particular time”.Thapa also was against the party chief when Deuba decided to forge the alliance with CPN-UML, the second largest party in the House of Representatives, to form the government led by UML chief KP Sharma Oli on July 1. But Thapa, who had long been challenging Deuba, has recently developed close relations with the party president. The two leaders have been closely working to settle key issues related to the government and foreign affairs. Of late, Deuba has given Thapa important roles in inter-party negotiations and other tasks.Recently, Deuba picked Thapa over other leaders in the two-party task force formed to set the agenda for Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s China visit scheduled to start on December 2.Thapa also represents the largest party in another task force cobbled together to discuss Nepal’s proposals on the BRI Implementation Plan, where the UML is represented by Prime Minister Oli’s political adviser Bishnu Rimal and financial adviser Yubaraj Khatiwada. Earlier, ruling partners Congress and UML formed a task force to formulate the common minimum programme of the coalition government. While deputy general secretaries duo Pradeep Gyawali and Bishnu Rimal were taskforce members from the UML, Thapa and Prakash Sharan Mahat were the members from the Congress.Although they seem to be on the same page, party president Deuba and general secretary Thapa still have differences, says a party leader. The leader argued that the current situation has compelled party chief Deuba to work in coordination with Thapa as none of his other trusted leaders is as accomplished in getting things done. Besides, according to the leader, Deuba may be trying to create a bigger space in the party for his wife Arzu Rana Deuba, who is currently a foreign minister in the Oli Cabinet.It is not only on the BRI that Thapa has been involved as a key negotiator; he also played a crucial role to resolve the long-drawn dispute in the parliamentary endorsement of the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) compact in February 2022. Thapa was one of the key interlocutors in finding a way out in the MCC imbroglio when he helped to devise a 12-point interpretive declaration. This was at the time of a heated debate on whether to endorse the MCC compact through Parliament that had gripped the country.Despite playing a vital role in the compact’s parliamentary endorsement, the rapport between Deuba and Thapa did not last. So, many leaders still argue, it would be too early to say that the Deuba-Thapa partnership will endure this time.The party's publicity department head, Min Bahadur Bishwakarma, claimed that relations between the two leaders soured after Thapa decided to form his own camp. However, at present, an atmosphere of trust has developed between party chief Deuba and Thapa, Bishwakarma says. “The party president has a good relationship not only with Thapa but also another general secretary, Bishwa Prakash Sharma,” said Bishwakarma.Relations between Deuba and Thapa seem to have grown cordial compared to the past, and a few factors have contributed to this, says Geja Sharma Wagle, a longtime Congress watcher and a political analyst. “In recent years, Thapa has established himself as a leader who can shoulder challenges, a leader with vision and strategy,” Wagle said. “Thapa also has proven that he has the political acumen to pull the party out of difficult situations.”In Wagle’s reckoning, Deuba took Thapa into confidence after Thapa expressed his willingness to shoulder greater responsibility and come up with solutions on pressing issues. He is also ready to tackle the challenges posed by the emergence of a new party, adds Wagle, besides having a solid understanding of the party organisation.Thapa’s growing intimacy with Deuba means that his distance from Shekhar Koirala has increased. So far, Thapa and Koirala have jointly led the party’s rival faction and often challenged the party establishment on certain issues.“Maintaining a distance from Koirala could be Thapa’s tactical move,” says another leader of the party who is close to both Koirala and Thapa. “While contesting the election of parliamentary party leader against Deuba in late 2022, Thapa had agreed to support Koirala for the position of party chief in the upcoming general convention.”Working closely with party chief Deuba comes with both pros and cons for Thapa. Deuba has already declared his intent not to contest party presidency in the next general convention. The party statute stipulates a two-term limit for the party chief, and Deuba has already been president twice. Koirala, however, is preparing to contest for the party president.There are a number of second-rung leaders from Deuba’s camp who have been supporting the party chief, expecting his backing in their race for the party’s top post. If Thapa gets close to Deuba, they will feel betrayed by Deuba. In that case, Thapa may also lose out on the support of the old Koirala-Thapa camp.A former general secretary of the party says it would be premature to analyse the effect of the current working relations between Deuba and Thapa in the upcoming general convention. Should Thapa get close to Deuba, as reported, Thapa could face questions from his supporters. “Thapa established himself by asking hard questions of the party establishment including Deuba,” says another party leader. “How can he now be seen surrendering to the same leader?”But speaking with the Post on the condition of anonymity, other party leaders said that in the contest for the party leadership, strategy will prevail ethics. One of Thapa’s core interests in working closely with Deuba is to hold the party’s next general convention on time, they said. They also claimed that General Secretary Sharma and some leaders like Pradip Paudel are with Thapa on the agenda of a timely convention. But Bishwakarma, the publicity department chief, said that the growing closeness between Deuba and Thapa had nothing to do with the next general convention. \nFormer home minister and chief of Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) Rabi Lamichhane, who has been held in Kaski police custody for investigations, was brought to Kathmandu on Thursday evening for probe in a cooperative fraud case registered with the Kathmandu District Police.Lamichhane is being investigated on charges of cooperatives fraud, organised crime, and money laundering. He was allegedly involved in a fraud case involving the Kalimati-based Swarnalakshmi Cooperative.According to police officials, Lamichhane was transferred to Kathmandu after recording his statement on the charges of embezzling deposits borrowed from the Suryadarshan Cooperative in Pokhara.The Kathmandu District Court issued an arrest warrant against Lamichhane on November 17 for his alleged role in misappropriating funds from the Swarnalakshmi Cooperative.An arrest warrant was also issued against former DIG Chhabilal Joshi, one of the partners of Lamichhane in Gorkha Media Network, in connection with the Swarnalakshmi case. Joshi’s statement was recorded at the District Attorney’s Office in Kathmandu.The Kaski Court on November 24 extended his remand by an additional 15 days for further investigation. Lamichhane had been in custody for over 40 days when the latest remand was granted. While investigations in Kaski focus on cooperatives fraud, organised crime, and money laundering, Lamichhane is also implicated in similar cases involving Butwal's Supreme Cooperative and was previously questioned by the Rupandehi District Attorney’s Office.Following his statement in Kathmandu, Lamichhane will be returned to Kaski. Additionally, arrest warrants have been issued against Lamichhane and others in Chitwan.Lamichhane was apprehended by a Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) team from the RSP’s central office in Banasthali, Kathmandu on October 18, and transported to Pokhara for investigation. Previous probes including the one conducted by a special parliamentary committee alleged that he, as the managing director of the the now-defunct Gorkha Media Network, was involved in diverting funds from multiple cooperatives, including Rs30 million, into personal accounts. \nNepali Congress candidate Krishnaman Dangol has been elected mayor of Kirtipur Municipality in the by-election held on Sunday. Dangol secured 5,334 votes, defeating his closest rival, Shivsharan Maharjan of the Maoist Centre, by 779 votes.Maharjan received 4,555 votes, while Surendra Manandhar of the CPN-UML garnered 4,337 votes.The by-election was held following the demise of former mayor Rajkumar Nakarmi, who passed away on July 26 last year due to a kidney-related illness. Nakarmi, also from the Congress, was elected Mayor in the 2022 local elections.Kirtipur, historically known as a left-leaning stronghold, saw a shift in political dynamics with Nakarmi’s victory in 2022. Kirtipur was declared a municipality in 1997. \nKrishnaman Dangol of the Nepali Congress has maintained a lead in the ongoing vote count for the mayor of Kirtipur Municipality. As of the latest tally, Dangol has garnered 789 votes, while Surendra Manandhar of the CPN-UML trails with 666 votes. Shivsharan Maharjan of the CPN (Maoist Centre) has received 465 votes. Among independent candidates, Rajman Maharjan has secured 418 votes, Dinesh Kumar Adhikari 236, and Kabikumar Maharjan 58. Rastriya Prajatantra Party’s Dhruba Maharjan has obtained 119 votes, while Bhanu Rijal of the CPN (Unified Socialist) has 22 votes.   \nRojina Shrestha of the Rastriya Swatantra Party has been elected ward chair of Kathmandu Metropolitan City-16, securing 2,902 votes.According to the Election Commission, Laxmiratna Tuladhar of the UML came second with 2,220 votes, while Congress candidate Devendra Pathak finished third with 2,214 votes. Unified Socialist’s Min Bahadur Manandhar received 1,092 votes, and Shyam Krishna Shrestha of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party secured 774 votes. A total of 10,558 votes were cast, with 180 declared invalid. The by-election was held following the death of Mukunda Rijal, elected ward chair in 2022 with 4,018 votes from Congress. \nA man accused of threatening Nepali businesspersons by claiming to be a member of the Indian criminal gang Lawrence Bishnoi, has been arrested. The arrested is Harichandra Phuyal alias Navin Pradhan, 36, a resident of Panchthar, and currently residing in ward 13 of Mechinagar Municipality, Jhapa.According to police, Phuyal used Indian phone numbers to make calls and send messages to businesspersons, claiming to represent the gang. He allegedly terrorised them by demanding they apologise to controversial medical entrepreneur Durga Prasai, warning of dire consequences, including threats to their lives. The Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) apprehended Pradhan in Charaali, Jhapa, on Wednesday evening. Police investigations revealed that Pradhan acted under Prasai’s instructions. Authorities said Pradhan has a history of criminal involvement and was previously on the run. Two mobile phones were seized during the arrest, and further investigation is ongoing.  \nPolice have arrested two individuals on charges of fraudulently promising foreign employment.A police team from the Kathmandu Valley Crime Investigation Office arrested 39-year-old Suvarna Kumar Bal of Bakaiya Rural Municipality-5 in Makwanpur and 28-year-old Manisha Kumari of Brahmapuri Rural Municipality-3 in Sarlahi.According to the complaints with the police, Suvarna had promised to send one individual to Croatia, collecting Rs1.5 million, while Manisha had promised to send another person to Dubai, collecting Rs245,000. Both individuals went into hiding after taking the money.Suvarna was arrested from Bafal on Monday, and Manisha was apprehended from Gongabu Bus Park area, Kathmandu on Tuesday. They have been sent to the Department of Foreign Employment in Tahachal for further investigation and action. \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli, leading a high-level delegation, departed for Beijing on Monday via a special diplomatic flight operated by Himalaya Airlines.The President of Himalaya Airlines, Zhou Enyong, welcomed the prime minister on board.

Vijay Shrestha, Vice President of the airline, said, “It is a great honour for us to serve the nation by operating special flights for the official travel of the head of the government.” The Airbus A319, registered as 9N-AJK, departed Tribhuvan International Airport at 11:16 NST and landed at Beijing Capital International Airport at 18:03 local time.   \nHotel Yak and Yeti begins the festive season with a Wish Tree, where guests can fulfill wishes from underprivileged children collected from the Joint Disabled Unity Awaz Center, culminating in a gift distribution before Christmas.\nKajaria Tiles, produced locally in Nepal, offer cost-effective options with nationwide distribution, fostering construction industry growth.\nMG Motor has launched the S5 electric SUV, featuring an ultra-thin battery, single-motor RWD system, competitive range up to 525 km, and a price starting at 103,900 RMB, replacing the MG ZS electric SUV in global markets.\nDespite progress in reducing HIV infection and deaths in Nepal, deep-rooted social stigma against people with HIV persists, leading to discrimination in healthcare, education, and employment.\nDespite decades of malnutrition struggles, Nepal faces a \"double burden\" of obesity and malnutrition due to physical inactivity, processed foods, and inadequate physical activity, with only 10% of young children meeting WHO guidelines for movement, screen time, and sleep.\nAbout seven in 10 people in the country are facing health issues because of smog with the most common symptoms being cough, flu and breathing difficulties, according to a report by international insights firm Ipsos.The recent smog situation was declared a “calamity” in Punjab last month. According to the international Air Quality Index Scale, an index value of 300 or higher results is “hazardous” to health and Pakistan has regularly tipped over 1,000 on the scale.Around two million people visited medical facilities across Punjab with breathing problems and other respiratory diseases in a month as record-breaking smog choked the province.The Ipsos survey, titled “Smog in Pakistan: Awareness, Perceptions and Practices” and dated November 26, was conducted from Nov 18 to 22 using computer-assisted telephone interviews with a sample of 1,000 people from all four provinces and Islamabad.In its first section on people’s awareness and experience with smog, data showed that eight in 10 people, around 79 per cent of the sample size, experienced smog over the last month, with 100pc of the sample in Lahore experiencing it.It also revealed that 68pc people reported having smog-related health issues with 71pc in urban areas and 67pc in rural.The survey also highlighted the effect of smog on daily life, stating, “Over one-third Pakistanis found their daily household activities, work life, and social events being affected by smog.”It further said that Punjab was the worst hit among all provinces, adding that Lahore and Rawalpindi were most affected.According to the second section on people’s beliefs and perceptions, when asked about the primary cause of smog, 70pc of respondents said vehicular emissions, 63pc said industrial smoke and 37pc said waste burning. About 31pc chose brick kilns and 30pc crop burning, followed by one in five who believed it was the “wrath of God”.The data showed that 44pc of the people saw a lack of public cooperation and 37pc believed enforcement of law as the barriers in combating smog and air pollution.In the last section on actions and behaviours, the data showed that eight out of 10 people agreed that they needed to play their part in combatting smog. It also said that men, elderly and highly educated Pakistanis were more willing to cooperate, indicating that those who were more informed were likely to take responsibility.When asked to choose personal actions to reduce smog, 48pc said they were ready to switch to walking, 31pc chose public transport, 29pc chose bicycles and 10pc opted for new/hybrid electric vehicles.The report stated that out of 796 people who owned vehicles, “nine in 10 Pakistanis are ready to cooperate if they were asked to repair their vehicles and get certification from the government — a clear sign for the government to play its part in this regard.”According to the survey, three in five people were satisfied with their provincial government’s approaches to battling smog. However, it found that satisfaction decreased as the education level increased, which raised concerns about the relevance, priority and effectiveness of the government’s strategies in addressing smog.-In Association with ANN \nAlthough abortion was legalised in Nepal in 2002, unsafe abortions are still rampant in many places throughout the country, and women are denied services, a new report shows.According to the report prepared by Center for Research on Environment Health and Population Activities (CREHPA), and the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), one in 10 women seeking abortions at health facilities was denied care. Moreover, four in 10 women (42 percent) with more than 10 weeks of pregnancy or who were unaware of their gestational age were denied an abortion. “The most common reason for denial was advanced gestation age, with over 80 percent of denials attributed to this factor,” reads the report. “Denial doesn’t stop abortion; it drives women to seek alternatives. Sixty percent of women who were denied services by authorised health facilities attempted to end their pregnancies elsewhere.”Nepal legalised abortion in 2002, marking a milestone for women’s reproductive rights, their empowerment, and bodily autonomy. With legalisation, persecution and jail terms for women who terminated unwanted pregnancies ended, and unsafe abortions decreased significantly.However, the new report shows a vast gap in services, which forced women to opt for alternatives, including unsafe means.“Thirty-eight percent of women who were denied services turned to unsafe/unapproved sites for subsequent abortions,” the report stated. “Seventy-three percent of women who were denied abortion services were, in fact, legally eligible for abortion.”Access to abortion services varied based on women’s characteristics. Those under the age of 25 years, unmarried, childless, not working outside the home, of lower wealth, or seeking abortion solely for sex selection were more likely to be denied abortion. Additionally, women who were unaware of the legal status of abortion services also experienced higher rates of denial.The study was carried out on 1,841 women seeking abortion services from 22 government-approved health facilities in all seven provinces, including major cities—Kathmandu Valley, Pokhara, Chitwan, Butwal, Nepalgunj Kailali, Kanchanpur, Biratnagar, Jhapa among others.‘This study shows that progressive abortion laws alone are not enough to guarantee access to safe abortion for all women,” said Dr Mahesh Puri, principal investigator of the study. “Young women, those with lower educational backgrounds, and women from marginalised groups (such as the Dalit) are disproportionately affected by denials, perpetuating cycles of poverty and poor health.”Women who were denied abortion care reported substantial economic hardship, with increased rates of inadequate household income and lower labour force participation over the period of three years, according to the report.Women who are unable to receive abortion services were also less likely to achieve their personal goals. While 42 percent of women who received an abortion achieved education goals, only 31 percent of denied women did so. Similar disparities were seen in employment (54 percent vs 45 percent), child-related goals (65 percent vs 31 percent), and financial goals (66 percent vs 50 percent).Denying abortion care doesn’t only affect women; it has lasting consequences for the health of their children, according to the report. The report highlights the urgent need for targeted policies to bridge the gap between Nepal’s legal framework and the reality of service accessibility.“Ensuring that abortion services are universally accessible and affordable can help reduce economic and health disparities among Nepalese women and contribute to better outcomes for children,” reads the report.Experts say unsafe abortion is among the leading factors of maternal deaths. The study does not say anything about maternal deaths from unsafe abortions. Still, the latest census report by the National Statistics Office shows that of the total maternal deaths, six percent (37 women) had undergone abortions or suffered a miscarriage.. It is estimated that over 300,000 abortions are performed in Nepal in a year. However, the government data show only around 100,000 abortions are performed in a year at authorised health facilities. Experts say many abortion take place in unauthorised places too, which does not come into the government’s record. \nDusit Princess Kathmandu hosts a five-day trout festival showcasing 12 diverse dishes inspired by various cuisines, focusing on the health benefits of locally sourced trout.\nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nChitwan Rhinos have set a target of 162 runs against Pokhara Avengers in the ongoing Nepal Premier League (NPL) match at the Tribhuvan University Cricket Ground, Kirtipur.After losing the toss and being put to bat, Chitwan managed 161 runs for the loss of seven wickets in their allotted 20 overs. The innings was anchored by Ravi Bopara, who scored a crucial 51 runs off 38 balls, including three fours and three sixes, before being caught off Raymon Reifer’s delivery.Despite a shaky start, with Chitwan at 46-3 in 5.2 overs, captain Kushal Malla (38 off 23 balls) and Bopara stabilised the innings with a 68-run partnership for the fourth wicket. Malla struck one four and four sixes before being dismissed by Sagar Dhakal, caught by wicketkeeper Kushal Bhurtel.Deepak Bohora (2) and Hasan Ishaquille (14) fell early to Bipin Khatri, while Sohail Tanvir was dismissed for a golden duck. Luke Wenkestijn contributed 16 runs, but his dismissal to Bas de Leede left the middle order under pressure. Santosh Karki added 10 runs, while Amar Routela (12) and Sharad Vesawkar (11) remained unbeaten to guide Chitwan to a defendable total.For Pokhara, Bipin Khatri, Bas de Leede, and Raymon Reifer claimed two wickets each, with Sagar Dhakal taking one.The Avengers now face the challenge of chasing 162 to secure a win. \nChaaaiiittt…The spontaneous eruption of the sound of victory thundered through the neighbourhood of Nhyokha in the Kathmandu core. The line of a kite cut another. Looking out the window of her house, Sajani Shrestha saw children running full speed, shouting and fighting as they vied to catch the falling kite and thread. And craning her neck up to the sky, she could not count but only be mesmerised by the innumerable kites strewn across the skies of Nhyokha, Bangemudha, Indrachowk. “There would be so many kites that they entirely covered the blue of the sky, making beautiful patterns of different colours,” says the 51-year-old. “And you cannot imagine the number of times the call of chait rang in the air.”Clear blue sky and gentle westerlies, the season of kites has arrived in the Kathmandu Valley. While kites soared Kathmandu's sky mainly during Dashain, the kite season officially started in Nag Panchami (August) and ended on the Haribodhini Ekadashi (November). And from royalities to commoners, young and old all flew kites from rooftops and open grounds. Even those who did not, like Sajani, revelled in the live spectacle in the sky as kites soared and fought. With Bhimsen Thapa’s help, King Girvanyuddha flies kites The earliest written account of kite flying is believed to date to 200 BC in China. In Kathmandu, this tradition has religious and socio-cultural and environmental significance, says Tina Manandhar, lecturer of Nepalese History, Culture and Archaeology at Tribhuvan University. According to her, it is believed that kites in Kathmandu skies carry a message to the god of rain Indra that the valley's farmers have had enough rain for their crops. That is why Kathmandu farmers scolded anyone flying kites before plantation season.In an article ‘Changako Utpati Ra Bikas’ published in Gorkhapatra in 1995, historian Rajesh Gautam points to the lack of written documents indicating the exact time when kite culture was introduced in Nepal. Exploring different opinions on kite's introduction to Nepal, he writes that “some have opined the possibility that the skill and tradition of kite flying might have entered Nepal through India.” Yet some others, he writes, state that kites “came to Nepal from Japan during the time of [Rana PM] Dev Shumsher.”He concludes that most likely this tradition was introduced by Malla-era Newar traders: “But since Nepal’s relationship with Tibet and China is very old and direct, kites might have entered Nepal through the Newar traders who were engaged in the trade. One can estimate that the kite was introduced to Nepal during the (mediaeval) Malla regime.”In Social History of Nepal, TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi write that there exists documented evidence of the kite flying from the early 19th century. The authors state that Sundarananda, a contemporary poet, has mentioned that the young king Girvanyuddha Bikram Shah (r.1799-1816), with the help of Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa, flew kites from the towering temple of Taleju Bhawani, Hanumandhoka. And when the king's kite cut the kites of the youngsters, they were located and rewarded with money.In Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Sardar Bhim Bahadur Pandey states that “During the month of Kartik [October-November] young and old all flew kites,” suggesting that kite culture was ubiquitous in Kathmandu by the early twentieth century.Anticipations and preparationsKite flying in Nepal requires a kite, a lattai (a wooden spool), thread and majha (homemade adhesive prepared by boiling snail slime, rice or sago, and powdered glass from burnt electric bulbs and coated on the line to sharpen it for kite fighting).77-year-old Nirmal Man Tuladhar, an avid kite flyer and retired professor of Linguistics at the Tribhuvan University, explains how Nepali tradition of kite flying was both expensive and needing advance preparation.“In our times, it wasn’t easy to fly kites,” he says. “We had to prepare majha …And as Nepali kites are fighter kites, we mainly fought with other kites [which meant we spent a lot of threads].”This preparation needed first and foremost of passing a hurdle: securing finances and materials to fly kites. While lattai was a one-time investment that could be saved for years, kites and threads had to be replenished every time a kite was cut.“Those were the times when parents wanted us to be more focused in our studies. They only gave money [to buy kites] after immense pestering,” says 80-year-old Dwarika Nath Dhungel, former Secretary of Nepal government, speaking of the 1950s and 1960s.Biodiversity specialist and botanist Tirtha Bahadur Shrestha, 86, was born in Mahabouddha and began flying kites from 1951-52. He saved what little money he got for afternoon snacks to buy Hattimar reel, a brand of line wound in a small lattai, which was strong and sharp and where majha stuck well.Raghuji Pant, a member of parliament, also recalls the difficulty in securing money to sustain his kite flying in and around Kathmandu core in the 1960s and early 1970s. “Four to five of my kites were cut in a day,” writes the 67-year-old in his 2019 article “Changa Jastai Udi Hidne Man” published in Himalkhabar. “[This caused] the line in the spool to shorten. From Bhadra [August-September] to one to one and a half months after Dashain I spent flying kites. So, it was difficult for me to have enough kites even after getting money from grandfather, grandmother, mother and everyone.”Kites and thread secured, now began the crucial work of preparing and applying majha whose strength determined how well it cut other kites. Govinda Tandon, 70, a historian and heritage expert, who grew up in Battisputali, was also an ardent kite flyer.“Materials for making majha were prepared right from the morning on a holiday,\" he writes in his article “Dashainko Butte Changa” published in Gorkhapatra. “Because this work couldn’t be accomplished without a collaboration of 3-4 friends, a holiday was set aside for this. Moreover, a sunny day was considered appropriate. If the majha didn’t dry, the thread could turn moist, and so if it felt like the day wouldn’t be sunny, the entire plan…was aborted.”Kite makers, kite sellers and variety of kites One of the oldest shops in Kathmandu's memory, Shree Chitrakar Kite Center in Tyauda, Asan is bustling with customers during Dashain. “When my grandmother got married and came to this house at age 12 [in early 1940s], this shop was already here,” says its fourth generation owner 47-year-old Dinoj Chitrakar. “So the shop must be around a hundred years old.”Another shop that stands out in Kathmandu's memory is Manandhar Kite Center in Kalimati, established in 1949, and currently run by brothers Mohan Man and Sundar Man Manandhar.In his book Antar Taranga, artist and writer Manuj Babu Mishra recalls “a kite shop near the old halwai shop of Chabahil” in the 1940s. Dhungel and his 1960 batchmates of Juddhodaya Public School recall the kite shops from the 1950s and 1960s – Bekhacha’s Shop at Netapacho, Bhaicha’s Shop at Nhyokha, Lata Manandhar’s Shop at Maru, Kanchha Buddha Bajracharya Shop at Tyauda.Besides the shops, there were makers and sellers of kites cloistered in different localities of Kathmandu Valley.In Kwalkhu, Patan was a Joshi who made Nepali paper kites.“One day I accompanied my uncle to buy kites,\" writes Dibya Giri, 69, in his 2023 article “Changa” in Sahitya Post. “I was amazed to see the huge stacks of kites there. We used to call it the house of the kite maker.”In Nhyokha, Purna Bahadur Shrestha began making kites as a teenager and started his own kite business in the 1950s, according to his daughter Sajani.These kites, made out of Nepali paper, often had different paintings. Mishra recalls painting kites for the kite shop in Chabahil.“I went to that kite shop and with the freely available colours and Nepali papers, I spent my day painting faces, birds, animals, masks, mountains, hills, whatever came to my mind,” he writes in the book. “Such kites apparently sold well!”Most septuagenarians and older generations like Tuladhar and Tirtha Bahadur recall flying kites made of Nepali paper when young. Tirtha Bahadur says that kites from Lucknow began coming to Kathmandu only after the late 1950s. But at least a section of Kathmandu was flying kites from Lucknow from the early twentieth century. Vaidya, Manandhar and Joshi write that the Ranas and Shahs imported kites from Lucknow and that from them, their favourite employees also got to fly some. These kites were large and, in Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Pande writes that they were referred to as Lucknowia kites.Known for their characteristic hissing sound they made while flying, light body, swift movement and ability to take sharp turns, Lucknow kites were preferred by kite fighters.“Lucknow kites were lighter and could be manoeuvred well,” says Tuladhar. “Kites of Nepali paper were stable but difficult to manoeuvre. They were also expensive. So only some fighters flew Nepali paper kites.”The kites had different names depending upon their designs and colours – Ambe (a heart in the centre), Dibdibe (chequered), Pakhete (a different coloured paper on one edge), Sete (white-coloured), Nilchi (blue-coloured), Rate (red-coloured) and so on.The kite fighters preferred the strong and sharp Hattimar reel that came on a small lattai. The Belchamar reel was cheaper but weaker and prone to be cut by other threads. Kite fliers and kite watchers on rooftops and open groundsBibek Shrestha, 57, and his two brothers took stacks of kites and climbed their rooftops. The rooftops around theirs in the neighbourhood of Nhyokha – in fact in all core settlements of the Valley – were filled with kite fliers and spectators. Many risked precariously balancing on the sloped roofs.While Bibek and his brothers’ kites alighted to meet the sea of kites in the sky, their sister Sajani and other family members gathered around to revel in the live spectacle.Dhungel remembers the rooftops of Jhochhen and surroundings of the 1950s and 1960s swelled with kite fliers. Dhungel did try to fly kites. But he did not become a successful kite flyer. What he did become was, like Sajani and many Kathmandu residents, an admirer of kites soaring in the sky.“But more than engaging in my unsuccessful kite flying attempts, I enjoyed looking at the kites flying. There would be a big crowd of spectators. Females and other family members watched the kites fly as they ate meat and chiura. Some even drank and rejoiced as they flew kites.”When the age of cassette player and speakers dawned in the 1980s, songs blared from the speakers alongside kite flying. Chitrakar and Bibek invited their friends, put their favourite songs on speakers and spent entire afternoons flying kites, dancing, singing and eating.Away from the core cities, in the villages in the Valley, people flew kites in open fields. Like Dibya, who set his kite for flight from the banks of Godavari River in Tikathali. Chhauni was also a popular space for flying kites.Kathmandu’s joy in kite fightingBibek pulled his kite down and then manoeuvred it back up so his line touched his opponent's line from below and quickly reeled out his line. The resulting sharpness from the speed cut the opponent's line.Chaaaiiitttt………“The greatest fun comes from cutting another kite's string,” writes Tuladhar in his 1996 article “Cutting is the greatest fun” published in magazine Kite Lines. “With its coating of adhesive paste and ground glass, the string is as sharp and abrasive as sandpaper on your opponent's line.”Nepali kite, Tuladhar says, is made to fight other kites, and describes how a kite line cuts the other.“The technique is to touch your rival's string and immediately reel out line at high speed,” he writes. “The Nepalese style of kite flying is aggressive, and though the kites look simple, they are strategically designed for bringing down other kites.”At any given time, like Bibek’s kite above Nhyokha sky, skies above the Valley were filled with raging kites, swinging, coming down and going up as the fighters reeled in and out their lattais in ferocious attempts to bring down other kites.Meanwhile spectators cheered. “Even passersby stopped to look at the kites,” recalls Tina.The moment of a kite cutting was accompanied by the sound of chait, and children ran in the direction of the falling kite to grab it and the thread in what was termed as, Dibya says, changa lutne/dhago lutne.Dhungel always joined in to shout the chait resounding through the locality of Jhochhen and almost automatically his feet sped towards the severed kites' direction.“‘Oii leave that thread,’ the kite owner would scold me. ‘Why do you pull my thread, leave it right now.’ But I’d continue pulling the threads as the owner continued shouting. Other times I caught the kites that had failed to fly and dropped on the ground.”The fallen kites got stuck in the buildings, trees or poles, or glided down in the open grounds or paddy fields. Falling kites from the Kathmandu core settled down in Tundikhel covering it. Oftentimes kites fell on the fields to rest upon the lush paddy nearing its harvest.“Children ran straight into the fields to catch the kite,” says Dibya. \"They destroyed the crops by stepping on them. Some farmers chased them, scolding along as they did so and if they caught anyone, they slapped them.”Love and restrictions on kiteAmidst the raging kite fights high up in the sky, there were apparently also some quieter kites lingering much lower among the buildings or tree lines, for their goals lay in not ruthlessly cutting the threads of other kites but piercing softly through the hearts of their owners' love interests. During the Rana regime, there were designated public spaces to fly kites, writes Gautam in his article. Referring to oral accounts, he writes that the Ranas were particularly careful to avoid kite flyers around their durbars. This is because love-stricken men tied letters to kites and flew them into the durbars to their love interests among the nanis.He writes that the kites could be flown mainly on the grounds of Chhauni. Anyone flying kites in any other place and around Rana durbars were arrested.Pant also recalls love-stricken boys from his time. “Just as kites came in different colours and patterns, so did kite flyers,” he writes in the article. “Some wrote love letters using a few words in “symbolic language” on a plain kite and attempted to land it on the rooftop of the girl they liked. Some simply landed their kites on any rooftop if a girl appeared there and waited for reaction.”King Tribhuvan among kite fliersPande writes in his book: “Once or twice during kite season every year, King Tribhuvan went to Chhauni to fly kites. Legend has it that if the line of the king’s kite was cut, it flew to Lhasa. But since anyone who caught that kite received five rupees, everyone attempted to catch that kite.”In 2021 news report ‘Bhawanle Chhekidiyo Changa Udaune Aakash’ by Shivahari Ghimire published in Nayapatrika, cultural expert the late Satyamohan Joshi also recounts that “During Dashain, Tribhuvan came to the ground below Swayambhu to fly kites. […] He did not use the same thread to fly kites twice.”In the same article, Joshi says that the King also went to Budhanilakantha to fly kites and participate in kite flying competitions.End of season, end of cultureMohan Krishna Shrestha, 86, was born in Budhanilakantha. Every year, on the day of Haribodhini Ekadashi, he saw the annual fair at the Budhanilakantha Temple. He also witnessed kite fliers gathered in the open fields around the Temple.“Oh, it’d be a lot of people,” says Shrestha. “They came from all around Bhaktapur, Kathmandu and Lalitpur.”They flew kites on Ekadashi, Dwadashi and some even until Purnima.“They took all the remaining threads and kites that had survived Dashain and flew the last kites of the season,” says Tuladhar. “I remember my uncles, relatives and neighbours going to Budhanilakantha with their kites.”Joshi recalls in the 2021 article that King Tribhuvan also went to Budhanilakantha with his sons Mahendra, Himalaya and Basundhara. He greatly supported and also participated in the competitions there organised by the commoners. If he liked he gave prize money to the winners.This annual event lost its glory days after the decline in the open fields as buildings began to rise with the establishment of Budhanilkantha School in 1972, Mohan says.“The event survived in some form until the 1990s,” he says.But what happened after that?The end-of-the-season event in the 1990s was also an indication of the end of the age-old kite tradition.“If I go to my ancestral place in Asan to fly kites, it’s not possible for me to do that today because there are buildings everywhere,” says Tuladhar. “Cityscapes and urbanisation have created the obstacle for flying kites.”Dibya does feel like flying kites sometimes.“No space to fly kites today,” he says. “In the old times, there were river banks and open fields. Even if you fly kites, it gets stuck in somebody's rooftop or water tank or somewhere.”Yesteryear’s kite enthusiasts believe that increasing means of entertainment was another reason for the decline of kite culture.“When television came, kite flying started to slowly decrease,” says Bibek. “And then mobile phones robbed kite flying even more.”And so, when his sister Sajani cranes her neck up in the sky today, she rarely sees a kite.“Those days we heard one chait after another,” she says. “These days you won’t hear a single chait.” \nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nWhat animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. \nA few years ago, the government of Nepal attempted to obtain a sovereign credit rating. In simple terms, a sovereign credit rating measures a country’s ability to repay its debts. On November 21, 2024, Nepal finally received a rating from Fitch, one of three American credit rating agencies (Standard & Poor's and Moody's). The ratings range from AAA to D, with AAA being the highest and D the lowest. Fitch assigned a rating of \"BB-\" to Nepal, placing the country among the developing economies under a speculative-grade rating similar to Bangladesh (export-driven growth economy), also referred to as \"junk status.\" This means that Nepal carries a higher risk profile for investors compared to countries with investment-grade ratings. India has a 'BBB-' investment-grade rating and widely benefits from a more diversified economy and a larger domestic market. However, Pakistan has a 'CCC+' rating because of the prolonged economic and political instability. FDI statusGiven the recent Fitch rating, it is essential to look at how Nepal’s foreign direct investment (FDI) is faring. The trend has shown some volatility in recent years. In 2019, Nepal received approximately Rs21.3 billion ($190 million); in 2020, FDI decreased by 31.76 percent to Rs15.6 billion ($130 million). As post-pandemic recovery gained traction, the FDI rebounded in 2021, increasing by 55.04 percent to Rs23.6 billion ($200 million). In 2022, inflows decreased by 66.8 percent to Rs8.1 billion ($65 million), or 0.16 percent of GDP. In the first four months of the current fiscal year (FY) 2024-25 (July 16, 2024, to November 15, 2024), Nepal received FDI commitments of Rs17.64 billion ($130.5 million) across 163 projects, where the commitments were mainly concentrated on small-scale projects, followed by medium- and large-scale projects. Sector-wise, tourism led with 66 percent, followed by services (23 percent) and manufacturing (7 percent). The actual net FDI inflow, amounting to just Rs4.81 billion by mid-October, is like the last FY, where only 13.57 percent (Rs8.40 billion) of the committed Rs61.90 billion was realised. In FY 2021, the actual net FDI inflow represented approximately 34.27 percent (Rs18.56 billion) of the committed amount (Rs54.15 billion). Additionally, the automatic route for FDI approvals in the current FY facilitated 109 projects, with total commitments of Rs1.6 billion ($12.04 million), where the majority of investments were in information and communication technology (ICT), 70 percent, followed by manufacturing and tourism (11 percent each). However, FDI in Nepal remains a critical challenge because such an investment (net flow) as a share of GDP is less than 1 percent, and there is a big gap between commitments and actual disbursement. Burdensome procedures on profit repatriation and other regulations on external transactions have historically constrained FDI inflows. At present, FDI priority sectors are energy, infrastructure and IT-based industries, but the FDI inflows are unsatisfactory given the sectors’ potential. Regulatory hurdles, land use and remittance dependence represent missed opportunities to attract enough FDI to the country.Debt statusNepal’s public debt reduced from 42.9 percent of GDP in FY 2023 to 42.7 percent in FY 2024 because of a slight reduction in the fiscal deficit. This is a positive development, as Nepal’s public debt remains lower than the median for other Fitch 'BB' rated countries, which stands at 55 percent. The public debt comprises 49 percent domestic debt, mostly Treasury Bills and development bonds, and 51 percent external concessional loans with low interest rates and extended repayment periods. Although Nepal’s debt distress rate remains low, the country’s debt servicing costs have reached record levels in FY24, exceeding capital expenditure once again.Amortisation (debt payment) accounted for 3.9 percent of GDP and interest payments at 1.44 percent, meaning repaying the loans took up 3.9 percent of the country's total economic output (GDP). Although debt is manageable, the government spent more on debt than investing in development projects. This is alarming and interconnected because high debt servicing crowds out investments in infrastructure and financial sector development. Nepal also has decent external liquidity, with foreign exchange reserves covering over nine months of imports, above the Fitch 'BB' rated country median of five months. The financial sector, which suffers from rising non-performing loans and stagnant private sector credit, restrains profitability pressure due to the provisioning of bad loans. Moreover, limited credit availability and a struggling capital market, where the government took almost 11 months to appoint the head of the Nepal Securities Board (Sebon), deter investors' confidence.ObstaclesA range of structural and systemic challenges hinder Nepal's growth. First, frequent government and administration changes (short tenures of officials) impede long-term planning and undermine investor confidence. Nepal has made progress in the energy sector, such as exporting electricity to India and Bangladesh. Despite this, there are significant challenges, such as delays in project implementation hindering industrial production. Second, Nepal's low execution of capital expenditure, where the budget is mainly spent at the end of the fiscal year, leads to inefficient allocation and poor infrastructure development. Third, weak revenue collection (around 25 percent below targets over the past 5 years) due to unrealistic forecasts and ineffective tax reforms poses fiscal challenges. Inadequate public financial management, including lack of tax reform, narrow tax base, ad hoc exemptions and poor compliance, further complicate Nepal's business environment.Moreover, Nepal has become an import- and remittance-dependent economy, contributing to private consumption. This tendency will not drive productive investments or boost domestic job creation. Structural labour market issues compounded by high youth unemployment rates (22.7 percent) further constrain growth to attract new investments. Lastly, Nepal is highly vulnerable to frequent natural disasters and an economy that will graduate from LDC status in 2026, with a low per capita GDP of $1,400, has weak governance indicators, which collectively limit the country’s ability to climb the sovereign rating ladder.Way forwardNepal must maintain the rating, which can increase or decrease depending on its performance. It also indicates that Nepal is a good destination for short-term investment, but long-term investments require more caution. The rating will help attract foreign investment in government bonds and assist banks in securing funding. However, it might lead to higher borrowing costs in international markets compared to investment-grade countries. Nepal's access to concessional financing from multilateral institutions will help offset this challenge until it graduates from LDC status.The government of Nepal introduced an automatic route under the Foreign Investment and Technology Transfer Act of 2019 to streamline pre-approvals for investments up to Rs500 million ($37.6 million) across diverse sectors. Speeding up automatic route investment will enable investors to receive pre-approval online, particularly for investments in energy production, agriculture, infrastructure, tourism, IT-based industries, services and manufacturing, with no minimum investment limit for IT-based industries. Most importantly, removing burdensome procedures on profit repatriation and other regulations on external transactions would signal increased investor confidence and efforts to attract FDI inflows in Nepal. The Fitch rating should encourage the government to create a more favourable investment climate and improve governance and institutional quality, regulatory efficiency and ease of business.   \nNepal has almost everything it needs for prosperity: A strategic location, tourism potential, hydropower and a young population. Yet, we are trapped in a vicious cycle of low growth and high migration. When the Constitution was finally promulgated two decades after the launch of the Maoist People’s War, we expected politics to be our salvation. Unfortunately, it has become our prison.Nepal's low-growth, high-migration trap isn't just an economic phenomenon—it's a political protection mechanism that preserves an unsustainable kleptocracy and crony capitalism. While the World Bank calls for a “systematic assault” on economic barriers, what Nepal needs is a paradigm shift that will fundamentally transform power relations and dismantle extractive networks.Without such a shift, emerging political agency and a growing structural crisis will create a rupture. The absence of comprehensive political and economic reforms is a matter of serious concern for Nepalis. It does not just affect our graduation to a middle-income status, which has already been pushed behind schedule; it also impacts the lives of millions of people and determines Nepal’s development trajectory.The trapSince the World Bank's initial analysis in 2017, Nepal's “low-growth, high-migration trap” has deepened. According to the World Bank, low-growth fails to generate employment. As a result, a large number of youth are forced to migrate. Migration brings in remittance, enabling consumption but no productive investment. High remittance not only creates economic distortions, but also reduces pressure on the top leaders to deliver reforms. The lack of reforms, in turn, reinforces low growth.Despite poverty reduction, Nepal has been growing at only about 4 percent, marginally better than the 2 percent growth achieved in 2023. At this rate, Nepal will be unable to graduate from LDC at least until 2030.Nepal’s economic trends and fiscal positions are becoming increasingly unsustainable, creating pressures for change. For example, budget execution rates are below 80 percent, revenue collection is dwindling, capital expenditure is low, and the debt service burden is rising.While the per capita income remains at around $1,400, limiting job creation, the manufacturing sector’s GDP share has shrunk by half since 2008. While migration is increasing, fiscal indicators are worsening. Our dependence on migration is growing. While public debt is about 44 percent of the GDP, our revenues are shrinking. Debt servicing and financial management consume almost 20 percent of the budget, while development expenditure has shrunk to 19 percent and is poorly executed.Political agencyThe kleptocracy, patronised by top political leaders, extracts power and money from the people and the state. In doing so, they misuse state power, distort its bodies and hollow out legal institutions. Despite this, political agency has failed to drive change.Institutions like the World Bank have been advocating comprehensive reforms. For example, they want to break policy barriers, build new growth sources, revitalise agriculture, address migration issues and unleash financial reforms. These reforms would make the economy more competitive, productive and broad-based. All of these recommendations directly impact the existing extractive system dominated by crony capitalism, kleptocracy and political parties. Initiating changes would mean changing the status quo, which is why these suggestions fail.The failure of new parties to put pressure on traditional parties has not helped. When the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) emerged just before the 2022 elections, it was largely driven by the aspirations of migrant workers. However, the ethical dilemma posed by evidence of corruption of RSP’s founder has dented the party’s aspirations. When the current coalition was forged, one of the objectives was to deliver results to the people to show them that there was no need for new parties. This strategy has failed. However, the new parties have met the same fate, ultimately benefiting the entrenched leaders. One of the results of this mismatch between people’s expectations and political delivery is the reluctance of people to identify themselves with a political party. Rather, the disenchantment and dissatisfaction echo in social media in fragmented ways. Activism has not worked because people have become distrustful of not only political parties but also activists who claim to represent civil society.Incremental reforms?There are enough people who believe that incremental reforms in the economy will add up and drive change. Some people are also hopeful that the traditional parties are feeling the pressure and will reform, albeit slowly. Then there are others who think we must seek alternatives to the current political system. Many of them tout China as a model of growth and aspire to have “political stability.”None of these approaches will work, unfortunately.Traditional solutions offered by donors and development partners often fail because they cannot address political-economy factors and political dynamics. These solutions focus on the symptoms rather than the root causes. Incremental reforms are often absorbed by the system, with all its deformities. And when the reforms are significant, the kleptocracy swiftly neutralises the attempts.For a few years, the traditional political parties could create the illusion of change, but all that the superficial democracy did was maintain the status quo. The current political system is rooted in extractive kleptocracy because the parties need each other to survive. Reforms will undermine the sources of political power and wealth. Therefore, political reform is impossible without disrupting the existing political power models.The current political malaise has discredited the whole democratic system. Seeking an alternative to the democratic system, however, is not an option. According to renowned economists, democracies perform at least 20 percent better than non-democracies in delivering prosperity. Democracies can also deliver more investment, economic reforms and public goods.A likely ruptureYes, the emergence of new political forces has faltered. Yet, this is only a temporary blip. At least four quarters are pressing for transformation in our political and economic system: the migrant population, urban youth, a traditionalist nationalist force allied with the former monarchy and a liberal-minded civil society. Even if political agency and social movements have failed to produce well-thought-out political movements, structural factors will continue to push for change because the status quo is untenable, and it is little prepared for shocks that may come from unexpected quarters.New structural pressures are building: Demographic transition creates new demands, digital transformation rearranges political psychology and regional economic integration forces competitiveness. Demographic pressures, economic vulnerabilities, migration impacts and urbanisation pressures will continue to generate strain until the status quo breaks.Our hope is that political agency and the structural crisis will align so that we are able to manage the transformation in a meaningful way. Otherwise, instability and chaos will become unavoidable. \nAs Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli prepares for his forthcoming China visit, the political debate in Kathmandu has reached a fever pitch. Within the Nepali Congress (NC), concerns about whether Nepal should embrace loans or grants through China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) are rising. Recently, an esteemed Indian political analyst remarked in a private discussion that BRI could deeply reshape Global South’s development aspirations. For many low- and middle-income countries constrained by limited financial resources, the initiative offers a potential pathway to realise ambitious development goals, paralleling China’s rapid growth trajectory of recent decades. Despite contributing over 30 percent of the global economic growth, China’s development model, which challenges Western norms, has yet to be entirely accepted by many developed nations.BRI’s core tenets highlight inclusive development and economic partnership, inviting participation from countries across different stages of development and socioeconomic contexts. Its six economic corridors aim to foster sustainable growth across Asia, Africa and Europe through policy coordination, infrastructure connectivity, unimpeded trade, financial integration and people-to-people connections. Guided by these principles, the initiative seeks to address pressing global challenges, including poverty, infrastructure deficits, climate change impacts, unemployment and food insecurity. The initiative extends the principles of China’s open economy, offering an advanced framework for global economic integration that emphasises mutual benefits. As the global public good, BRI prioritises the free movement of goods, services, capital, technology and people to optimise resource allocation and maximise productivity through diverse, efficient partnerships. Chinese President Xi Jinping has framed the initiative as a 21st-century vision for an open socialist economy, emphasising equitable growth, cooperation and shared progress for modern human civilisation. As President Xi articulates, BRI is a modern extension of the Silk Road spirit—a “road of peace, prosperity, openness, innovation, and shared human advancement.”For instance, Uzbekistan, a landlocked country, made the high-speed train in three years with BRI; the hydroelectric plant in Ecuador has boosted its economy; and the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed train in Indonesia ensured connectivity. Moreover, China-Laos rail and other cooperation projects being implemented in several parts of the world have resulted in substantial economic benefits to the receiving countries. The initiative has contributed to infrastructure cooperation and has had more to do with business. For instance, ASEAN countries, China’s largest trading partners, now have a trade of $975 billion, while it was only $40 billion in 2000. This was supported mainly by better connectivity after the BRI integration between China and ASEA -N member states. China’s development approach, rooted in poverty alleviation and economic resilience, offers potential lessons. Since launching its reform and opening-up policies in 1979, the country has crafted an economic model grounded in structural adjustment, strategic integration with international markets and active participation in global economic governance. Over the past three decades, this approach has achieved transformative results, lifting over 800 million people out of poverty.BRI presents a strategic opportunity for Nepal to advance development projects as there is a lack of vital infrastructure. Nepali leaders, policymakers and scholars should engage with the framework to prioritise projects that reduce trade deficits, enhance connectivity and unlock new avenues for economic growth. Under the initiative, Nepal could propose crucial infrastructure initiatives, such as developing transport corridors, AI-driven smart cities and agricultural trade routes. Strengthening trade connectivity with Tibet and neighbouring Chinese provinces could open markets for Nepali products, including cattle feed and high-value crops. Additionally, Nepal should advocate for enhancing additional border trade routes—such as Kimanthanka, Tipla-Pass, Hilsa and Dhau—to facilitate greater economic integration with China.Rather than centring discussions on loans versus grants, Nepal’s leaders should engage in substantive negotiations with China to secure strategic commitments that align with Nepal’s long-term priorities. President Xi expressed his support for Nepal’s economic development during his visit in 2019, recognising the country’s latent potential despite its slower progress relative to nations with similar socioeconomic profiles. Nepal can capitalise on China’s expertise in rapid economic growth and infrastructure expansion by approaching the BRI as a nuanced, multidimensional initiative.BRI embodies various economic principles and aspirations, including fostering equitable international relations, creating novel partnerships and ensuring mutual benefit. The key tenets of BRI, such as diplomacy, resilience-building and bridging development divides, open opportunities for Nepal to participate meaningfully in the initiative. Related initiatives, such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, Silk Road Fund and global value chain integration, offer additional partnership opportunities and resources.Nepal should comprehensively analyse the BRI framework, identifying projects that address its economic and developmental needs. Oli’s upcoming visit to China is a critical opportunity to leverage BRI's transformative potential to advance Nepal’s prosperity. Positioning strategically within this global initiative, Nepal can commence sustainable growth and enhance connectivity with the broader international community.  \nAs the world marks the 16 days of activism against gender-based violence (GBV) with the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women starting November 25, it bears recalling the different forms of violence inflicted upon women and young girls and how effective these campaigns are. According to the United Nations, one in three women globally experiences physical or sexual violence in their lifetime. The reality is dire in Nepal too. The Demographic Health Survey 2022 reveals that one in three Nepali women aged 15-49 has experienced some form of violence. Further, with the rise of technology, women have been experiencing harassment, non-consensual sexting, hate and fear in online spaces. The unresolved and harrowing rape-and-murder of Nirmala Panta is an example of the pervasive and enduring nature of GBV in Nepal.Campaigns and activism hold great promise to challenge and confront the violence women face. In Nepal, the government, non-profit organisations and international agencies join hands to discuss the issues of women and find practical solutions. Yet their actions are mostly urban-centric, with rallies and programmes not reaching the grassroots level. For countless Nepali women in rural areas who face multiple layers of marginalisation, these 16 days offer little in terms of solace or change. Words don’t translate into actions even as their issues get the centre stage. Apparently, despite having abundant legal frameworks against GBV, Nepal ranks 71 out of 190 economies in the World Bank’s Women, Business and the Law Safety indicator, which focuses on four key areas: child marriage, sexual harassment, domestic violence and femicide. The UN’s report “Femicides in 2023” states that “home is the most dangerous place for women”. Nepal is no exception, as out of 21,568 cases of violence against women reported between July 2021 and July 2022, 80 percent were related to domestic violence. And intimate partner violence—a subset of domestic violence—remains the most challenging issue to tackle. Meanwhile, with the rise of artificial intelligence, deepfakes of women have become common. Our outdated cyber laws fail to cover new threats against women and leave them ever-vulnerable in online spaces; Nepal remains far behind in addressing technology-facilitated gender violence. While this slow progress is partly due to the enduring severity of domestic and intimate partner violence, which demands significant attention and resources from the government and other stakeholders, it would be dangerous to overlook online forms of violence against women. For women going through physical and mental trauma brought about by various forms of violence, no lofty words pronounced at forums offer relief. Addressing such pervasive issues needs practical actions like making them capable enough to recognise and resist domestic violence. It is also vital to goad survivors to break silence about the abuse they face, as according to the 2022 health survey, 58 percent of women who experience physical and sexual violence don’t seek support or speak up. If they did speak up, it would be much easier for police and other authorities to intervene and help. Yet more can be done. Alongside designated days to counter violence against women, as many women’s rights activists emphasise, there should also be year-round advocacy on GBV. Sensitising men about violence against women and bringing—and enacting—stringent laws to dismantle the evolving structures that perpetuate gender-based violence are the bare minimum needed to build safe spaces for women. \nMany may find a pair of recent decisions on constitution implementation and amendment in Nepal baffling. It was nearly five months ago that the country’s two largest political parties—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—joined hands to form a coalition government, an unusual practice in a parliamentary system. They argued that the need for the constitution amendment made them forge an alliance as such a move would need a two-thirds parliamentary majority and a broad political understanding.Months after the two forces crafted a coalition government with the promise to amend the constitution, a parliamentary committee formed a sub-panel to conduct a detailed study of the laws needed for full-fledged implementation of the constitution promulgated in September 2015. The Legislation Management Committee of the National Assembly has set up a five-member subcommittee to study how many laws still need to be enacted. An earlier study conducted by a similar panel under the leadership of lawmaker Anita Devkota had found that 40 laws need amendments or replacement to align with the constitution. The earlier committee’s report, which was endorsed by the full committee in June last year, made several recommendations to the legislature and the government to update the laws in line with the constitution. But instead of doing so, the government and the parliament have either not drafted the bills or sat on several ones in the House. Now, the upper house has formed one more sub-committee.The Congress-UML coalition floated the proposal of constitution amendment while without first doing even the basics to implement the constitution. They haven’t formulated laws to allow the provincial and local authorities to use the rights enshrined in the constitution. Chief ministers of the seven provinces have been continuously pressing top leaders in Kathmandu to make necessary laws. They argue that the provinces have failed in delivery mainly in the absence of their own police and civil servants. There are several other sectors where sub-national governments have failed to perform in the absence of necessary laws as required by the constitution. This shows the hollowness of the political parties’ advocacy for constitution amendment. Really, how can a constitution’s performance be judged and amended without first fully implementing it? And, will the major political forces that didn’t even formulate laws needed for the full-fledged implementation of the statute in the past nine years suddenly start working to improve the national charter? So the problem lies in the honesty of the leaders. It’s no secret that top leaders of major parties—mainly the Congress and the UML—were not in favour of the federal system. They agreed to embrace it in the face of a wave of movement in favour of state restructuring that picked up during the eight-year-long constitution writing period. While the Congress and the UML leaders accepted federalism reluctantly, CPN (Maoist Centre) chief Pushpa Kamal Dahal has often used federalism-related issues as a political tool. It was evident in the course of naming Koshi Province. While finalising the name, he first instructed Maoist lawmakers to vote in favour of naming the province ‘Koshi’ and later he provoked ethnic communities to keep fighting for an identity-based nomenclature. In sum, at the core of the problem lies the leaders’ reluctance to devolve the centralised powers to the sub-national authorities. Such confusion and contradiction will keep cropping up until the leaders are committed to formulating necessary laws and clearing the way to allow provincial and local authorities to exercise their constitutional rights. \nThe annual United Nations climate summit, COP29, where nations discuss the future of climate, wrapped up last Sunday in Baku, Azerbaijan. Even as nations fought hard to reach a fair deal, the conference ended with a new climate finance target or New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) of at least $300 billion a year by 2035. Some representatives stood from their seats and applauded; however, delegates from developing nations felt insulted and labelled the $300 billion a “paltry sum” as it is simply not enough to address their mounting climate concerns. Even though the pledge has tripled from the previous target of $100 billion, which expires at the end of this year, it is less than the $400-$900 billion that many developing countries demanded from wealthy nations. The NCQG serves as a financial tool for justice, holding developed nations accountable for a climate crisis that disproportionately affects poorer countries. Yet, the escalating climate crisis each year has not been matched by a proportional increase in climate finance to address it. According to a 2024 OECD/IEA report, only $179 billion of the $1,265 billion tracked in global climate mitigation and adaptation finance from 2021-22 went to developing nations, with just $30 billion allocated to the least developed countries (LDCs).Developing nations like ours need this fund to adapt to climate change as they progress. Climate change impacts are not equally distributed. Nepal is one of the most climate change-vulnerable countries globally, although it contributes a negligible 0.02 percent share of global carbon emissions. This means that the climate-induced disasters the nation is grappling with, like floods, droughts, heatwaves, glacial lake outburst floods (GLOF), and so on, are outcomes of global climate change, a crisis fueled mainly by the inaction of nations with substantial carbon footprints. This is the sad reality of several South Asian nations: By 2050, Bangladesh will lose 17 percent of its territory due to rising sea levels, around 90 percent of India lies in extreme heat danger zones, and Pakistan became the 5th most vulnerable country to climate change last year according to Global Climate Risk Index. Considering our susceptibility to climate change, platforms like COP are vital to inform the world about our experiences and demand the compensation we deserve. Nepal’s COP-29 priorities this year focused on safeguarding its mountains, ensuring promised climate finance, enhancing access to climate funds, and urging the expedited implementation of the loss and damage fund established last year. Under the leadership of President Ramchandra Paudel, Nepal conducted a high-level session on climate change, during which he talked about the impacts of the melting of snow in the mountains. Nepal’s participation in the previous iterations of the UN climate summit hasn’t been that impressive. Negotiating and presenting on such platforms require experience, research and preparation. More than anything, it demands sensitivity towards climate change, which our leaders seemingly do not possess. Besides setting an NCQG, this year’s COP also delivered global standards for carbon trading and mandated all 195 Paris signatories to announce more ambitious emission targets by February 2025. However, concerns over Donald Trump’s re-election as the US president overshadowed these developments at the summit. The US, even though it is the world’s second-largest emitter after China, withdrew from the Paris Agreement during Trump’s first term. Although climate finance this year did not meet the expectations of developing nations, it cannot be rejected, especially with the rise of right-wing politicians who are indifferent to the climate crisis. Regardless, Nepal must strengthen its domestic climate change policies and enhance its negotiating and communication skills internationally. It should also collaborate with other developing nations that are experiencing the negative impacts of climate change. It is time we stopped ignoring the elephant in the room.  \nWang Peng, a research fellow from the Institute of State Governance at Huazhong University, Wuhan, was previously Deputy Secretary-General of the National Academy of Belt and Road Green Development (NABRGD) Beijing. Peng, a keen observer of South Asian geopolitics, was recently in Kathmandu to participate in ‘Kantipur Conclave-2024’. He sat down with the Post’s Purushottam Poudel and Kantipur’s Jagdishor Panday to discuss a host of issues. Excerpt:How have Nepal-China relations evolved in recent times? Generally, bilateral ties between Nepal and China have been stable. Politically, China’s Nepal policy has been stable too. Even though the administration in Nepal has changed, Kathmandu still has a stable and friendly policy towards China. Relations are progressing steadily. But we still have room for progress. Nepal’s Prime Minister is visiting China in the first week of December. This is a perfect opportunity for the Nepali and Chinese governments to enhance mutual understanding and political trust. Face-to-face meetings between the leaders of two countries are crucial. Due to the Himalayas, many Chinese people, including me, consider Nepal a country far away. But actually, we are alongside each other, not far. Nepal is an hour’s distance from Lasha and a few hours from Chengdu, which is very close. Despite being a close neighbour, China is often accused of not investing enough in Nepal, at least as compared to its other neighbours. Why is this so? There is no need to compare countries as every country has its own conditions. China’s investment in Nepal is significant, especially considering Nepal’s current economic size, population, and capability to use foreign capital effectively. We may talk about the cooperation between China and Pakistan, with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) as a flagship BRI program. China indeed has a massive investment in Pakistan. China has good relations with Pakistan for many reasons, one of them being that Pakistani politicians usually do not play the so-called “China card”. Despite political changes in Pakistan, relations between Beijing and Islamabad are seldom harmed. China is equal to every partner within the BRI framework, so the key variable essentially is the local leaders’ political choices and their ability to build consensus in domestic politics.What are you trying to suggest when you say Pakistan does not play China card? Many Chinese International Relations scholars, including me, appreciate Pakistan. What we appreciate about Pakistan is that despite their internal political differences, there is a bottom line that none of them uses China as a card. Because of this, Chinese companies dare to invest in Pakistan. This is good—good for these companies and good for the local guys—and this has created more than 10,000 jobs for the local guys over the past few years. In this way, China and Pakistan have accumulated a high level of strategic trust. Non-intervention has been the fundamental principle of Chinese foreign policy. In most developing countries, the government often changes. The country’s people can change the government if they think it has done no good to the citizens. We only hope that politicians do not use China as weapons when fighting for power. So the goal should be to devise a win-win plan to benefit both sides. You mentioned China’s investment preferences abroad. But don’t you think that the investment decisions of a democratic government and an undemocratic one like China will be different? China is a democratic country. People say that China is not a democratic country since it does not have an election. But the Chinese leaders are under intense pressure to think about history. The Chinese government and the leaders should work for the benefit of all the citizens of the country, not just for their supporters. For example, Donald Trump doesn’t need to serve all American people. Even if he supports the people who supported him during the election, his work is done. However, in China, this is not the case. The Chinese government should reconcile different peoples and encourage joint development of the country. A country like China, which is big both in terms of people and land mass, will split if the government does not tread cautiously. That’s China’s nightmare. We have suffered many tragedies in history, so we don’t want this kind of thing to happen again. The Chinese Communist Party, government and high-ranking leaders believe in history. That is why they try to create or design five-year institutions, projects, and reform plans.For example, the Chinese still celebrate Deng Xiaoping’s legacy. Despite being the leader who was not elected, did Deng use power arbitrarily? No. He prudently used his power to ensure that even 50 years down the lane, the country’s people remember him as a leader who greatly benefitted them. Other Chinese political leaders have also taken responsibility for all Chinese people and have made significant reforms to create an environment for business, and for investment in new technology, such as AI and space technology. How do you assess China’s relationship with South Asian countries in general? We should not indulge in conflict. We need resolution and reconciliation with India in the border conflict. All the neighbouring countries, including Nepal, have no border conflict. Apart from India and Bhutan, China has no border conflict with our neighbouring countries. Bhutan is happy to sign a border contract with China, but maybe they are waiting for the message from New Delhi. China will not exert any pressure. It is reasonable for China to be silent about other countries’ internal affairs. Sometimes, the decisions of neighbouring countries are not suitable for China’s interests, but China often keeps quiet and waits for good things to happen. We don’t have any land ambition in our neighbouring countries; we have enough land. If so, why is there conflict in the South China Sea? We don’t have land ambition, so we don’t want an inch of land from other countries. At the same time, we are determined not to abandon an inch of our land.If you look at the United Nations P-5 countries, which are permanent security council members, China is the most prudent country in which decisions are not made by weapons. In South Asia, China-India relations have again started to improve. It's a good beginning. China's relations with other South Asian countries, including Nepal, are stable. China and India are ancient civilisations. We have enough power to solve our problems together. We don’t need a third party’s long hand. We don’t need this kind of teaching. We are brothers; if we have problems, we can solve them together. The best way to resolve the problem between China and India is to develop mutual political trust, security resolution, and economic cooperation, which I believe will happen. Thanks to the potential threat from Donald Trump’s reelection, the two leaders of China and India have used their political wisdom to make changes in advance and create a better atmosphere for the future. Apart from security, what are China’s other concerns in Nepal?The bottom line in China’s foreign policy with neighbouring countries is peace and stability. If you read the Chinese line, we admire mutual respect. We desire friendly countries to commit to ‘One China’. Second, China would also like to promote economic cooperation with Nepal. Not only with Nepal but also with all countries. We want a simple process of import and export, a good business environment, and transparency in law and policy. If the above-mentioned things are achieved, Chinese companies will dare to increase their investment [in Nepal]. Nepal has long been an adamant supporter of ‘One China policy’. But now it has also committed to uphold ‘One China principle’? What does this shift entail for Nepal?To be precise, there is no difference. China’s bottom line is principle; for our friends, that’s policy. If they accept the One China principle, they will conduct a One China policy, which means they will not develop official contact with Taiwan. Earlier in Nepal, there used to be a discourse that Nepal could be a bridge between India and China, but you have come up with a larger perspective that Nepal could not only be a door to South Asia but also to East Asia. Can you elaborate?We don’t say Nepal or any other country should do this or that. We say we expect something. Frankly, China and India are both robust in population, land mass, and economies. Additionally, India is a young country. China also has its own advantage. Nepal has been blocked geographically by these two countries. But Nepal can potentially be the hub, not limited to the periphery. At least in the next three decades, both China and India can offer the most attractive economic opportunities in the world. If Nepal treads cautiously, it can enjoy the benefit of its location. Geography is constant, but political geography is variable and changes.If China and India go against each other, it might be a nightmare for the Nepali people. But, if China-India come together, even if not like in the 1950s, to make a rational decision not to let the border conflict escalate and promote trade, Nepal can enjoy its location as the intermediary rather than as a bridge. Rather than a bridge, Nepal should be a port. In this way, Nepal can earn a lot with China and India because both countries should get permission from Nepal to use its ports to export and import the goods they want. Bring goods from China’s Tibet Autonomous Region to Nepal and then transit to India. Bring goods from Indian cities to Nepal and transit to China via Tibet Autonomous Region. It is a very short distance, and much better. China is never envious of Nepal and India’s bilateral ties. We will never put sand in the wheels of Kathmandu-New Delhi relations. We know you are friends. But don’t make the friendship exclusive; it should be inclusive.You mentioned that China does not meddle in the internal affairs of other countries. But China has tried to bring communist parties in Nepal together and has been holding ideological discussions with these parties. Isn’t this selective engagement a form of meddling?First, one should know that in China, “international affairs” (among the governments of sovereign countries) are handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (中华人民共和国外交部) under the central government, the same as in other countries. At the same time, “inter-party affairs” (between the CPC and all other friendly parties in the world) are handled by the International Department, Central Committee of CPC (中共中央对外联络部) within the Party system.The mission of both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the International Department of the CPC Central Committee is to promote mutual understanding, friendship and cooperation between the Chinese government, the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people and governments, political parties and peoples of other countries, but the division of labor between the two is slightly different. There are some misreadings and misunderstandings.First, it said that the International Department of the CPC only communicates with communist or left-wing parties. That is wrong. In fact, the International Department speaks on behalf of the Communist Party of China and all political parties around the world that are friendly to China, including both the ruling and opposition parties.Second, it said that the International Department had contacts with opposition parties in other countries. This statement is also wrong. The International Department and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have their own priorities. The ministry and the government agencies carry out diplomatic activities and naturally deal with the ruling parties of other countries.However, the International Department of the CPC Central Committee conducts exchanges with all political parties that are friendly to China, in line with international norms and practices. Everything is above board and conducive to mutual understanding, mutual trust and win-win cooperation between the two governments, two parties and two peoples.“Non-intervention in internal affairs” (不干涉他国内政) and “foreign affairs are not defined by ideology” (不以意识形态划线) are two major principles of the CPC and the Chinese government.As Sun Yeli, spokesman for the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) said on October 15, 2022, the CPC maintains different forms of contacts with more than 600 political parties and organisations in more than 170 countries, and the international circle of friends is growing.“The more friends, the better.” As Sun Yeli said, for a long time, and on the basis of the principles of independence, complete equality, mutual respect and non-interference in each other's internal affairs, the Communist Party of China has had extensive exchanges with friendly political parties and political forces of other countries, and its international circle of friends has been growing.In recent years, China has hosted the World Political Party Leaders Summit and high-level Dialogue, attended by more than 500 leaders of political parties and organisations from over 160 countries and more than 10,000 political party representatives. The development of political party relations has driven and promoted the development of state-to-state relations and enhanced the understanding and friendship between the peoples.Sun Yeli said the CPC attaches importance to exchanges with Marxist political parties in other countries. Through theoretical exchanges and policy dialogue, they jointly explore the path of socialist development suitable for their respective national conditions and explore their respective paths to realise the localisation of Marxism.“The CPC's foreign affairs are not defined by ideology,” Sun said, adding that the CPC is willing to make friends with all kinds of political parties of all countries, irrespective of the ideology they uphold, as long as they are friendly to China and willing to conduct exchanges with the CPC.How is China seeing Nepal’s Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s Beijing visit, which will commence on December 2? Nepal’s prime minister, especially from the communist parties, often visits China. Big promises and agreements are made during the visits, but they seldom materialise. How hopeful is China about Prime Minister Oli’s visit this time?I am not a foreign ministry official. So I cannot represent the Chinese government. Over the past decade, China-Nepal relations have made remarkable progress. Political mutual trust between the two sides has steadily increased, and economic cooperation has yielded initial results. There is an old saying in China, “haste makes waste.” In other words, whether it is to develop bilateral relations or the economy through economic and trade cooperation, these things must conform to the objective economic conditions and cannot be rushed. Steady improvement and steady progress are the best. \nFormer Indian chief election commissioner SY Quraishi is a strong advocate of credible elections and inclusive democracy. He has extensively spoken and written on how increasing flow of money in elections is taking away the level playing field for candidates from different backgrounds. During his recent visit to Kathmandu, Binod Ghimire of the Post and Suresh Raj Neupane and Rajesh Mishra of Kantipur talked to him on a range of issues from electoral reforms, challenges in maintaining election sanctity in the age of generative artificial intelligence, to why the world is swinging right. Excerpts:Elections and democracy are intertwined. However, recent election results the world over are being seen as a threat to law and democracy. How do you see this phenomenon?Democracy and elections are two sides of the same coin. Without elections, there is no democracy. And worldwide, for the past 10 years, there is a swing towards the right, even in the US. In India, of course, we have been on the right for the past 10 years and our prime minister got a third term, though with a bit of reduced majority.The other thing is that in the past 10-12 years, there has been a debate on whether democracy is on a decline worldwide. The fact is that several indices of democracy indicate the decline. But people’s will cannot be taken as a threat to democracy. Sometimes they go to the left, sometimes, they move to the right. We cannot call it a threat to democracy. The democracy indices which I mentioned have a different classification.First, there are full democracies. Then there are flawed democracies. Third is hybrid democracies. The fourth is an authoritarian regime. So even in South Asia, we have one or two countries which are authoritarian, like Afghanistan and Pakistan. Their ranking keeps going up or down depending on the electoral and democratic performance. In India, the right-wing is ruling, but they lost some majority. They are now depending on two other parties, which are not considered right-wing. Of course, Trump got an absolute majority this time winning both popular vote and electoral votes. He also won both the houses. So, this is what can make him dictatorial. As it is, he is mercurial, and everybody is speculating how he is going to behave. Let’s wait and see.We can agree that people cannot be taken as a threat to democracy. But can we say that the elections, rather than complementing the spirit of democracy, are turning into tools to endorse majoritarianism?Well, people’s will is supreme. If they have chosen absolute governments, if they have given large majorities, you cannot blame the people. Many times a lot of money is being used in elections, and only the rich people get to win elections. In India, for instance, 93 percent of MPs who got elected are crorepatis [multi-millionaires]. Now, law provides for a ceiling on expenditure, so that level playing field is established, where you and I can also contest.But then, the ceiling on expenditure in India has one flaw—it is only for candidates, not political parties. This negates or neutralises the purpose of the ceiling. You can’t spend more than 1 crore, but your party can spend 20 crores on you. So where is the level playing field? Some people say there should be state funding of elections. I oppose the idea but recommend state funding of political parties. It is difficult to monitor election expenditure because of black money. Funding political parties with cheques is what I recommend because it is easy to monitor. So you think election management is more of a problem than the electoral system?Actually, both are important, because obviously the management follows what the system prescribes. There are laws, there are rules, and they have to be followed. For instance, on political funding, there is a cap on expenditure provided by law, and the election management body implements it. Therefore, we have to improve both. Both are equally important. We say public consciousness has increased with time, but there are also concerns that people are picking right-wing leaders. So what is wrong?Actually, it’s a good question but difficult to answer. Why is it that the whole world is turning right? But there are also states like Austria where everybody was thinking the extreme right was winning, but then liberals won. So, there are exceptions. Maybe people want a strong and stable government, which has the benefit of continuity. On the other hand, such a government can be accused of majoritarianism.I heard your prime minister, Oli-ji, mentioning frequent government changes. Obviously, how can the government function with this kind of instability? On the other hand there is the prime minister of India who has been elected for the third term. It is the people's choice, and you can't fault the people. The people chose stability and a strong government, and we have to respect that.Are people not knowledgeable enough to pick the right representatives for themselves?This question is often raised. For instance, we were talking about crorepatis and criminals in politics. Almost 46 percent of MPs in India have criminal cases against them. When we talk to these MPs, they say, look, people are choosing us, so how can you blame us? That way the blame is passed on to the people.Why is the electorate choosing dishonest people against whom there are criminal cases? This debate leads us nowhere. So obviously there is something good these people with criminal background must be doing in the constituency. Maybe they commit crime outside the constituency and like Robin Hood, benefit their own people.Aam Aadmi Party was a new party, and won 67 out of 70 seats in Delhi. They managed funds through crowdfunding and volunteers. And they won hands down.What are the issues that have come up with the proliferation of social media and new media?Social media and new media have revolutionised communication. But, initially, when the election commission of India in 2012 or 2013 came out with some regulation, there was a lot of public criticism, which was unjustified. Social media is also media. So whatever applies to media will apply to social media. And in the election context, what applies to the media? Two things: How much money are you spending on buying space in the newspaper and how much money are you paying to the TV channel?Therefore, how much money are you paying to Facebook or WhatsApp, you have to account for it as well. The law on expenditure will apply to social media also. The second concern was how will the election commission catch the violators, as they are anonymous. The difficulty in catching them cannot be an excuse for not taking cognisance of their offence. If we cannot catch them today, tomorrow we will. How can something be illegal in a newspaper and legal on social media?Rumours always play a big role in elections. Social media has multiplied the problem a thousand times. Within two, three minutes, your country can be burned by false, fake news. Social media however has many benefits. For instance, instead of buying space in the newspaper and TV channel, through WhatsApp or Twitter you can reach your audience in two seconds flat.So social media is a double-edged weapon, as was the consensus in the Kantipur Conclave. And, you know, it is like a knife. Is a knife good or bad? If you want to cut an apple, it is good. If you want to cut a man’s throat, it is bad. It depends how you use it. Now, artificial intelligence has given rise to even deep fakes. But AI has benefits too. Through artificial intelligence, impersonation can be stopped. Voting and logistics can be monitored. But there is so much fraud, deep fakes, and hate. So how do you catch them? That is something we have to be wary about. Frankly, I am worried because its dangers outweigh the benefits. We have to put our heads together globally to make sure artificial intelligence doesn’t overtake human intelligence for destructive ends.In Nepal, both federal and provincial elections happen at once. India too is now mulling ‘one nation, one election’. What is your take on this?There are benefits and there are problems. Logistically, it makes sense. But one MP of Odisha posed this question: ask the people. What do they want? Poor people love frequent elections because this is the only way they can highlight their importance. Otherwise, how many times have we seen that posters are put up in a constituency with headings like ‘Missing’, or ‘Wanted’ [representatives]? Frequent elections make the representatives accountable.We heard you say that if India does ‘one nation, one election’, that will be the presidential election. What do you mean?During parliamentary elections, there are national and international issues. The issues are different in Parliament [national], Vidhan Sabha [state-level] and Panchayat [local]. I would like to say that the local body elections are as important, perhaps more important because they’re closer to the people.India’s prime minister initially said that there would be a national debate and a consensus would be reached. There was a debate for 10 years, but there was no consensus.If there was no consensus, the idea should have been dropped. But the government decided unilaterally that we will go ahead and set up a committee led by the former president of India to suggest ways to implement ‘one nation, one election’. In my articles I have questioned the propriety of a former president being drawn into a government committee.They have made some questionable recommendations. They say that simultaneous will mean Vidhan Sabha and Lok Sabha, not Panchayat. But the terms of reference clearly say that simultaneous means all three tiers. Then it says Panchayat elections can be held after 100 days. After 100 days, there is a separate election. It’s a new election and will require totally different arrangements. These are also not simultaneous elections.  \nNew Zealand all-rounder James Neesham is one of the biggest stars set to feature in the inaugural Nepal Premier League (NPL) T20 cricket tournament, scheduled from November 30 to December 21 at the TU Cricket Ground in Kirtipur, on the outskirts of the Kathmandu Valley. Neesham, 34, who has represented the Kiwis in 12 Tests, 76 ODIs, and 79 T20Is, scoring over 3,000 runs across all formats, will play for the Janakpur Bolts in this debut season of the NPL. Although Neesham hasn’t played Test cricket since 2016 and last featured in an ODI during the 2023 Cricket World Cup, he continues to be a prominent figure in franchise cricket globally. His impressive resume includes stints in the Indian Premier League with teams like Delhi Daredevils, Kings XI Punjab, Kolkata Knight Riders, Mumbai Indians and Rajasthan Royals, as well as appearances in the Vitality Blast, Bangladesh Premier League, SA20 of South Africa, The Hundred, Pakistan Super League, Big Bash League, Caribbean Premier League, and Champions League T20. Currently, he is playing for Ajman Bolts in the Abu Dhabi T10 League. Binod Pandey of Kantipur Daily, a sister publication of The Kathmandu Post, talked to Neesham through email about his upcoming participation in the NPL. Excerpt:What do you hope to gain from NPL, and how do you view Nepal’s cricketing landscape?I am really looking forward to playing cricket in a new country. I’ve heard awesome things about the passion the locals have for cricket and the beautiful surroundings of Nepal. So, I am expecting great crowds and a beautiful country to boot.As a renowned big-hitting all-rounder, how do you plan to leverage your skills to make a significant impact this season?My approach will be very much the same as the other leagues I play in. I like to think I can contribute in all facets of the game and that will be my primary objective.Having played with and against some of the world’s best cricketers, how do you think that experience will contribute to the success of Janakpur Bolts?I’m sure I will be drawing on some of our local players’ knowledge of conditions and opposition, but I do hope my experience will enable me to help the team in the ever changing match scenarios you find yourselves in when it comes to T20 cricket. What motivated you to choose Janakpur Bolts?I have recently started playing with the Bolts franchise in a few other competitions and I was keen to maintain that connection with the group, particularly in light of the positive experiences I have had with them so far. You’re famous for your sense of humor on social media. How do you plan to connect with fans during your time with Janakpur Bolts?I always love spending time with the fans whenever I play. They are the bedrock of our sport and without them the game would be a very boring place. Like I said earlier, I’ve heard such great things about Nepal’s passion for the game. I hope my performances can help ignite that further.Besides cricket, what are you most excited to experience and explore in Nepal?Whenever I visit a new place I always look forward to experiencing local cultures. Nepal’s beauty is well documented so being able to experience that first hand is an exciting prospect.Do you have any plans to explore Nepal beyond cricket? Perhaps an Everest trek someday, following in the footsteps of your compatriot Adam Parore?If the opportunity arises in the future, I would certainly consider it. Although I think my main focus this trip will be on cricket!Lastly, what message would you like to share with the fans of Janakpur Bolts?⁠Get yourselves down to the ground and support the boys—we will do our very best to put on a show for you all! \nIndian Political Scientist Pratap Bhanu Mehta has served on many central government committees, including India’s National Security Advisory Board and the Prime Minister of India’s National Knowledge Commission. A distinguished academician, Mehta has taught at Harvard, Princeton and JNU. Mehta, who was recently in Kathmandu for the fourth edition of Kantipur Conclave, talked to Purushottam Poudel and Jagdishor Panday on a range of issues. Excerpt:How can we hold populist leaders accountable? Populist leaders who rise to power questioning traditional political parties and elites, seldom entertain the questions they themselves get. Let alone be accountable, the populist leaders even disagree with how they are described. If we talk about Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, you see him most of the time at election rallies. There is a joke in India that it is always in election mode. Why should they be accountable to intermediate institutions when they are accountable to the people themselves? The essence of populism is to, in a sense, say that there is nothing between them and the people. And they feel like, who are the other people to ask them questions? When they get reelected with people’s mandate, what better accountability can there be? In the age of information technology, populists speak directly to the people. Like Indian Prime Minister Modi, Donald Trump, the newly elected President of the US, had a similar approach during the US election. One short video can reach millions of people, and there are Elon Musk-like people who make sure that such a video reaches the masses.When they are directly connected to the general public, they feel like they need not be accountable to a certain group of people in society, let’s say, elite professionals. Populism is not a new phenomenon, but with the rise of social media, it seems to be gaining momentum. Can we differentiate between populism pre-social media and post-social media? We should not exaggerate the importance of social media for the rise of populism. When we look at the Bharatiya Janata Party, the major ruling party of India, the remarkable thing is how hard they work in old-fashioned campaigns; they knock on people’s doors to reach out to them. Trump did rallies after rallies before the US presidential election, so it is not necessary to buy the myth that it is the only social media that ignites populism. However, I do not want to discredit social media. The thing that is easy to do with social media is to destroy the credibility of old elites. There is an asymmetry between truth and doubt. If I want to create doubt about you, it’s easy; I can cook up something stressing that what I claim is true. And we are in a moment where most authority structures are collapsing under the weight of that doubt. That is what all populist leaders thrive on. All they need to do is create doubt about the other side. They don’t have to test whether their claims are valid. Given the velocity at which social media works, fake information disseminates easily. If someone makes a provocative clickbait tweet, by the time the other side collects accurate information for clarification, thousands of people would already have seen the tweet.Soon after the printing press was invented in Europe in the 16th century, one consequence was a total collapse of the authority of the Catholic Church. After the press, people started to interpret things in their own way. The printing press coincided with two things: a great democratisation of knowledge and, on the other hand, a total collapse of authority. Populists like the collapse of authority because that creates space for them.Therefore, I think we are in a period of trial and error. For example, there was great optimism that after the Arab Spring, social media would help democratisation. But we now realise that more than creating conditions for emancipation, it is mobilising hate in society. For me, the more critical question for democracy is the ownership of social media. Right now, social media is not only a medium. It is embedded in a structure of private ownership whose motive is profit. When your revenue depends on the number of likes you get, you will speak or write in a way that gathers you more likes. So it is a big elephant in the room of democracy, just like it was for the mainstream media many years ago. During Modi’s first term, Sushma Swaraj led the foreign ministry. In his two latest terms, S Jaishankar has been doing so. Do you find any differences in their styles, or can we term Swaraj a liberalist and Jaishankar a realist? In international relations, as a cardinal rule, you always watch what people do, not what they say. I mean, personality becomes their statement in most cases. Swaraj was a very adept and endearing politician. She knew how to talk like a politician. There was something charming about her. But I don’t think that is the key difference here. When it comes to decision-making, the Indian power structure is very centralised. Foreign policy perhaps more so. Additionally, I do not think there has been a major shift in foreign policy in the three terms of Modi. The objective remains the same: to create maximum space for India’s development. India is always in an interesting position in the region, being friends with everybody and having better relations with everyone. It is the only power that can talk to Russia, America, Iran, and Israel; this is a remarkable achievement. In the neighbourhood, I think it is a bit different. Manmohan Singh represented a generation that was convinced that the fate of the subcontinent was tied together. India is in the region; it cannot claim to be a global leader if it doesn’t do well in its own region. I think the present regime in India thinks that India can transcend its region. They might think that they are the big power, and they deal with big powers. I see that the present government has invested less in the region compared to the previous government. The second big change is cultural, which is also reflected in policy. I think 15-20 years ago, Indian politicians and civil society had more broad-spectrum relations with politicians and civil society in our neighbouring countries. When disputes arise in the region, social familiarity can help get over them. Familiar relations also allow you not to focus just on the near future and on tactical gains. But due to the centralised policymaking in India, I see less public interest in India’s neighbourhood. I see much less intelligent discussion of our neighbourhood in India now than 10 years ago. Due to which we are constantly surprised by what’s happening in our neighbourhood. Which also shows that we have less social connection. Are you suggesting Modi’s ‘neighbourhood first’ policy has been a failure? To adjudicate on success or failure, you require prior account of your objective. At one level, you could say that. But, on the other hand, in Sri Lanka, India did well while addressing the debt crisis. There was also a period of blockade in Nepal years ago. India needs to reflect: Can we actually coerce our neighbours to do things we want? That’s not what we should do. Being of considerable power means we can care deeply about our neighbour’s well-being. The axiom should be that if Nepal and Bangladesh or any of the South Asian countries do well and grow, it’s to India’s benefit. Government comes and goes, but development remains. I don’t see that kind of commitment from India. Instead, I see it as being guided by geo-strategic considerations vis-à-vis China. India should not have a veto on third-party investment in any of the neighbouring countries, including Nepal. Ultimately, if investment comes to Nepal, it will benefit India. Honestly, I feel that our neighbouring countries’ leadership doesn’t help; they often try to trade off their short-term benefit with the long-term benefits of the country; they are often found using one card against another neighbour. Good relations between countries are often built on creative work of civil society, businessmen, and other sectors. Modi travels across the world to participate in different forums; plus he is an election man. How much time can he spare for neighbouring countries? Other sectors of India are investing less in the neighbours; if you think that’s a failure of India’s foreign policy, then yes, I also would say it is a failure. When it comes to India’s relations with other South Asian countries, why is China such a big concern?I will be very honest, there are many politicians who overplay China when it comes to relations with India, and vice-versa. Former president of Sri Lanka Mahinda Rajapaksa tried to do the same. The new government of the Maldives came in so hostile to India, expelled Indian troops soon after being elected as president. However, we have completely made up with them. The Maldives also realised that it struggles without Indian tourism. The problem is that some people in our political class, intelligence services and bureaucracy try to be clever by half. When it comes to China in South Asia, to be fair to the Indian establishment, they are actually quite sophisticated in their thinking about global chess moves. India is clear what its development interests are. And it is going to engage with whoever serves those interests. As I have already mentioned, India is the only power which is engaged with every great power. I think it’s time to evolve to a detente with China after the Galwan clash. Relations are opening up again. When it comes to South Asia, it is not only about what India thinks but also what China does. When it comes to India, the biggest puzzle is that India could not fully understand China’s motives. And this is not only a problem of India but of most of the world. It is hard to read Chinese preferences.The big tragedy and frustrating thing about foreign policy discussions in South Asia is that we know our stories, we talk, we write, but we have absolutely no idea what the Chinese preferences are in the countries in the region. So my own sense in the India-China relationship is going to be driven more by what China does. If China makes a conciliatory move, India is going to respond.With Trump being re-elected the US President, how will the India-US relations fare during his second term?It seems like the Trump administration will have a pro-India team. Trump has picked Mike Waltz as the National Security Advisor. Waltz used to be the head of the Indian caucus, and Marco Rubio is Secretary of State. Both are pro-India whereas they are bulwarks against China. So if you actually look at his team, India is happy.On the other hand, he has contradictory interests. The Americans have an interest in promoting India in the global system, at least as a kind of balance against China. And I think one of the things the US has realised is that India is not going to be any ally but just a friend. There used to be a joke in the US that Pakistan is an ally, but not a friend. India is a friend, not an ally. So now they have learned to deal with India differently. Additionally, Indian Prime Minister Modi has good relations with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which is very important to the US.Despite all this, I think there is going to be friction or at least possibly friction in trade policy. For example, Elon Musk wants Starlink to come to South Asia, which is going to be tricky for India.The other area that would create friction with Trump in the Oval Office is the issue of climate, which also matters to Nepal. With Trump, there could be severe consequences, and the worst of it will hit South Asia.How do you think the twin developments of India-China rapprochement and Modi’s rapport with Trump will play out?India was actually comfortable with administrations of both the Democrats and Republicans. The Democrats sometimes lecture India a bit more, but the truth is there is a bipartisan consensus on India in the US. Given that the US is paranoid with Russia and Iran, who would have thought that India will have close relations with both these countries? So there is a bipartisan consensus.The Indian elite is now completely merged with the elites of the US. Every single ideological strand of US politics has a prominent Indian-American face. India-US relations are beyond geo-strategy. In my opinion, geo-strategy is the least interesting part. There are very few families in India’s elites who now don’t literally have family connections in the US.The governments of two countries might quarrel, geo-strategy will take its place, but the social dynamics of the relationship are much more powerful in a way which India can never have with China or even with Europe excluding the UK.However, India needs both the US and China. It needs the US for high-tech stuff. It needs China for lots of cheap intermediate imports to power its own industralisation.On the rapprochement between India-China, China reached out considering the possible Trump tariffs. China too will need some export partners.When India needs China for its industralisation why is Nepal’s economic ties with China a matter of concern for India?In South Asia, China is all in. We’re all reliant on Chinese imports, not just consumer goods, but even to power whatever industries we have. China is increasingly becoming a technological powerhouse. Nepal can be like India, it doesn’t have to choose anyone. Either India should invest in the development of Nepal or let others do so.It just has to reassure both partners that it’s not doing anything that’s going to be fundamentally detrimental to the relations with both the countries.India-China rapprochement is the best thing that can happen for Nepal.Though we feel that we know, we still fail to understand what China wants from the region. It might want assurance from Nepal that there is no anti-China activity. But, what beyond that? Honestly, no one knows.Many of the Chinese projects in the region do not make any economic sense. It seems China is using its economy to actually please the leadership of those countries. China has distorted the political systems of these countries by using its economy. If not, why would someone invest in Hambantota port in Sri Lanka knowing it is not economically viable? I think the interesting question is whether China will now take a more mature view in the relationship. It will be in South Asia’s interest if both India and China take a more mature view that clearly defines their core interests.India and China are both accused of influencing Nepal’s internal affairs. But it’s also the fact that internally Nepali forces also invite that influence. They play their factional politics using India and China. So the Nepali establishment has to be clear not to play this game.What in your opinion would most boost Nepal-India relations?Good relationships of countries depend on lots of things, along with people-to-people relations. When it comes to Nepal-India relations, there is an open border which takes our relationship to a different level and we take it for granted. Besides, business interests in both countries are something that promotes the relationship to different levels. Despite the Sino-US relations worsening, the creators of American capital urged the need of China for their economy. Same with Sino-India relations.Are you suggesting all political differences be kept at bay and Nepal-India focus on economic relationship?Nepal has to think about what is in its interest, but it has to take some intelligent strategic calls. Can Nepal get Tata, Adani and Ambani groups to invest in Nepal? I doubt it. But, if that happens, other trade stuff will automatically follow.To be honest, the political dispute between Nepal and India won’t be solved anytime soon. How can the government of both sides convince the people on the map and border issues even if they want to resolve it?The problem is that politicians of both our countries use those political disputes for domestic mobilisation. There have been politicians in Nepal who are tempted to use the anti-India card in popular politics. And there are politicians in India, a civil society structure that is very tempted to use Nepal in domestic politics. One should remember that using a foreign policy issue for domestic consumption is not something fruitful.There are media reports creating a narrative that India is unhappy with KP Sharma Oli and especially his impending China visit. Should the China visit by Nepali prime minister be a matter of concern for India?I fail to understand why India gets worried about this kind of thing. The nature of Nepal-India relations should be like they can walk in and out anytime. But it is not obvious that India is signalling that they are not happy with Nepali prime minister’s China visit.  \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli is preparing to visit China in the first week of December. It will be his first bilateral visit after assuming the office in mid-July. Nepali prime ministers generally go to New Delhi first. Sudheer Sharma, former editor-in-chief of Kantipur daily, has recently published a pair of books on Nepal-China relations—‘Himalpari ko Huri’ and ‘Bhikshu, Byapar ra Bidroha’. He also frequently writes on Nepal’s relations with its two big neighbours. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Sharma on the eve of Oli’s China visit. Prime Minister Oli is all set to visit China next month. Many find it curious that he decided to go to Beijing first before visiting New Delhi. How do you see this development?Traditionally, Nepali prime ministers have given high priority to visits and engagements with our two neighbours–India and China. This is natural. Generally, the prime ministers first visited India and then went to China. I believe Prime Minister Oli tried to do the same. We see regular engagements with New Delhi at various levels. Prime Minister Oli had met his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York in the last week of September. In August, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba visited India and met Prime Minister Modi and her counterpart S Jaishankar, among other key officials there. But Delhi has yet to extend the invitation to the prime minister. So he seems to have decided not to defer his foreign visits for long and chose to visit Beijing first. We have to see this in two perspectives. Prime Minister Oli is visiting China at the invitation of Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang and he is also going to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping. Even in the past, Oli developed good relations with Chinese leaders. So, there are expectations that he may make the visit fruitful. An equally important concern is whether this visit impacts our relations with the southern neighbour India. I think the prime minister should focus on implementing the agreements reached during his previous visits to Beijing and during Chinese leaders’ Nepal visits. He should be mindful of not irking the southern neighbour while reaching any agreement with the northern one. I believe the prime minister is conscious of this.India often seems anxious about Chinese involvement in Nepal. Do you see any risk of this visit increasing the distance between Oli and India?Maoist leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal visited China first after he became prime minister in 2008. Even in the past, some Nepali prime ministers including Tanka Prasad Acharya went to China on their first official visit. This is not unusual. The two prime ministers—Oli and Modi—recently met in New York. India doesn’t seem ready to intensify bilateral engagements with Nepal immediately. So it is natural for the prime minister to increase engagements with China, without taking any steps that could provoke India. We should stop seeking Indian signals when dealing with China, and vice versa. We should maintain parallel relations with both the neighbours without antagonising any side.In this context, what should be the prime minister’s priorities during his China visit?We have to end our chronic problem of signing agreements and not implementing them. We make announcements and forget them. There are also some infrastructure projects China pledged to develop but there is little progress. So the prime minister should draw the Chinese leadership’s attention and press them to complete the projects on time. Some important projects such as Mugling-Pokhara and Narayanghat-Butwal road upgradation by the Chinese side have been slow, causing hardships to people. Even such issues should be communicated to the political level. Also, there are several commitments made by the Chinese government but left unimplemented. This creates an impression that China makes big promises but doesn’t keep them. Prime Minister Oli often highlights the Tokha-Chhahare road upgrade project under Chinese support but there is no satisfactory progress. Progress on preparing the detailed project report (DPR) on Nepal-China cross-border railway is unclear as well. Nepal expected some substantive support from China to make the Pokhara international airport financially feasible. Some concrete steps are needed to operate this airport. There are reports that the government has requested China to convert the loan taken to develop the airport into a grant and the prime minister will push for this during his visit. It will be an achievement if the prime minister succeeds in this. In the course of writing your recent books, you extensively interacted with Chinese officials and experts, as well as with their Nepali counterparts. What are the major factors delaying the projects? Is it lack of preparation on the Nepali side or is there any problem on the Chinese side?First, we [Nepalis] sign agreements but don’t work seriously to implement them. This is true in the case of agreements with other countries as well. We are negligent. Red tape is another problem. Third, China gives less priority to small countries like Nepal as it has so many big issues with other countries. We have to constantly follow up with them to speed things up. In the past, the two sides agreed to open more border points. This should be expedited. The people-to-people relations on the border areas were historically based on social interactions at the community level. People used to trade, marry those from the other side and interact in various ways. Of late, despite progress on infrastructure development, social engagement has been hindered. This should be rectified and new border points should be opened at Dolpa, Mustang, Gorkha, Dolakha, Taplejung, and Sankhuwasabha. We should think beyond the Capital-centric approach. This will help strengthen relations at the people’s level and give alternatives in our connectivity. We should put connectivity at the core of our relations with the two neighbours. In the past decade, we have made good progress in improving connectivity with India. A study report has been prepared on the Raxaul-Kathmandu railway project. We are building an expressway linking Kathmandu and the southern belt of the country. Integrated check posts (ICPs) have come into operation along Nepal-India border points. Cross border electricity transmission lines have been built and we have increased energy trade with India. We have thus progressed in deepening connectivity with India. We lack reliable north-south highways. Therefore, the prime minister should make connectivity a major agenda of his China visit. Given the lacklustre performance of past projects, can we be optimistic about big cross-border infra projects under Chinese help?Nepal and China have committed to run some projects under the Trans-Himalayan Multi Dimensional Connectivity Network (THMDCN) concept. A key component of this concept is to upgrade connectivity between Kathmandu and Kerung that includes roads as well as a railway. The concept also envisions operating other border points. The railway project requires more study and investment and needs to consider various other factors. For now, we should prioritise opening the aforementioned border points. The Korala border point at Mustang has huge potential. Nepal is making a road that connects Mustang with the Sunauli border point with India. Centuries ago, people from Banaras used to travel to Tibet via Mustang through this route. It can be revived and made a trilateral trade route between Nepal, India and China. Similarly, Limi in Humla, Olangchugola in Taplejung, among others places, can be developed as alternative routes. As far as Kerung-Kathmandu connection is concerned, let’s first give priority to building a reliable highway. The railway project should be developed with a broader understanding between Nepal, India and China. Beijing will develop such a big project only with the big Indian markets in mind. More importantly, there are some signs of improvements in India-China relations. We have to use this as an opportunity.There are differences in the way we work and the Chinese do and there are systemic and linguistic differences as well. These factors are often blamed for lack of progress in development activities carried out with Chinese support. Can Nepalis work closely with Chinese, just like we do with Indians?Until a decade ago, several projects developed under Indian support were left in limbo. In 2015, India imposed a blockade against Nepal and that sparked anti-India sentiment. Then, India expedited several projects. This drastic change became possible as the political leadership in India realised its mistake and showed the commitment to improve things.But the same thing is not happening with China because there is a “great wall” between Nepal and China when it comes to understanding each other. The Chinese haven’t understood Nepali context. The northern neighbour should be more open and liberal in helping Nepal. Second, Nepal should also stop approaching China only when our relations with India sour. We have left this impression on the Chinese psyche. First, we should be clear about what exactly we want from China, forge consensus among major political forces and hold talks with the Chinese leaders. Then, we should be equally committed to implementing the agreements reached this way. People now take announcements of building big projects under Chinese support as propaganda. Therefore, this time the prime minister should stress on pushing the pending projects. The prime minister should tell them that even the projects announced during President Xi’s visit have not progressed and that has created a bad impression of China in Nepal.There are some differences between the coalition partners—the CPN-UML and the Nepali Congress—about the funding modality of projects under the Belt and Road Initiatives (BRI). Do you think this may cause a problem?The UML wants to expedite the BRI projects while the Congress has insisted that we should accept only grants and not loans under the BRI. The prime minister should clear such dilemmas and come up with common views before he leaves for Beijing. Once they come up with a common view on such key issues, it will give a positive and strong message. The Chinese side will take it more seriously because the strong government led by the two largest parties can implement bilateral agreements.We have instances of Nepal’s political parties standing for and against important projects funded by other countries. This was seen in the case of the US-funded Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), and China’s BRI. Moreover, in the past, the Chinese leaders created an impression that they preferred working with communist parties and leaders. This is neither in the interest of Nepal nor of China.There are also discussions on signing the BRI implementation plan during the visit. What are the things Nepal should be careful about while signing BRI-related agreements?Trying to get grants instead of loans is in itself good. But there is no need to be prejudiced against the BRI per se. Nepal reportedly wants to include some points specifying waivers in specific projects. We should be very careful while signing project-based agreements. For instance, what will be the conditions and funding modality of a project, will it be developed under grants or loans etcetera. All our technical experts and other brains should be engaged while signing project-based agreements and specifying conditions and other nitty-gritty to ensure that we will not have unnecessary liability and debt burden in the future. Over time, Nepal has rightly adopted a steadfast position saying that we don’t join a strategic alliance proposed by any country. It stayed away from the US government’s State Partnership Programme (SPP) and China’s Global Security Initiative (GSI) as well as from India’s security umbrella. But we can’t be isolated in development initiatives. We have to take support from India, China, the US and other countries based on our needs.Do you think the Chinese side will show magnanimity on Nepal’s requests, for instance on waiving off the loan to develop Pokhara international airport?Though the Chinese ambassador to Nepal last year claimed the airport project to be under the BRI, the case is different because it was signed years before we joined the BRI. And, converting that loan into a grant is not a big deal for China. They should show magnanimity given the support we have been providing to China for a long time. If you see things historically, Nepal has helped China by suppressing Khampa revolt, preventing free Tibet movements on our soil and showing a steadfast commitment to One-China policy. China, which is now prosperous, should definitely show magnanimity and waive off loan of Pokhara airport. They shouldn’t see relations with Nepal through a purely transactional lens.In your book, you describe 2008 as a watershed after which the engagements between Nepal and China increased drastically. But why couldn’t we benefit from the northern neighbour in terms of development?The Chinese side looks more interested in increasing engagement. They like to showcase their development before foreigners. But more than lavish hospitality, we need substantive support from the neighbour, which has emerged as the world’s second-largest economy. But we should be clear about what we want from our engagements with China.  The Nepali side doesn’t present its proposals clearly. On certain issues, our politicians give mixed signals. This time, if this government of two largest parties reaches a certain agreement with China and remains committed to implement it, other forces can’t hinder it. The same approach can be replicated while dealing with India, the US, Japan or other friendly countries.Is difficult geography still a barrier in developing cross-border infrastructure projects and deepening relations between Nepal and China?In our textbooks we read that the Himalayan range is a natural barrier between the two countries. In my book ‘Bhikshu Byapar ra Bidroha’, I have explored and described how people from Nepal and northern India had been traversing through these mountains and there were interactions and engagements between the people in this part of the world since the 5th and 6th centuries. So, the mountains weren’t barriers even at that time. Now technology has made things easier. We have to think about how to connect with these two big economies. We have multiple east-west highways. Now we need north-south highways connecting the three countries that will help us reap benefits from India and China.At present, relations between these two countries have improved and it is an opportunity for us. We have to forge understanding with both India and China if we have to materialise big projects based on trilateral agreement. One thing we can’t accept is the concept of two-plus-one (India, China plus Nepal). That is unacceptable because it downgrades Nepal to a junior partner. We need trilateral agreements to develop mega connectivity-related and other investment projects but such agreements should be made on an equal-footing between the three countries. \nOn Tuesday, the hilly regions of Koshi Province will experience partial cloud cover during the day, while other areas will remain mainly clear.
