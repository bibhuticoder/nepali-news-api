Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nBangladesh was thrown into turmoil on Monday after the army took charge following Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s resignation in the wake of violent anti-quota protests by students.The recent protests, which saw hundreds of students killed, prompted Hasina to leave the country in a hurry. She is learnt to have landed in neighbouring India’s Tripura state by an army helicopter, and is reportedly planning to move on to Europe. In a televised address to the nation following Hasina’s departure, Bangladeshi army chief General Waker-uz-Zaman announced the formation of a new interim government. The situation is a grim reminder of Sri Lanka in 2022, when protesters ousted the ruling Rajapaksha family from the country. Some social media users in Nepal suggested their homeland could face a similar situation due to mounting public frustration over the economic crisis, lack of jobs, and mass exodus of youths and students who seek opportunities abroad.The Nepali Embassy in Dhaka has issued an advisory for Nepalis staying in Bangladesh regarding their safety amid the ongoing unrest there.The Embassy released a notice on Monday requesting all Nepali nationals staying in Bangladesh to stay safe and secure in their current locations and take help from the embassy if they need repatriation.According to the embassy, currently, there are around 400 Nepalis in Bangladesh as most of the Nepalis there have already returned home earlier.Although the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not issued any statement on the unfolding situation in Bangladesh, a key partner in SAARC, BIMSTEC, and other regional and global forums, Nepal has issued “red alert” at some key border points in eastern Nepal. This precaution aims to prevent any spillover effect from Bangladesh’s unrest, including illegal border crossings and infiltration along the porous Nepal-India border.It is relatively easier for Bangladeshi nationals to enter Nepal via India through various districts in the Koshi Province.Many nationals from third countries have entered Nepal via India and sought shelter as ‘refugees’ here.Earlier, groups of Rohingyas illegally entered Nepal via the Mechi Bridge and other entry points, eventually reaching Kathmandu after the military coup in Myanmar. Similarly, following the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan, some Afghans entered Nepal as ‘refugees’ via India.A meeting of the central security committee headed by Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak was convened at the Home Ministry to discuss the latest situation in Bangladesh and the security along the Nepal-India border. After the meeting, according to home ministry officials, directives were issued to security forces in order to increase vigilance along the border. “We have issued a ‘red alert’ at the entry points mainly in eastern Nepal, and stepped up vigilance along the Nepal-India border due to the unfolding situation inside Bangladesh,” DIG Kumar Neupane, spokesperson of the Armed Police Force, told the Post.“We have increased our regular checks, boosted deployment, and tightened security at checkpoints, mostly in Koshi, Madhesh, and Lumbini provinces,” said Neupane. “We are also closely monitoring the situation across the Nepal-India border.”“From Ilam to Lumbini province, we have increased vigilance to stop any kind of illegal crossing besides that of Indian nationals,” he said. The Armed Police Force guarding the Nepal-India border has set up over 244 border outposts.Besides the Armed Police Force, the Ministry of Home Affairs has instructed other security agencies, such as the Nepal Police and National Intelligence Department, to increase vigilance and deployment along the Nepal-India border.Experts and diplomats have also expressed concerns about the unfolding situation in Bangladesh. “The government should speak up,” said Madhuraman Acharya, former foreign secretary and ambassador. “The unfolding situation in neighbouring Bangladesh is a matter of concern that the government of Nepal should keep a close watch on, and it should call for a speedy return to normalcy, peace, and order in that country in line with the wishes of the Bangladeshi people.” As chaos and unrest began in Bangladesh, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs asked Nepali students to stay safe and facilitated the return of those who wanted to return home via land and air.“The government of Nepal should formulate its position and call for the restoration of normalcy and peace in Bangladesh,” said Acharya.Some experts believe the emerging situation in Bangladesh will have ripple effects across South Asia, noting that the circumstances in Sri Lanka in 2022 and now in Bangladesh are totally different. While the events in Sri Lanka were fueled by an economic crisis, Bangladesh’s economy is one of the most robust in South Asia. But Hasina was accused of accumulating and misusing power. “The dramatic regime change in Bangladesh will reverberate through the region,” said Nischal Nath Pandey, director of Centre for South Asian Studies (CSAS). “Having a supermajority in parliament is not enough,” he noted.“Bad governance, impunity, massive corruption, self-centred leadership and cronyism can lead to youth disenchantment,” he said, adding that Nepali leadership should also learn from Bangladesh’s experience.“Good governance, corruption control, appointments based on merit, and understanding youth sentiments are key to political survival.” \nThe Meteorological Forecasting Division under the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology has issued a ‘heavy to very heavy’ rainfall warning for Tuesday and Wednesday.Issuing a ‘monsoon special bulletin’ on Monday morning, the Met Office said that the monsoon trough is positioned north of the average place in the east and south of the average place in the west, and this unusual positioning could lead to more intense rain. The monsoon trough is a low-pressure area that brings moisture-laden winds from the oceans and causes increased cloudiness and rains.“There is a chance of heavy to very heavy rainfall in some places of Koshi, Bagmati, Gandaki, Lumbini, and Sudurpaschim provinces and a few places of Karnali and Madhesh provinces,” reads the bulletin issued by the Met Office. “There is also a chance of extremely heavy rainfall in one or two places of Bagmati, Gandaki, and Lumbini provinces.”The Met Office warned of the risk of landslides, debris flow, and land erosion in the hills and risks of floods and inundation in urban areas and in the Tarai. Water levels in small and big rivers could rise, and daily life, agriculture, health, tourism, and land and air transportation could also be affected, according to the bulletin. The Met Office has asked the general public and all relevant agencies for precautions.This is the sixth special bulletin issued by the Met Office since the start of the monsoon on June 10.The monsoon season in Nepal generally begins on June 13 and ends on September 23. This year, the monsoon entered Nepal from the southwest on June 10, three days ahead of the usual onset date. Last year, it started on June 14, a day later than normal.This year, the division has forecast above-normal rains and above-average maximum and minimum temperatures this monsoon, which could unleash extreme weather events such as flooding, inundation, and landslides.Several districts have already reported incidents of landslides, flooding and lightning since the start of the monsoon season.According to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority, at least 150 people have died, and scores have been injured and missing in landslides, flood and lightning-related incidents since June 10.What do red, orange and yellow warnings signify?Red warning: According to Met officials, a red warning means looming extreme weather conditions. Excessive rainfall, floods, landslides, inundation, and others are likely to cause widespread damage. For the general public, it is a message to keep themselves and others safe from the extreme weather consequences and not to travel in risky zones. “Along with the general public, this is also an alert to all agencies concerned to gear up for response,” said Raju Pradhananga, a senior meteorologist.Red alerts have been issued for the districts of Taplejung, Panchthar, Sankhuwasabha, and Terhathum in the Koshi province; and Rasuwa, Chitwan, Nuwakot, Dhading, Sindhupalchok, and Dolakha in the Bagmati province. Likewise, Myagdi, Kaski, Baglung, Parbat, Syangja, Tanahun, Nawalparasi-East, Lamjung and Gorkha districts of the Gandaki province are also in the red zone. Similarly, red alerts have been issued for Kapilvastu, Rupandehi, Palpa, Gulmi, Nawalparasi-West, Dang, Banke, Bardia, Gulmi, Arghakhanchi of Lumbini province, as well as Kailali, Kanchanpur, Dadeldhura, Doti and Baitadi of the Sudurpaschim province.Orange warning: An orange warning also means moderate risks. Experts say severe situations due to extreme weather events are very likely in the said districts. For the general public, it is a message to make preparatory plans for potential emergencies. As the probability of extreme weather events is high, it is also a request not to travel in risky zones—landslide-prone roads and riverbanks, among others. According to Pradhananga, it is also a request to people to protect themselves and family members.The orange warning has been issued for the Okhaldhunga, Jhapa and Morang districts of the Koshi province; Siraha, Saptari and Dhanusha of Madhesh, and Ramechhap, Kathmandu and Bhaktapur of Bagmati. Orange warning has been also issued in Manang of the Gandaki province; Rukum-East and Rolpa of Lumbini, Dailekh, Surkhet, Salyan, Rukum-West, Jajarkot and Kalikot of the Karnali province; and Darchula and Achham of the Sudurpaschim province.Yellow warning: A yellow warning signifies serious consequences from extreme weather events, but its chances are very low. The bad weather conditions could disrupt daily lives. The yellow warning has been issued in Mustang, Dolpa, Mugu, Humla, Jumla, Bajura and Bajhang districts. \nIn Nepali Congress, the position of general secretary is considered the second most powerful after the party president.Historically, some charismatic leaders have held the position in the country’s grand old party: from Krishna Prasad Bhattarai in the 1950s, to Mahendra Narayan Nidhi, Girija Prasad Koirala, to now the duo of Gagan Thapa and Bishwa Prakash Sharma.When two relatively younger and popular leaders—Thapa and Sharma—got elected as general secretaries in December 2021, they had kindled hope among young Congress members and well-wishers of the party.But over time, they have failed to implement their agendas as the establishment led by party chief Deuba is dominant. Political analysts and observers, too, say that Thapa and Sharma have failed to reflect the strength of their popular mandate in the party decision making process.Prior to its 14th general convention, the party had the provision of one elected general secretary whereas the other was nominated by the party President after the general convention. In the last convention, the party amended its statute and made it mandatory to elect both the general secretaries and other party bearers through voting.With Thapa and Sharma elected as the Congress general secretaries, they were expected to challenge the septuagenarian party President Sher Bahadur Deuba.However, as a party insider claims, the general secretary duo themselves are struggling to create their space in party leadership. This struggle is a testament to the challenges they face in cementing their influence in the Congress, says a party leader.“The party’s general secretary is usually occupied with official work,” Prakash Sharan Mahat, a Congress spokesperson, told the Post. “How active they are in the party’s internal affairs is not something I can comment on.”After being elected as the party’s general secretaries, Thapa and Sharma have publicly spoken about being kept in the dark on vital matters. For instance, while speaking at the 42nd BP Memorial programme held on July 20, Thapa said the July 1 agreement between Congress and CPN-UML reached to form a new coalition government came as a surprise.Purushottam Dahal, a senior journalist close to the Congress, says the two general secretaries didn’t understand their exact role.“The general secretary’s role is to make the party’s central secretariat functional, but they are trying to be reactionary, which is inappropriate,” Dahal told the Post. “To make the party functional, they should not wait for a green signal from the party president.”However, General Secretary Sharma rubbishes such a claim.“There have been some transformative changes in the party after we assumed the role of general secretaries,” Sharma told the Post. “From establishing a library in the party’s central office to holding the BP Koirala Literature Festival, we have made the party more vibrant.”He argued that what has happened is that the duo have failed to publicise some of their important works.The general secretaries claim they are facing difficulties because of the party leadership’s working style, but some leaders don’t buy that argument.Sharma further claims that their work is often hindered by the generational gap with Deuba.“In addition, both of us general secretaries were elected from different panels during the general convention, which caused some misunderstanding among party leaders,” Sharma said.But there are other Congress leaders who accuse the general secretaries of suddenly turning risk-averse. “They are bound by the party statute as the party follows a presidential system where the president prevails over others,” Govinda Pokharel, a newly appointed head of the Economic Policy and Planning Department of the Congress, told the Post. “However, the two general secretaries cannot accommodate all groups in the party, and hence their difficulties.” According to Pokharel, after becoming the party’s office bearers, they are slowly turning cautious. “Although they have a very popular base and they also have content-based knowledge on development, they are not being able to use their potential.” Sharma differs.“We have challenged the party leadership on many issues to establish our agenda,” Sharma said. “At the party’s Mahasamiti meeting in February, we successfully proposed contesting the upcoming election with the party’s own strength… The party's central committee meeting, which will commence on Wednesday, will pass our proposal as it is.” A Congress leader close to General Secretary Thapa, however, acknowledged that Thapa is sometimes clueless about the party’s functioning.“From the beginning, the general secretaries have not been able to mobilise the leaders in their fold effectively,” Shankar Tiwari, a Congress youth leader close to Thapa, told the Post. “Sometimes they prevail over the party president, but on many other occasions they are also at his mercy.”Meanwhile, a few Congress leaders claim that the popularity of the general secretaries duo is diminishing, which could make it difficult for them to elevate themselves in party politics in the coming days. There are ample examples where Congress leaders lost their revolutionary spirit after becoming general secretary, says the leader.Only three past general secretaries of Congress have succeeded in becoming party chief and the prime minister. Krishna Prasad Bhattarai was the general secretary of the party soon after the establishment of democracy in Nepal in 1950. Likewise, Girija Prasad Koirala, another general secretary during the 1990s, later became the prime minister as well as the party President. Sushil Koirala was the third general secretary to become party president, and the prime minister. Jagat Nepal, a long-time Congress observer, says that apart from the prime minister, two of the Congress’s general secretaries have become the country’s President, if not party president and prime minister. “Ram Baran Yadav, the first President of the country, and Ramchandra Paudel, the current President, both were once the party’s general secretary,” Nepal told the Post. Besides, Taranath Ranabhat, the former general secretary of the party, and Paudel became Speakers of the House of Representatives in the 1990s.Nepal added that despite not being elevated to the party’s top position, a few former general secretaries of Congress had played an important role in national politics. “We can’t draw a sweeping conclusion that leaders lose their influence after becoming general secretary,” he said.Apart from the leaders mentioned above, Mahendra Narayan Nidhi, Krishna Prasad Sitaula, Prakash Man Singh, Sashank Koirala, and Purna Bahadur Khadka were the few among others who took up the responsibility of the general secretary.“As far as why they were not able to lift themselves to the top position is concerned, sometimes, despite their personal efficiency, circumstances might not be favourable,” Dahal, the senior journalist, said.General Secretary Sharma echoes Dahal.In the past, the party president used to nominate one of the two general secretaries. In such a case, the nominated general secretary would obviously not be able to challenge the party chief, Sharma said. From the 14th general convention, the party started to elect both general secretaries through voting by party delegates. \nNepal national women’s volleyball team defeated the Maldives in straight sets in their final group match of the CAVA Women’s Volleyball Nations League on Sunday, setting up a semi-final showdown against a strong Iran.Nepal, who were already assured of a semi-final spot, won against winless Maldives 25-8, 25-19, 25-18 at the National Sports Council’s covered hall in Tripureshwar, Kathmandu.The outcome means Nepal finished their league stage in second position with nine points from four matches, which included three wins and one loss.Aruna Shahi’s team’s only loss in the tournament so far came against Iran on Saturday, which prevented them from topping India in the group.The Indians defeated Sri Lanka 25-13, 25-21, 25-20 that gave them 10 points from four matches.The winners of the group stage face the fourth-placed team in the last four, while the second-placed team battle against the third-placed team.It means Nepal will clash against strong Iran in the semis but it will also be an opportunity for the home side to avenge the group stage loss.Shahi, whose team are still fresh from their historic first ever victory over India on Friday, said Nepal could overpower Iran in the final four but will have to make some improvements.“We need to tighten our receiving and defence. If we do that, we could beat Iran,” said Shahi during the post match conference after defeating the Maldives.“We also made many minor mistakes that cost us the game on Saturday. We will need to work on that as well.”India face Sri Lanka, who finished in the fourth position with four points.Both semi-final matches will take place on Tuesday. \nFor the past five days, every TV screen in Nepal has been displaying a message: Dear customers, due to a sudden and unforeseen problem with the channel distributor, international channels like Sony, Star, Zee, and Icast are currently unavailable.” Cable and internet TV operators have apologised for the disruption and assured that they would resolve the matter. Consumer rights activists say that consumers are being cheated under various pretexts.Nepali operators say that delays in approving the à la carte pricing guidelines by the Finance Ministry led the Indian broadcaster to cut some channels from cable and internet TV services last Thursday evening. “As the dues piled up due to the delays by the government in giving approval to the pricing guidelines, the Indian Broadcasting and Digital Foundation decided to cut channel services in Nepal,” said Sudhir Parajuli, president of the Federation of Nepal Cable Television Association.The Indian Broadcasting and Digital Foundation is a unified representative body of TV broadcasters and over-the-top platforms in India. Over-the-top platforms are streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, among others, that deliver content over the internet directly to viewers.Before the à la carte system, broadcasters and distributors would reach an agreement and sign a contract that included pricing details, said Parajuli. “With the implementation of the à la carte system, new pricing guidelines were required.”In August last year, the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology formally implemented the “pick-and-pay” option for Nepali television viewers.“Since the Indian broadcasters were initially not ready to adopt the à la carte system, we were also in a dilemma. Eventually, the government strictly enforced the system.”The Ministry of Communications then prepared and sent the tariff guidelines to the Ministry of Finance. “It took a while for the Ministry of Finance to give its approval,” said Parajuli.The Ministry of Finance finally gave its approval to the guidelines last Thursday and sent them to the Ministry of Communications, said Parajuli.“The distributors have not been able to pay the Indian broadcasters for the last 14 months. The outstanding dues amount to Rs500 million,” Parajuli said. The Ministry of Communications could not issue foreign exchange recommendations for distributors to pay their Indian vendors because the guidelines had been stalled.“Now that the guidelines have been approved, services will resume within a few days,” Parajuli said.Government officials claimed they were unaware of the issue.The secretary at the Ministry of Communications, Radhika Aryal, said she was unaware of the issue because she had been newly appointed to the ministry.The Post's multiple attempts to reach the ministry spokesperson Gajendra Thakur were unsuccessful.Officials from the Department of Information and Broadcasting, also said they were unaware of the issue.The à la carte system allows viewers to choose and pay only for the channels they want to watch. This allows viewers to watch their favourite channels and pay only for those, rather than the whole package that includes channels they rarely watch. The Ministry of Communications has fixed a minimum monthly fee of Rs250 per customer for cable television to cover carrying costs.This model is used in countries like India, the United States, and Canada.According to the federation, there are eight cable TV operators, including internet TV providers in Nepal. Around 110 Nepali channels and 98 foreign channels are broadcast in Nepal, serving around 1.5 million subscribers who have renewed their subscriptions. Service providers pay monthly fees to both the distributor and to the Indian broadcasters. “We have been paying the distributor every month, but the distributor has not received foreign exchange approvals from the Ministry of Communications,” said Parajuli.According to the federation, the Indian broadcaster has suspended all packages from Zee, Sony, Colours, and Star across the country. If some customers still have access to these channels, then it must be pirated.Currently, TV channels in Nepal are broadcast through direct-to-home, multiple-system operators, multichannel multipoint distribution services, internet protocol television, and digital terrestrial television, among other methods.“Customers pay in advance for cable TV services, but the service has been interrupted for five days, and there is no sign of resumption. This is a total scam,” said Prem Lal Maharjan, president of the National Consumers Forum.“Who is responsible for this, and who will compensate for this?” He demanded that the service providers compensate the customers for the disruption. \nBangladesh’s army chief will meet student protest leaders on Tuesday as the country awaits the formation of a new government a day after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled following a violent uprising against her that killed hundreds.Student leaders, who spearheaded a movement against job quotas that turned into a call for Hasina to resign, said early on Tuesday that they want a new interim government with Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus as its chief adviser.“Any government other than the one we recommended would not be accepted,” Nahid Islam, one of the key organisers of the student movement, said in a video on Facebook with three other organisers. “We wouldn’t accept any army-supported or army-led government.”“We have also had discussions with Muhammad Yunus and he has agreed to take on this responsibility at our invitation,” Islam added.Yunus, 84, and his Grameen Bank won the 2006 Nobel Peace prize for work to lift millions out of poverty by granting tiny loans of under $100 to the rural poor of Bangladesh but he was indicted by a court in June on charges of embezzlement that he denied.Yunus did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Bangladesh Army Chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman plans to meet the protest organisers at 12 noon local time (0600 GMT) on Tuesday, the army said in a statement, a day after Zaman announced Hasina’s resignation in a televised address and said an interim government would be formed.Zaman said he had held talks with leaders of major political parties - excluding Hasina’s long-ruling Awami League - to discuss the way ahead and was due to hold talks with the president Mohammed Shahabuddin .An interim government will hold elections as soon as possible after consulting all parties and stakeholders, President Shahabuddin said in a televised address late on Monday.He also said that it was “unanimously decided” to immediately release the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) chairperson and Hasina’s nemesis, Begum Khaleda Zia, who was convicted in a graft case in 2018 but moved to a hospital a year later as her health deteriorated. She has denied the charges against her.A BNP spokesperson said on Monday that Zia, 78, was in hospital and “will clear all charges legally and come out soon”.Hasina, 76, had ruled since winning a decades-long power struggle with Zia in 2009. She landed at a military airfield, Hindon, near Delhi on Monday after leaving Dhaka, two Indian government officials told Reuters, adding that India’s National Security Adviser Ajit Doval met her there.They did not elaborate on her stay or plans. The Indian Express newspaper reported that Hasina was taken to a “safe house” and she was likely to travel to the United Kingdom. Reuters could not immediately verify the report. \nThe ripples of Nepal’s political instability are far-reaching, extending beyond its border. Soon after a government falls and a new prime minister assumes office, provincial leaders are toppled, senior bureaucrats are transferred, and ministers are changed—and so are the ambassadors. Little do our leaders seem to care how detrimental the coming and going of envoys is for the country’s image. The new coalition government headed by KP Oli has recently finalised the names of 19 envoys to serve in different capitals. The ambassadors appointed by the previous coalition under Pushpa Kamal Dahal were recalled. Only time will tell the fate of the new appointees, as we cannot say how long the incumbent government will last. Recalling envoys en masse every time there is a government change is not conducive for a country like Nepal that is having to maintain an increasingly difficult balance between major powers like India, China and the US. Ambassadors, when appointed to a new place, need some time to familiarise themselves with their new environment. But if they are replaced no sooner than they are appointed, the very purpose of diplomacy is lost. Half of Nepal’s ambassadors are political appointees and the rest are career diplomats. The political appointments in particular are problematic. Krishna Prasad Oli, a close associate of the prime minister, has been picked as the ambassador to China. (His main coalition partner, Sher Bahadur Deuba, the Nepali Congress chief, also undoubtedly got to have his say in other picks.) Oli’s envoys are predominantly so-called upper-caste men, with only four women and not a single Dalit ambassador nominee. There also seems to be little forethought on when and when not to recall ambassadors. Take the case of Shankar Sharma, Nepal’s former ambassador to India. Appointed by Deuba in March 2022 when he was in a coalition with Dahal, Sharma was recalled when Dahal allied with Oli to form a new government back in March this year. He has been reappointed after coming to power of the UML-Congress coalition. This kind of immature diplomacy with a country as important as India will do great harm to Nepal’s interests. Experts have suggested increasing the proportion of career diplomats as ambassadors from the current 50 percent to 80 or 90 percent. That will apparently decrease political meddling in the process. Perhaps an even better idea is to pick ambassadors, at least to important capitals like New Delhi, Beijing and Washington DC, on the basis of broad political understanding. After all, even if there is a change in government, a combination of the same two or three parties will come to power. If that is the case, why not make these picks judiciously through political consultations and let the ambassadors work for their full four-year term? That would also be in keeping with our national interest. One thing that can be done to ensure that the right people are picked is to make the nominees undergo a rigorous parliamentary vetting process. Up until now, such hearings for ambassador picks have been no more than rituals. But as we recently saw in the case of Krishna Man Pradhan, someone charged with sexual exploitation who was nominated as election commissioner, the parliamentary hearing process can be quite effective in keeping out the bad eggs. Again, in these testing times around the world for international relations and diplomacy, Nepal cannot afford to continue with its current ad hoc approach. \nThe Gurung villagers, including some women, assaulted a Dalit man and his mother at their home in the Gurkha village of Lwang, Machhapuchhre Rural Municipality, Kaski, on Friday night. They also broke windows and shouted casteist slurs as well as demeaning remarks. The Dalit victims survived the unprovoked attack, but the single mother required treatment in intensive care at a hospital in Pokhara. Someone bravely took a video of the brutality on their mobile and uploaded it to a YouTube channel. That’s how the terrible crime came to public notice. I learnt from both the video reporting and community members that the local police have refused to register the case as an attempted murder motivated by caste hatred. The local authorities have bent on protecting the accused, their caste fellows, from legal action. This case shows how Dalits continue to suffer mental and physical violence at the hands of ethnic or tribal groups as well. Upper castes are generally blamed for committing crimes against Dalits, but it is not exclusive to them. I suggest that the incident can also be a window into the rather perplexing question of why ethnic groups like the Gurung, Magar, Rai and Limbu continue to segregate and dominate Dalits, even though their movements have vociferously denounced caste hierarchy and distanced themselves from Hindu customs and cultures for decades.Criminals of historyIn a recent Kathmandu gathering hosted by the newly established “Front for Identity” (opened two months ago under the leadership of Mahendra Lawoti, professor of political science at Western Michigan University, USA), Gopal Kirati, veteran leader of ethnic communities and former minister from the Maoist party, made an interesting self-reflexive remark. He said, “I’m a criminal of history. Growing up, I learnt nothing from this society and culture except how to treat Dalits worse than animals.” I wish more ethnic leaders and activists came forward like Kirati and acknowledged their and their communities’ ill-treatment of those considered lower or less pure than themselves. The fact that they continue to humiliate and attack Dalits even now should deeply concern them. It’s also time they realised their grave mistake of excluding Dalits from their movements, which peaked in the late 1990s and included them in their fight against Brahmanism. Dalits themselves recognise many differences between their issues and those of ethnic minorities; however, in reality, there are many overlaps. For one thing, in the eyes of the so-called high-caste Hindu, even ethnic minorities are low-caste Shudra; they, too, are denied the sacred thread and treated as untouchable. Upper castes, mainly orthodox Hindus, don’t accept rice prepared by members of ethnic communities. High castes wouldn’t normally marry ethnic minorities, and even if they did, the latter would face certain restrictions, mainly in the religious and spiritual sphere. An ethnic woman married to an upper caste may be barred from worshipping the lineage deities, for example.Not to mention, thanks to the extensive Hinduisation of ethnic groups over the years, there’s a degree of caste hierarchy practised within and amongst those communities as well. The Gurung wouldn’t marry a Tamang, for example, as the latter has been placed only slightly above the Dalit on the scale of ritual pollution. If the ethnic activists had brought Dalits on board—or at least forged a strong alliance with them—their movements would have become larger and stronger. In the meantime, their populace would probably have been educated about the fallacy and inhumanity associated with the Dalit exclusion. Members of ethnic communities would have learnt that the rejection of caste hierarchy also implies the termination of ritual hierarchy altogether. Thus, the behaviour of these ethnic groups towards Dalits would have hopefully changed quite drastically by now. Ethnic leaders and activists not only excluded Dalits from their movements but also didn’t talk about ending untouchability. They were keen on toppling the Bahun hegemony and separating and suppressing the Dalits. This has been a big failure of ethnic and indigenous identity politics so far. Proponents of ethnic identity should now see this drawback, as Gopal Kiranti seems to have done, and try to bring Dalits along with them. The Front for Identity, led by Prof Lawoti, appears keen to move in this direction. Identity: Horizontal versus vertical In a highly caste-ridden society like ours, the issues of collective identity and individual freedom seem conflicting. Ethnic politics does reify and solidify group boundaries. Ethnic groups are eager to highlight and bolster those inter-group boundaries, whereas Dalits want to dissolve those boundaries once and for all. How do we conceptually overcome this apparent mismatch?Notably, ethnic groups are horizontally arranged—long-term Hinduisation and caste-ification notwithstanding. They are culturally separate but, by and large, equal in status hierarchy. There’s much equality in how these groups interact with each other. Ethnic activists are keen to preserve and promote this horizontal separation.This doesn’t necessarily hurt Dalits’ quest for equality because they want to dismantle the vertical hierarchy and arrange themselves horizontally. They don’t want the statuses to be conceived as big and small, high and low, top and bottom, pure and impure. This explains why many Dalits hate the caste system while loving their caste identities. Dalit caste associations aren’t as big and influential as ethnic associations, yet they have been an important part of the Dalit movement for decades.Once people understand the difference between these two sets of identities arranged horizontally and vertically, the ethnic and Dalit movements can coalesce. This way, ethnic and Dalit campaigners can find common ground and struggle together. This should be the new way forward to accelerate societal change. The recent case of caste violence sheds light on the fact that caste discrimination is rampant within ethnic minority communities, too. They may resent the Hindu social hierarchy in terms of Bahun supremacy, but they are eager to continue suppressing Dalits. My past research and experience show that ethnic communities have played a big role in dominating Dalits, sometimes worse than upper castes! Things should change now, and activists from the new generation must be the active agents of that important change. If you really want to shake the social structure, don’t just fix the ones above you. Consider the plight of those below you. It’s basically the same principle and practice. If you want to challenge Brahmanic supremacy, get rid of your own supremacy as well. Charity begins at home, and so does change!  \nPakistan’s human rights battles are now playing out across its digital landscape. The X ban drags on, fantasies of data localisation persist, and talk of further social media regulation is circulating. The state says it is indigenising internet infrastructure and better securing the nation. Digital and human rights activists are bracing for more censorship and targeted surveillance. In all scenarios, there is a risk that digital developments exacerbate gender inequality.This is the key warning of a new report from Amnesty International on Gender and Human Rights in a Digital Age. The wider deployment of technology—whether for good or evil—brings with it risks of what Amnesty refers to as tech-facilitated gender-based violence. Both Pakistan’s authoritarians and activists should ensure that digital deployments do not exacerbate gender discrimination in our country.Talk of tech is by default optimistic, and marginalised groups have overall benefited from digital technology, whether through finding online communities of like-minded souls or accessing information and services previously denied to them. The greatest threat to this digital empowerment remains access: Pakistan’s digital gender gap is severe, with 26 percent of women accessing the internet as compared to 47pc of men.While internet infrastructure is often posited as the solution to access gaps, the Amnesty report emphasises that the persistence of patriarchal structures in the digital realm means that discrimination endures even where infrastructure becomes available. One reason for this is the datafication of our lives. To exist in the 21st century, you need a data profile. And this profile is born from digital identity cards, online credit histories, e-bills to physical addresses, and yes, unfettered internet access. These are all things routinely denied to marginalised groups, particularly women, in the offline world. Any new digital regulation that prioritises security considerations over inclusion would be doing a disservice to the Pakistani people.Data collection is also inherently discriminatory. The approach is often rooted in existing structural inequality, rendering marginalised groups invisible online as well. The Amnesty report points to digital identity systems as a key example of this. Think of our own national identity cards that require identification in the context of patriarchal family structures. Nadra is specifically called out in the report for deciding in 2023 to temporarily suspend the option for individuals to identify as ‘X’ in the gender category, leaving many transgender people without digital identification and so without access to other social services.Of course, with more inclusive data profiles comes a greater need for data protection and privacy. For marginalised groups, datafication also means enhanced vulnerability. Such groups may go online to access information or services that are sensitive or stigmatised (for example, information about reproductive health). The ability to freely access and share information and services without fear of surveillance should be respected as a core human right.There is also a gendered aspect to the economic opportunities that digitisation offers. The Pakistani debate on technology has become entirely securitised. But digital access is also about finding jobs in the gig economy, availing the benefits of digital entrepreneurship and ensuring that contract workers are fairly compensated by non-transparent algorithms. In all these arenas, women are at higher risk of reduced access to opportunity, discriminatory wages and oppressive workplace surveillance. Indeed, Amnesty argu­­es that tech-fa­c­­­­ilitated gender discrimination is likely to worsen gende­red poverty worldwide.Once online, women are also more vulnerable to online harassment. In a 2022 HRCP report Rethinking the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, Farieha Aziz highlights how Peca has failed to protect women. Not only has the law failed to deter against online harassment, but it has also, she argues, exacerbated patriarchal oppression through its implementation. She documents how women who have sought justice under Peca have, instead, been subjected to additional offline harassment and intimidation by FIA officials, humiliation by lawyers, and retaliatory defamation charges. Such gender-based harassment should be the real security concern.Sadly, women will also increasingly bear the brunt of state efforts to control the digital realm. This will be due to a vicious cycle in which women will turn to feminist activism or political protest to defend their rights, and then find those rights further trampled through digital surveillance and censorship. Pakistani women have it hard enough; digital technology should not set them back further.-Dawn (Pakistan)/ANN \nGeneral elections give the political parties the only real chance to test their popularity. What we have seen in the recent past is a clear preference of Nepal’s major forces for pre-poll alliances. With the country’s mixed electoral system unlikely to give any single party an absolute majority and thus a shot at forming the government on its own, what is the harm in jointly contesting elections with other parties? That, at least, is the argument of the proponents of such pre-election tie-ups. But in reality such pre-poll alliances smack of an utter lack of confidence and conviction. Nepali parties detest being in the opposition’s bench; there is no political culture of smaller parties accepting their limited mandate and waiting for the next five years for another shot at governing. So it makes sense for them to try to ensure, even before people head to the polls, to maximise their chances of being on the right side of the parliament’s aisle. What is more, such pre-poll alliances often come with the added bonus of safe seats for top leaders. But with parties professing vastly different ideologies standing on the same platform, the only message people get is that the country’s top parties are interested less in good governance and delivery than getting to power for its own sake. But lo and behold! All three of the country’s major parties—the Nepali Congress, the CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre)—have now publicly committed to single-handedly contest the 2027 general elections. That, we are afraid, is an unlikely prospect. The Maoist Centre, the latest of the Big Three to make such a declaration, could be wiped out at the next polls without other parties’ help. Pushpa Kamal Dahal, someone who has been at the party’s helm for 35 years—and by extension his Maoist Centre party—has lost all credibility with his pendulum-like political swings. The party, which once championed the causes of the marginalised and the downtrodden, is these days an ardent backer of the kind of crony capitalism it used to accuse the Congress and the UML of fostering. In the past elections, the Maoist Centre has allied with both the parties, to limited success. The benefits of such pre-poll alliances for the two biggest parties is questionable, too. It thus makes sense for these parties, including the Maoist Centre, to test their individual strength in upcoming elections. Despite the short-term risks, that would be the right thing to do, for the individual interests of these parties and for the larger good of Nepali democracy. People today are confused as they have no clear options at elections, and many of them choose not to vote. If instead the ballot papers reflect a clear choice between competing ideologies and agendas, it’s a whole new ballgame. The electorate can then make informed choices. For the political parties, the general elections offer a rare chance to test the strength of their programmes and leaders. Why lose this golden opportunity to do so and adapt accordingly for long-term success? Once individual parties know their real electoral strength, they can always join hands with other parties to form federal and provincial governments. Their public positions notwithstanding, do our political parties and their leaders have the self-belief to take the poll-plunge alone? People doubt it. But they will be happy to be proven wrong.   \nFormer Constituent Assembly member and senior industrialist Shrawan Kumar Agrawal passed away on Monday. He was 77.Agrawal, the former chair of the Marwadi Sewa Samiti, breathed his last at his residence in Sanepa.He was the father of Rajesh Kumar Agrawal, the president of the Confederation of Nepalese Industries (CNI).The CNI issued a condolence statement today, paying tribute to him.The late Agrawal had been leading various industries for the past 58 years. He is survived by his wife, two sons, and one daughter. He will be cremated at Pashupati Aryaghat today, according to the statement. \nAt least five US personnel were injured in an attack against a military base in Iraq on Monday, US officials told Reuters, as the Middle East braced for a possible new wave of attacks by Iran and its allies following last week’s killing of senior members of militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah.Two Katyusha rockets were fired at al Asad airbase in western Iraq, two Iraqi security sources said. One Iraqi security source said the rockets fell inside the base. It was unclear whether the attack was linked to threats by Iran to retaliate over the killing of the Hamas leader.The US officials, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said one of the wounded Americans was seriously injured. The casualty count was based on initial reports which could still change, they said.“Base personnel are conducting a post-attack damage assessment,” one of the officials added.Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, was assassinated in the Iranian capital Tehran last week, an attack that drew threats of revenge by Iran on Israel. Iran blamed Israel for the killing, but Israel has not claimed responsibility.Coupled with the killing of the senior military commander of the Lebanese group Hezbollah, Fuad Shukr, by Israel in a strike on Beirut last week, the killings have fuelled concern the conflict in Gaza was turning into a wider Middle East war.Iran has said the US bears responsibility in the assassination of Haniyeh because of its support for Israel.In a call on Monday, US. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant agreed that the attack marked “a dangerous escalation,” according to a Pentagon readout.Last week the US. carried out a strike in Iraq against individuals US. officials said were militants getting ready to launch drones and posed a threat to US. and coalition forces.The US. has been watching to see if Iran would make good on its vow to respond to the killing of Haniyeh two days ago in Tehran, one in a series of killings of senior figures in the Palestinian militant group as the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza rages.The Pentagon has said it will deploy additional fighter jets and Navy warships to the Middle East, as Washington seeks to bolster defenses following threats from Iran and its allies Hamas and Hezbollah.A rare ally of both the US. and Iran, Iraq hosts 2,500 US. troops and has Iran-backed militias linked to its security forces. It has witnessed escalating tit-for-tat attacks since the Israel-Hamas war erupted in October.Iraq wants troops from the US.-led military coalition to begin withdrawing in September and to formally end the coalition’s work by September 2025, Iraqi sources have said, with some US. forces likely to remain in a newly negotiated advisory capacity.Baghdad has struggled to reign in Iran-backed armed groups that have attacked US. forces there and in neighboring Syria dozens of time since Oct. 7.Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani spoke with US. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken on Sunday.An Iraqi official said Blinken asked Sudani to help decrease regional tensions by helping to convince Iran to temper its response to what it says was an Israeli strike in Tehran that killed the leader of Hamas last week. US. Army General Michael “Erik” Kurilla, head of US. Central Command, is currently in the Middle East. One of the US. officials said Kurilla was speaking with allies to ensure there was coordination in case of an Iranian attack against Israel. \nOn Tuesday, the weather will be generally cloudy across the country, with light to moderate rain accompanied by thunder and lightning expected in many areas of all provinces. The Meteorological Forecasting Division said there is a possibility of heavy rainfall at one or two locations in the Koshi, Madhesh, Bagmati, Gandaki, Lumbini, and Sudurpaschim provinces.Additionally, heavy to very heavy rainfall may occur at one or two spots in Koshi, Bagmati, Gandaki, and Lumbini provinces.Tonight, cloudy conditions will persist nationwide, with light to moderate rain and thunderstorms anticipated in many areas across all provinces. Heavy to very heavy rainfall may affect a few locations in the remaining provinces, while very heavy to extremely heavy rainfall is possible at one or two sites in Bagmati, Gandaki, and Lumbini provinces.Meteorological analysis indicates that monsoon winds are affecting the country, with the monsoon trough positioned to the north of the average location.On Tuesday, the highest temperature recorded was 38.4 degrees Celsius in Janakpur, while the lowest temperature was 15 degrees Celsius in Jomsom.In terms of rainfall, Ghorahi received the highest amount at 53.6 mm, followed by Dadeldhura with 30.1 mm. Other notable rainfall figures include Pokhara with 10.3 mm and Jiri with 8.6 mm. Some areas, such as Dipayal, Birendranagar, and Simara, reported no rainfall during this period. \nUnited States has been urging other countries through diplomatic channels to tell Iran that escalation in the Middle East is not in their interest, a State Department spokesperson said on Monday, at what Secretary of State Antony Blinken called a “critical moment” for the region.Blinken said Washington was “engaged in intense diplomacy, pretty much around the clock” to help calm tensions amid fears Iran is preparing a retaliatory strike against Israel.“All parties must refrain from escalation,” Blinken said during a signing ceremony with his Australian counterpart in Washington.“All parties must take steps to ease tensions. Escalation is not in anyone’s interests. It will only lead to more conflict, more violence, more insecurity.”Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in the Iranian capital Tehran last week, an attack that drew threats of revenge on Israel and fueled further concern that the conflict in Gaza was turning into a wider Middle East war.Iran has blamed Israel and said it will “punish” it; Israeli officials have not claimed responsibility for the killing. Iran backs Hamas, which is at war with Israel in Gaza, and also the Lebanese group Hezbollah, whose senior military commander Fuad Shukr was killed in an Israeli strike on Beirut last week.US President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were briefed by their national security team on the situation in the Middle East, including threats posed by Iran and its proxies to Israel and US servicemembers, the White House said. They were also briefed about an attack on Iraq’s al Asad airbase on Monday and discussed the US response.During that briefing, Biden and Harris were told by their national security team that it is still unclear when Iran and Hezbollah are likely to launch an attack against Israel “and the specifics of such an attack,” according to a US official.At least five US personnel were wounded in the rocket strike, US officials told Reuters. It was unclear whether the attack was linked to threats by Iran to retaliate over Haniyeh’s killing, in which the US said it had no involvement.Biden and Harris were also updated on US efforts to support Israel militarily if it is attacked and diplomatic efforts to “de-escalate regional tension” and reach a ceasefire and hostage-release deal in Gaza.Blinken earlier on Monday spoke with Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani and Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty.“One of the points of the engagements that we have had is to urge countries to pass messages to Iran and urge countries to make clear to Iran that it is very much not in their interests to escalate this conflict, that it is very much not in their interest to launch another attack on Israel,” said State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller.Miller, speaking at a press briefing, did not say definitively whether or not Washington’s messages have been disseminated to Iran or through which channel.“I would expect that some of them would pass that message along and impress that point upon the government of Iran,” he added.Blinken in his remarks also called for parties to “break this cycle” of violence and agree a ceasefire in the Gaza conflict, despite the killing of Haniyeh, who was a key figure in the negotiations between Israel and Hamas.“What it comes down to really is all parties finding ways to come to an agreement, not look for reasons to delay or to say no,” Blinken said. “It is urgent that all parties make the right choices in the hours and days ahead.” \nDue to civil unrest in Bangladesh, Nepal has increased security at its India-Nepal border to prevent illegal entry from third countries, including refugees fleeing the country.\nSheikh Hasina, Bangladesh's Prime Minister, fled Dhaka amid widespread protests, seeking safe passage in India, while an interim government is being formed.\nBreakthroughs have been achieved on four tunnels of the Kathmandu-Tarai Expressway, including beidended twin-tube tunnels at Dhedre and Lendanda.\nNepali Embassy issues safety advisory for Nepalis in Bangladesh amidst unrest, advising caution and offering repatriation assistance.\nIn Nepal's 2,000-year-old Kumari tradition, young girls are worshipped as goddesses, with Matina Shakya serving as the Kumari of Kathmandu from 2008-2017 before being succeeded by Trishna Shakya, with the tradition evolving to provide better education and support for Kumaris.\nMost economists believe spending on infrastructure has a significant multiplier effect. During the construction phase, infrastructure generates real cash flow for workers and their families. In the long run, it has a direct and indirect impact on the economy, with a multiplier effect, particularly in job creation.In Rupandehi, which hosts the industrial city Bhairahawa, and Lumbini, a landmark of the Buddhist world listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1997, infrastructure built with a sizeable investment has gone to waste.Big infrastructure projects like the international convention centre, meditation centre, industrial zones, and Gautam Buddha International Airport have failed to generate income and have turned into veritable white elephants.Nature has started reclaiming most of the under-utilised infrastructure.Since 2010, talk of building an international airport led to the construction of large-scale infrastructure, including a bevy of luxury hotels.Proliferating factories and a rapidly spreading transport network turned the Butwal-Bhairahawa metroplex into an economic powerhouse.Nepal opened its second international airport in May 2022 in the southern city of Bhairahawa, but no international flight stops there right now.The objective of building an international airport in Bhairahawa was to bring in more tourists, energise businesses and create jobs. But the situation is just the opposite. Traders are closing down their shops and moving abroad for decent jobs.The private sector, too, invested heavily. When the finished project started to sit idle, it hit the sector, and many enterprises were teetering into bankruptcy.Economists term this development in Lumbini a cascading failure—a breakdown in a system of interconnected parts in which the failure of one or few parts leads to the failure of other parts. Hem Raj Regmi, deputy chief statistician and data curator at the National Statistics Office, said Lumbini province saw heavy investment from the government and the private sector, but the output has slowed. “Enterprises are unable to raise even the operating cost.”In the last fiscal year, Lumbini province was estimated to grow at 4.05 percent to a GDP of Rs814 billion, from the low base of the 1.99 percent growth it had achieved in the previous fiscal year. Lumbini is estimated to contribute 14.26 percent to the national GDP. The highest value-added growth rate in Lumbini was in electricity and gas, which grew by 28.93 percent, while the manufacturing sector was estimated to shrink by a negative 1.43 percent in the last fiscal year.Most completed infrastructures in Lumbini have become white elephants, as their expenditures have been growing instead of them generating income. The Butwal International Convention Center, built with an investment of Rs1.11 billion in ward 10 of Butwal Sub Metropolis, is currently without business. The centre has 13 halls, each with a capacity to accommodate 2,700 people. The auditorium is the largest of the 13.The government built the convention centre to organise national and international conferences and events, but it is not generating much income. Construction started in 2014 and the centre was inaugurated in August 2022.Officials say that the centre is struggling to pay its staff. While the centre is under-utilised and lacks maintenance, bushes have grown around it.Dharmendra Panthi, chief of the Butwal International Convention Center project, said 22 events or functions have been conducted in the past three years, earning Rs4 million. The centre is currently closed as the provincial cabinet is yet to pass the operating guidelines even in three years.However, Panthi said they have been occasionally renting the hall on request. The centre charges Rs96,000 for a day-long event.Prabin Pathak, president of the Nepal Hoteliers Association, who took part in a recent function at the convention centre, said the infrastructure is in a sorry state due to lack of periodic maintenance.“If the building is not utilised properly, it will be a waste of tax money,” said Pathak. “The washroom faucets are dry, and it is difficult to sit in the hall due to the stench from the washroom.”“In Nepal, there is a growing trend of building new infrastructure, but their upkeep is often ignored. This is sad,” Pathak said. “No one is accountable for the losses the projects incur. Similarly, questions are raised about the quality of construction. In most projects, low-quality materials are used, severely compromising the structural integrity.”A hall with a capacity to accommodate 5,000 people built near the Buddha’s birthplace, Lumbini, has yet to do any business, except hosting a few functions. It was built with an investment of Rs720 million.Sanuraja Shakya, member-secretary of the Lumbini Development Trust, said that if a social organisation wants to conduct a function at the centre, they have to pay a fee.Shakya said that since it is a meditation centre, they do not allow other functions, especially those involving entertainment.Questions were raised about the construction when the roof started leaking soon after project’s completion. It was repaired later.Likewise, the Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in Bhairahawa, has not been fully operational for a long time. As factories have not been set up in the SEZ, the area has turned into a jungle. Construction of the SEZ had started in 2003 and it was inaugurated in 2014.Located in south-central Nepal, the Bhairahawa Special Economic Zone has 69 industrial plots of sizes from 1,400 to 3,700 square metres. A few industrialists have booked plots, but have not set up their plants as the government has failed to provide pledged services and amenities. The government had promised to provide 24-hour electricity, a one-stop service system, customs, banks, and insurance among other things inside the SEZ.“Every year, new entrepreneurs book plots, but do not set up their factories due to associated tough conditions,” said Saput Dumre, assistant director of SEZ. Dumre said industrialists are concerned about the mandatory export provision. According to SEZ guidelines, which were amended three months ago, firms that lease space inside the SEZ must export at least 30 percent of manufactured goods. “There is a water tank in the SEZ, but it has no water, the weighing machine does not work, the petrol pump is defunct, there are no parking areas, and the road is covered in thick bushes,” said Ujjwal Prasad Kasaju, a central member of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry. Then there is the new Gautam Buddha International Airport—all dressed up, and nowhere to go. The airport awaits applications for flight slots from international airlines after more than two years of opening.Nepal's second international airport was ready after ten years and nearly Rs40 billion pumped into the project, but despite the build-up, the expected rush of eager carriers is nowhere to be seen.The airport is a landmark located in south central Nepal and spread over 787 bighas (533 hectares).The modern facility has a 15,169-square-metre terminal building that can serve nearly a million passengers a year. The airport's 3,000-metre runway is long enough to handle the largest commercial jets. However, no commercial jet wants to fly to the airport. \nIn Kathmandu, where construction dust often clouds the air, the resumption of the pavement widening project at New Road on July 17 has elicited mixed reactions. While some citizens harbour doubts and disagreements, people with disabilities have their fingers crossed as well. For Narayani Dawadi, who is visually impaired, the initiative offers hope and apprehension in equal measures. She worries that the Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) might overlook the parameters for disabled-friendly infrastructure and execute the project superficially.Dawadi’s scepticism is not unwarranted. Her distrust stems from her 20 years of experience navigating Kathmandu, where she has become familiar with its footpaths and pavements. Despite this familiarity, she cannot navigate confidently due to the ever-changing, unpredictable condition of the pavements.“I don’t know if I can call the footpaths accessible,” Dawadi says. “There is tactile paving for white cane users but it’s not perfect. Sometimes they guide us to a pole or a tree, and in many places, there are only partial tactile guides, leaving us confused.”Her experience highlights a recurring issue: lack of a reliable, consistent infrastructure for people with disabilities in Kathmandu.The roads and footpaths that appear fine during the day are often damaged or under-construction by the evening, giving people with disabilities a hard time navigating them.Dawadi isn’t entirely critical; she appreciates the KMC’s sidewalk widening projects and regulations on street vending and parking. Areas like Baneshwar have become much easier to navigate, Dawadi says.However, Dawadi hopes the KMC doesn’t just displace street vendors without providing alternatives. “They need options that won’t affect their income; a crackdown won’t work.”Dawadi emphasises that KMC shouldn’t view current projects as a complete solution to make public infrastructure ‘disabled-friendly.’ Issues like half-finished tactile paving, narrow roads, and misplaced poles and tiles need to be addressed. “People with disabilities should be involved in planning,” she says.Rishi Dhakal, 44, a wheelchair user for the past 21 years and president of the Spinal Cord Injury Network Nepal, says that while the KMC has been building new footpaths and pavements with nice bricks and tiles, they often fail to meet the measurements for wheelchair use.Rishi notes that the footpath in Narayantar, between Bagmati Bridge to Jorpati Chowk, has become easier for pedestrians and the visually impaired due to reduced parking and fewer street vendors. But it remains inaccessible for wheelchair users due to a lack of proper slopes.“On many footpaths, especially at crossroads, the slope is not favourable for wheelchairs to climb,” he explains. “The footpath has become just a showpiece.”Rishi and his organisation are working to arrange a meeting with the minister and secretary of the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport to present a memorandum advocating for wheelchair-friendly slopes on Kathmandu’s footpaths. On July 21, Rishi met with the ministry’s Joint Secretary Sushil Babu Dhakal to discuss the next steps.While Rishi appreciates the ongoing work to widen pavements on New Road, he doubts the standard measurements for slopes and inclined planes for wheelchair users will be adhered to, citing KMC’s recent work on footpaths near Tribhuvan International Airport where the slopes are inaccessible.Another wheelchair user, Muskan Adhikari, pointed to a double problem of inaccessibility: footpaths lack slopes, and the sky bridges are not wheelchair-friendly. Moreover, she has faced incidents where vehicles did not stop at crossings when traffic police were absent, leading to several close calls.Rishi’s organisation has also received reports of incidents of wheelchair users being hit by vehicles in the Jorpati area.“The constitution promises accessible infrastructure for people with disabilities to navigate independently, but the current footpaths and infrastructure makes independent travel very difficult,” Adhikari said. “Forget pavements, even government offices are not accessible.”Rishi says that even the Health Ministry is only accessible up to the first floor, “forcing us to wait all day for meetings as ministers do not sit on the first floor.” This lack of accessibility extends to the KMC office itself, which has a metal ramp that is extremely difficult for wheelchair users to use and there is no tactile paving either.Vishwo Shrestha, director at the Blind Youth Association Nepal, reveals that their organisation frequently receives reports of blind and visually impaired individuals falling into sewers and rivers due to inadequate safety measures. In Sukedhara, where several offices catering to the blind community are located, a lack of proper fences along Dhobikhola river had previously resulted in accidents. The association had petitioned the KMC a year and a half ago for guard rails or road safety barriers.“Despite the installation of guard rails, there have been recent cases of individuals falling into the river due to gaps in the barriers,” Shrestha says. Shrestha adds that while not all incidents are reported, they receive two to three cases every two months involving falls into rivers or sewers. Many incidents involving collisions with poles or trees due to poor tactile guidance or uneven footpaths go unreported. “This reflects a major failure of the state’s duty,” he said.Meanwhile, for 36-year-old Radha Kumal, a blind white cane user, problems in footpaths and pavements are just part of the larger problems in the country’s road infrastructure. “We don’t know where the zebra cross begins, and traffic lights are useless for us as we cannot see the colour change,” she says. Many like Kumal hope for audio signals at traffic lights to ensure safe and independent road crossings.Sukhdev Ray, 41, who is deaf and lives in Baneshwar, points out a different but equally critical issue: lack of proper signage. “Without clear directional signs in public spaces like pavements, it’s hard for us to find our destinations,” Ray says. “As I can’t hear, I rely on signs for guidance.”Ray also adds that many traffic lights either malfunction or are ignored by drivers. “Crossing the road can be chaotic,” he notes. “With drivers in a rush and traffic lights often disregarded, I often fear getting hit, like I was the last time.”Ray was hit by a motorcycle while walking at Satdobato four months ago. Though he didn’t suffer major injuries, he is still reminded of the incident while walking on the road. He was also hit by a Safa tempo twice in Bhaisepati in June.Sugam Bhattarai, general secretary of the National Federation of the Disabled Nepal (NFDN), acknowledges that the KMC’s new footpaths and railings are a step forward but “they are usually limited to major areas like New Road and lack comprehensive accessibility features.”According to Bhattarai, in Nepal, the term ‘disabled-friendly’ often translates to just adding tactile paving and a ramp, ticking off an ‘inclusivity checklist’ without genuinely addressing accessibility needs. “What about individuals with deafness or intellectual disabilities?” he questions. The Act Relating to Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 2017, and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD), which Nepal has ratified, mandate accessibility to infrastructure.Article 9 of the UNCRPD says, “States Parties shall take appropriate measures to ensure to persons with disabilities access to the physical environment, transportation, information and communications, and other facilities and services open or provided to the public, both in urban and in rural areas.”Despite these legal frameworks, implementation remains inconsistent.Kumal shared that the ongoing pavement widening project at New Road has uprooted both sides of the road, leaving no alternative paths or assistance for the blind. “There’s no guidance or facilities for us,” she said.Shrestha criticises the KMC’s approach for lacking provisions for the blind and visually impaired. “Construction continues without first ensuring alternative routes or proper information,” he said.Nabin Manandhar, spokesperson for the KMC, assures that their pavement widening project at New Road includes considerations for disability access. “While we’re committed to making footpaths accessible, we’re not yet at the stage where we can address all types of disabilities,” he said.“We’ve just started. We welcome suggestions and acknowledge that we can’t address every issue alone.”Baburam Bhattarai, an expert member at the City Planning Commission under the KMC, emphasised that new projects adhere to disability guidelines. “We are monitoring compliance and plan to address issues with old pavements, including complaints about obstructing electric poles,” he said.However, officials blame funding constraints as a barrier in implementing good ideas.In 2021, the Department of Roads allocated Rs50 million for disabled-friendly pavements. The first phase (1.5km from Putalisadak to Thapathali) was completed, but the second phase at Durbarmarg and Jamal was halted due to budget constraints, according to Narayan Dutta Bhandari, division chief of the Road Division of Kathmandu.Rishi said that they, along with the NFDN, will start monitoring construction across the capital. If the right parameters are not followed, they will negotiate with the KMC, even if it means halting the work, he said.“We’ve learned to navigate the inconveniences in Kathmandu’s pavements and roads, but that doesn’t mean they’re not problematic,” Kumal says. “Accessible infrastructure is our right. While we do our best to adapt, we expect the government to adapt to our needs as well.” \nThe Monetary Policy for Fiscal Year 2024-25 issued last Friday by the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB), the monetary authority of Nepal, is generally hailed as expansionary. Nepal’s stock market responded positively to it, triggering a bull run and circuit breaks on Sunday’s trade, the first day of trading after the policy announcement. The Nepal Stock Exchange Index crossed the 2,700 mark after 29 months.The market seemed to have responded positively to the abolition of the Rs200 million ceiling to institutional investors in margin-type lending by the bank and financial institutions, an extension of the loan repayment period for the construction businesses by the end of December 2024, and provision for uncollateralised loans to those going for foreign employment, among others. These, indeed, are more reactive than well-thought-out sustainable policy responses that are unlikely to deliver desirable impacts on containing the severe recessionary trends faced by the economy.Monetary policy-makingFor decades now, Nepal’s monetary policy formulation has been a ritual orchestration rather than a substantive assertion of legally empowered independence by the NRB. The first compromise on monetary policy independence emanated from the fact that the Nepali currency is strictly pegged with the Indian currency. Pragmatically, the pluses of this arrangement may outweigh the minuses for the Nepali economy, so policymakers are not even considering discontinuing it.First, according to the universally acclaimed monetary theory of the impossible trinity, “a country can’t have a fixed exchange rate, independent monetary policy, and free capital movement all at once”. This means that no monetary policy can be ‘independent’ as long as it is pegged with any other currency. But we continue to embrace this impossibility.Second, the central bank shoulders three distinct responsibilities: Controlling inflation, ensuring financial sector stability through supervision and regulation, and, for all practical purposes, functioning as the government's key development finance agency. This reality has often obviated the NRB from an undivided focus on the 'core' central banking functions of money supply, inflation targeting and aversion to systemic risk.Third, the monetary authority and the monetary policy it brings out are often burdened with undue expectations beyond their jurisdiction and capacity. For example, a monetary policy is expected to come out with stimulus packages to ‘rescue’ the economy reeling down the recession, which could be appropriately addressed only by a bold and creative fiscal policy. The monetary policy can only complement this endeavour by managing financial resources for the same.Fourth and the saddest of all, the central bank is exhausting all its autonomy and energy in utterly un-innovative ritualisation of the tasks it should have shed decades ago. For instance, the directed lending policies in the name of the priority sector, deprived sector or the schemes aimed at financial inclusion should no longer be part of monetary policy since they may give rise to a conflict of interests between the roles of a regulator and concessional development financer. The most striking ambiguity of the sort is manifested in the NRB dilemma in dealing with microfinance institutions.The missesThe Monetary Policy appeared as if the central bank was unaware of the current economic malaise and the sources of recalcitrant stagnation. One major sector where the banks have over-invested in the past and suffocated at present is real estate. Except for raising the credit limit from 50 to 70 percent of the valuation to the homeowners with a ‘proven tax file’, the policy has left the land and housing entrepreneurs completely at bay. With India reducing duties on gold imports by 9 percent, as announced in the country’s annual budget last week, the gold market in Nepal, for better or worse, is going to be impacted differently. It will have a bearing on both investment and foreign exchange reserves. The new monetary policy grossly overlooks this phenomenon.Despite repeating a decade-old idea of setting up a second-tier oversight institution to regulate the saving and credit cooperatives and streamlining the operations of the microfinance institutions, the policy has blatantly failed to reinvigorate the small-and-medium-enterprise (SME) ecosystem. At present, the SMEs of Nepal face a grave crisis of legal/official recognition that has, in turn, impeded their access to formal financing mechanisms.The Economic Census of Nepal 2018 has shown that out of 923,356 establishments, only 462,605, or 50.1 percent, are registered. The rest—49.9 percent—have no legal identity. These are important entities providing self-employment and livelihood support to a large population. However, they have hardly any scope to find sizable investments and scale up their operations to enable them to reap the benefits of economies of scale. Again, it must not be misconstrued that the central bank should be directly involved in financing these SMEs. However, as a policy-maker, it should make functional arrangements by engaging relevant stakeholders like the subnational governments to facilitate and recognise grassroots businesses. This reflects the glaring gap in the public policymaking mindset that devolved financial power under federal polity can help optimise implementation, including monetary policy.Flimsy approachSome haphazard and over-ambitious policies have only eroded the central bank’s credibility as the regulator. A provision not to blacklist the contractors deliberately issuing bank checks without adequate balance in their accounts is in direct contravention of the best universal practices in banking.The monetary policy proposes to support the government in achieving an economic growth rate of 6 percent, as proposed by the budget of the current fiscal year, through liquidity management and credit disbursement towards the productive sector. It projects the broad money supply to be at 12.0 percent and credit disbursement to the private sector to grow at 12.5 percent. This means an increase of about Rs660 billion from the current Rs5.3 trillion disbursements of loans.The target is clearly to invest about Rs700 billion worth of loanable funds now lying idle in the system. This is a huge ask considering that during 11 months of the last fiscal year, loans from banks to the private sector increased only by 5.1 percent.The policy also fails to address the risk of alarmingly increasing non-performing assets in the banking system, making the banks more hesitant to invest aggressively. Such policy orchestration does not support the wider agenda of overdue structural reform of the financial system.  \nWhen the Ranjitkar group was established, they discovered this forgotten dance and devoted two years to researching it.Now, they are reintroducing it during Indra Jatra by training the new generation in this traditional art form. \nHe is known for his nationalist legacy, marked by the amendment of Nepal's map to include territories like Kalapani, Lipulekh, and Limpiyadhura, and his strong stance against India, especially during and after the 2015 Nepal blockade.But how did he rise to become the country's powerful man? \nPyakuryal holds a Phd in Public Affairs from the University of Akron, US. In this interview, they discuss Nepal’s elusive political stability, the narratives governing Nepali politics, the role of patriarchy, and the trends in Nepali politics Pyakuryal will be closely following in the years ahead. \n\nWriter and journalist Ghanshyam Khadka has released a new book, ‘Ananda Samhita.’ Known for his novel ‘Nirvana’, Khadka discusses philosophical insights on attaining a joyful life in this latest publication.Khadka's book highlights the issue of human suffering, delving into its root causes and exploring methods to end it to achieve lasting happiness.A statement by the publisher Alchemy reads, “While everyone spends their lives searching for happiness, many end up facing the opposite outcomes, leading to the belief that suffering is the reality of life.” They added, “This book discusses how anyone can achieve happiness under any circumstances if pursued with the right approach.”Each chapter of the book presents a straightforward concept of happiness and a practical method for implementing it.'Aananda Samhita' delves into the philosophical foundations of joy, examining how spirituality, psychology, and daily life intersect. Khadka explores these areas by providing readers with an understanding of joy beyond superficial happiness.The book also analyses different perspectives on happiness, explaining overcoming small and large obstacles in everyday life. \n“Factionalism is unacceptable in our party,” Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, who also chairs the CPN-UML, said at a party meeting on Sunday.Some people might provoke factional feuds on the pretext of strengthening internal democracy in the party, but that is not allowed in the UML, Oli said. “Some of you might take it lightly, arguing that we have heard such dictats since a long time ago,” Oli emphasised. “But it is not something to ignore. It is something to heed seriously.”Oli cautioned the party members against groupism in the party, while administering the oath to the newly appointed vice-chair of the party, Guru Baral, two standing committee members, Mukunda Neupane and Lilanath Shrestha, and 17 central committee members at the party’s central office in Chasyal, Lalitpur on Sunday.Though Chairman Oli ruled against promoting factional activities within the party, some UML leaders accuse him for giving rise to factionalism.It is common practice worldwide to pursue a “two-line struggle” in a communist party. During the party convention, rival leaders often present parallel political documents.While the incumbent party chief presents a political paper, those from the anti-establishment camp float a different paper to counter its ideas. This eventually sets the ground for a two-line struggle in a communist party. Though communists tried to sugarcoat the two-line struggle as a way to rejuvenate party activities and strengthen intra-party democracy, political analysts say such exercise is limited to propping up factions. For Nepali politicians, factions are platforms to exercise power. “When two or more leaders with parallel influential groups exist within the party, that often results in factionalism,” Keshav Dahal, a political analyst, told the Post. “But when there are no leaders to challenge the party’s top leader, there remain fewer chances for groupism.”After a group of UML leaders under former party chiefs Madhav Kumar Nepal and Jhala Nath Khanal split the party to form the CPN (Unified Socialist) in 2021, there was no one to openly challenge Oli. Therefore, the UML doesn’t have a faction now running activities parallel to the party establishment from the centre to the grassroots, which used to be the case in the past.Oli was the one who led a strong faction for many years when Nepal or Khanal was the party chief. Then, why is Oli himself afraid of factional activities in the party?UML leaders say there are no reasons for the party chair to fear from an exercise of intra-party democracy if the top leaders don’t promote factional activities.“It is the duty of the party leader not to engage in factionalism within the party, rather than urging party members not to do so,” Usha Kiran Timilsina, a central committee member of the UML, told the Post. “If the leadership does not promote this, party members will automatically avoid factionalism.”Another UML leader lambasted Oli for being the party's arbitrary leader and a promoter of groupism.A UML standing committee member said the party’s central secretariat meeting on August 1 showed favouritism while deciding a work division among top leaders. He claimed that leaders close to Oli and General Secretary Shankar Pokharel got important responsibilities while others were sidelined.When Prithvi Subba Gurung, the minister for communication and information technology in the Oli Cabinet, is relieved of party responsibilities after becoming minister, Finance Minister Bishnu Paudel of the same Cabinet is given the party’s responsibility as well, the leader told the Post, requesting anonymity.According to the work division decided last week, Paudel still coordinates the monitoring of the party’s organisational activities. Gurung had earlier got the responsibility of leading the party’s parliamentary affairs department. Now Gurung heads no department in the UML.The newly appointed central committee members are loyal to party chair Oli and General Secretary Pokharel, the leader claimed.But Krishna Bhakta Pokharel, who was sworn in as a central member on Sunday, ruled out factionalism in the party. “It was not groupism that party chair Oli pointed to while administering the oath to us,” Pokharel told the Post. “The party chair only tried to make party members aware of the possible foul play against the UML.”Despite being one of the organising members of the 10th general convention of the UML held in Chitwan in November 2021, Pokharel, who earlier was a central committee member and two-time lawmaker, was excluded from the committee.Left-leaning analysts also claim that there is intense rivalry between various groups at the provincial level even if there is no vertical division at present.“But the party is not free from groups exercising parallel activities within the organisation,” Jhalak Subedi, a left-leaning political analyst, told the Post.Political analyst Dahal also claims that even though there are no leaders in UML to challenge the party chair at present, there are struggles between party leaders to project themselves as being close to Oli. The tussle visible among second-rung leaders while picking the chief minister in Lumbini is the latest case in point.When the Congress and the UML decided to form the Lumbini provincial government under the UML’s leadership, many saw UML’s Lumbini Assembly leader Leela Giri as a natural candidate for chief minister.However, Chet Nath Acharya, the deputy leader of the assembly, was appointed the chief minister on July 22. Giri is close to party vice-chair Bishnu Paudel while Acharya is loyal to Pokharel. As General Secretary Pokharel is closer to Oli, the party chief directly instructed Lumbini assembly members of the UML to support Acharya—not Giri. “We are not sure why the party selected Acharya instead of Giri, but we believe it was due to the rivalry between party vice-chair Paudel and General Secretary Pokharel,” a provincial assembly member then told the Post on the condition of anonymity.“Due to the personal rivalry between Paudel and Pokharel, Acharya got the opportunity despite Giri having been considered the chief minister.”During the party's provincial convention held in September last year, Paudel and Pokharel were fiercely engaged in electing leaders loyal to them as the provincial committee chair. The same rivalry was evident while electing the chief minister, according to the leader.Soon after the appointment, Giri had said that if central leaders try to embrace their close supporters while sidelining others, that could sow the seeds of groupism in the party.However, when the Post contacted Giri on Sunday, he refused to comment on the selection of the chief ministerial candidate.Party insiders said that just like the Paudel-Pokharel rivalry in Lumbini, there are similar exercises in other regions as well. For instance, senior leaders Gurung and Khagraj Adhikari are vying for a grip on the party committees in Gandaki Province. \nIn March last year, the National Assembly unanimously endorsed a resolution motion directing the government to end discrimination and oppression against Dalits and ensure their proportional representation in all state agencies and structures.Appearing before the upper house, then-prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal committed to addressing the issues raised in the motion to the fullest extent possible. However, no Dalits were included in the Cabinet and his government overlooked the provision of proportional representation.KP Sharma Oli, who succeeded Dahal, followed suit. The Oli government is without a Dalit Cabinet member. Rupa BK, a junior minister, is the only representative of the community in the 25-member Council of Ministers.Like his predecessor, Oli has also overlooked their representation in other state agencies. Not a single ambassadorial candidate picked for 18 diplomatic missions is a Dalit. Dalits, considered the most marginalised community, comprise 14 percent of Nepal’s population. However, their representation in the state agencies is very low.Dalit lawmakers have taken serious exception to successive governments’ indifference to the resolution motion. On Friday, they voiced their concerns at the Public Policy and Delegated Legislation Committee of the National Assembly and accused the government of perpetuating discrimination against their community. The House committee has got the charge of monitoring the implementation of the motion.“The country has seen various political changes. However, the attitude of a certain group towards Dalits has not changed,” said Jagat Bahadur Parki, a lawmaker from the CPN (Maoist Centre). “I warn those in power that there could be a revolt from the Dalit community if the discrimination continues.”The lawmakers representing the community said Dalits have been discriminated against everywhere including in Parliament. There are 14 committees under the House of Representatives and the National Assembly combined, but none of them has Dalit as its chairperson.“The resolution motion was necessary as little attention was given to implementing the inclusive and non-discriminatory legal and constitutional provisions,” said Tul Prasad Bishwakarma, a Rastriya Janamorcha lawmaker. “Despite the commitment before the sovereign Parliament, nothing has been done to implement it.”A sub-committee to monitor the implementation of the motion held discussions with the secretaries at the prime minister’s office and various ministers in different periods, but without any progress.“No parliamentary committee has summoned responsible government officials to inquire about implementation status of the motion. This needs to be done immediately,” said Bhuwan Bahadur Sunar, coordinator of the monitoring committee.Along with proportional representation, the 19-point motion envisions directing the government to act strictly against all sorts of discrimination in public and private spaces and to ensure proper legal actions against the culprits. It also wants the government to report to the upper house about the steps it has taken to create an equal and equitable environment for the Dalits.The motion’s provisions also include free education for Dalit students up to the university level, and special reservations in vocational and technical education; assurance of social security to people from the community; and incentives to promote inter-caste marriages.“Direct all tiers of governments to allocate budget for the awareness campaign against caste-based discrimination,” reads one of the points in the motion.“Establish the offices of the Dalit Commission in all seven provinces and allocate necessary budget and resources so that they can effectively work to stop discrimination and oppression against Dalits and conduct monitoring.” The motion has pointed out lax implementation of the laws that criminalise caste-based discrimination as a major reason the practice persists in Nepali society.Responding to concerns of the lawmakers, Narayan Dahal, chairperson of the upper house, said it is vital for the entire House to stand together to put pressure on the government to implement the motion. “Caste-based discrimination is not just a Dalit issue, it is a national issue that concerns all. This must be a common issue for everyone,” he said. “It is vital to summon relevant government authorities and give necessary directives for its implementation.” \nWhen the Supreme Court’s verdict in March 2021 dissolved the then Nepal Communist Party (NCP) and revived the CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Centre), most of the leaders returned to their mother parties.A group of Maoist leaders, however, joined the UML. They included some key Maoist leaders such as Ram Bahadur Thapa, Top Bahadur Rayamajhi, Lekh Raj Bhatta, Prabhu Sah and Mani Thapa. Some central committee members and scores of other cadres from various lower committees followed them to join the UML, the bigger communist party among the two.The UML and the Maoist Centre jointly fought the general elections in 2017 and later merged to form the NCP in 2018. But the merger was challenged in court, accusing them of copying the name of a fringe communist party. The Supreme Court in 2021 invalidated the merger, reviving their original parties.While around 30 central level Maoist leaders had joined UML, only a few have succeeded to hold important positions in the UML.CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli on Thursday convened the party’s central secretariat meeting to divide work among the leaders as several of them have become ministers in federal and provincial governments. The same meeting relieved former Maoist leader Mani Thapa of all his positions and roles from the party citing his failure to fulfill the roles and responsibilities assigned by the organisation.Thapa, who was a standing committee member in the UML, however, had reportedly tendered his resignation around a year ago expressing his differences on various issues with the UML leadership.Former key maoist leaders Ram Bahadur Thapa and Lekh Raj Bhatta are now vice-chair and secretary in the UML, respectively. Former Maoist leader Top Bahadur Rayamajhi, who was elected UML secretary in 2022, is now suspended after he is accused in Bhutanese refugee scam. He is now in judicial custody as the case is sub-judice.Prabhu Sah, a prominent Maoist leader of Madhesh Province, quit the UML to form the Aam Janata Party.Lil Bahadur Thapa and Jwala Kumari Sah are politburo members in the UML.According to multiple UML leaders with Maoist background, Mani Thapa remained inactive in the party activities and he also remained inactive during the November 2022 election.A Maoist-turned-UML leader said that the former Maoist Centre leaders, who were given more importance at the time of NCP split and immediately after joining the UML, were gradually sidelined. “That was one of the reasons why Mani Thapa became inactive in party activities,” the leader told the Post requesting anonymity.At the time of the NCP split, UML chair Oli was in serious trouble as the then UML leaders Madhav Kumar Nepal, Jhalanath Khanal, backed by a powerful group of second-rung leaders, had challenged him in the party. At the time, Oli managed to stay in the leadership taking support of the former Maoist leaders.“Thapa was a standing committee member in the UML. I am not aware of what exactly he had expected in the party but he was unhappy,” another UML leader with Maoist background told the Post. “It was Thapa’s personal decision to stay away from party activities. It has nothing to do with the party’s work style.”The Post’s attempts to contact Thapa were unsuccessful.Among the leaders who left the Maoist Centre to join the UML, Ram Bahadur Thapa, Rayamajhi, and Bhatta had played crucial roles in leading the decade-long Maoist insurgency.Some UML leaders with Maoist backgrounds admitted that they get discouraged when the party leadership does not acknowledge the people’s war. At times, UML leaders including chair Oli express critical views against Maoists and their decade-long insurgency.“It is true that UML leadership, especially chair KP Sharma Oli, ruthlessly criticises people’s war, but it is also the fact that both the parties signed a 12-point agreement and agreed to work together for the betterment of the country in 2006,” a former Maoist, currently with the UML, told the Post.The leader said that UML is the suitable option for communists in the country as the Maoist Centre’s political prospects have drastically diminished in recent years. “Though some of their statements on the Maoist insurgency at times cause bitterness, UML is the safest place for us now,” he added.Niru Darlami, another Maoist-turned-UML leader, rubbished the claims that former Maoists were deprived of opportunities in the UML. Some Maoist leaders got a chance to become ministers after joining the UML, says a UML leader.Mani Thapa himself was never given a ministerial position as a Maoist Centre leader but soon after joining the UML, he got the opportunity to lead the Ministry of Water Supply under the KP Sharma Oli government.Similarly, Jwala Kumari Sah held ministerial berths more than three times after joining the UML.Giridharilal Naupane, another UML leader with Maoist background, claimed that the leaders’ former Maoist background was no longer an issue in the UML. “We former Maoist leaders have already been mixed in the UML like sugar in water,” he said. “If some former Maoist leader raises the question to UML, it is due to their misunderstanding.”Meanwhile, some leaders argue that the UML leadership didn’t support Rayamajhi when he got in trouble after being accused in the refugee scam. The party leader still considered Rayamajhi an outsider, they say.“If any UML leader other than Rayamajhi was indicted in the refugee scam, the UML would have made a lot of efforts to release him from custody,” a Maoist-turned-UML leader told the Post on condition of anonymity.However, Maoist-turned-UML leader Tanka Angbuhang, who claims to have met Rayamajhi recently in jail, claims that Rayamajhi himself does not feel the party has alienated him.“During our meeting, Rayamajhi did not show any displeasure to the party,” Aangbuhang told the Post. \nAs Nepal adopted the federal system while promulgating the constitution in 2015, the country’s governance was expected to be more effective with the centralised power being devolved to the seven provinces and local units.However, in practice, provincial leaders are too dependent on the top politicians at the centre when it comes to forming and running the sub-national governments.Though the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML have pledged political stability in the country, observers are not convinced as the two parties too are for rotating the government leadership after some time both at the centre as well as in the provinces.The country’s mixed electoral system has been giving fractured results, resulting in no single party being able to form the government, not only at the centre but also in the seven provinces. The result is that the parties must form coalitions to constitute national as well as subnational governments. Every change of ruling partners at the centre has immediate implications on the provincial level. This was not envisioned while drafting the constitution, according to experts.Before the federal system, the authority was centralised. Even though the country was divided into five development regions and 75 districts, they only served as administrative hubs and centres. The new constitution gives executive as well as legislative powers to the provincial governments. Also, the local governments have all executive, legislative and judicial powers exercised by an elected council.“The country’s federal structure was designed to devolve the central government’s rights to the provinces and local units. But, in practice, the centre has grabbed hold of the provinces’ rights, in the same manner as in the old political structure,” former lawmaker Radheshyam Adhikari of Nepali Congress, who was a member in the Constituent Assembly as well, told the Post. “This was not how the federal structure was envisioned while drafting the constitution.”Blaming the electoral system for the prolonged political instability, the Congress-UML coalition has now vowed to amend the constitution and electoral laws purportedly to ensure stability. However, Adhikari questions the rationale behind such an amendment.“If the political leadership allows provinces to exercise their rights without dictating their daily functions from the centre, the federal system will still work,” he adds. “But they are afraid to give up power that they have been exercising for years to the subnational governments.”The July 1 change in the central coalition caused immediate jolts at the provinces.As per the two-party agreement, the UML formed the government at the centre with the Congress rallying KP Sharma Oli of the second largest party.The two parties also reached an agreement to lead governments in three provinces each while they supported the Janamat Party to form the provincial government in Madhesh. As per the deal, the UML will lead governments in Koshi, Lumbini, and Karnali provinces in the first round while the Congress will take the reins in Bagmati, Gandaki and Sudurpaschim. Except in Sudurpaschim, the governments in the other five provinces have already been formed. Chief Minister of Sudurpaschim Province Dirgha Sodari of the CPN (Unified Socialist), which is now in the opposition coalition, resigned on Friday.This arrangement in the provinces will change again, with the handover in federal government leadership to the Nepali Congress after two years from the day Oli was appointed the prime minister. Prime Minister Oli, reading out the seven-point agreement from the rostrum of Parliament on July 21, said he will lead the federal government for two years, and hand over the mantle to Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba.With the change in leadership at the centre, coalitions in the provinces too are expected to realign. “Even so, there will not be the kind of instability we saw earlier,” says Congress Chief Whip Shyam Kumar Ghimire.With the change of power equations at the centre, the whole dynamics of provincial politics changed, he said. For instance, in under two years, the Koshi government changed five times. “Though the provincial governments’ leadership can change as per the two-party deal, the Congress or the UML will continue to lead, thus providing political stability.” There are already signs of discord in the Congress-UML alliance.Congress and UML leaders have already started disputing power sharing in Gandaki Province, where Congress is leading the government.UML provincial leaders have been warning Gandaki Chief Minister Surendra Pandey of the Congress not to take long-term decisions as they expressed reservations over some of his moves. While forming the two-party coalition, the leaders said they wanted to ensure political stability, among other things. But political observers aren’t very optimistic. “The agreement between the two major parties says the leadership of the provincial governments will be rotated within an agreed timeframe. This will only lead to more instability,” Pitambar Bhandari, a political observer, told the Post. “The way our political parties are trying to run the federal structure, there could soon be a systemic crisis.” \nThe Lions Club of Kathmandu Corporate, Nepal MD325-D has felicitated various personalities as part of its endeavour to recognise the contribution of the individuals and business entities for the society.As part of its campaign, the Lions Club of Kathmandu honoured Prateek Pradhan with Social Journalism Award, Sylapa T Rimponche with Social Spiritual Award, Erika Gurung with Social Player Award, Ramesh Corporation with Social Corporate House Award, Rajendra Malla with Social Corporate Leader Award and Rajesh Hamal with Social Celebrity Award.Likewise, Chandra Ghimire is honoured with Social Bureaucratic Award, Binod Das with Sports Management Award, Anil Kedia with Social Academic Award, Mohan Ojha with Social Management Award and Surya Nepal with Corporate Social Responsibility Award.The Lionism embarked in Nepal in 1971 as the Lions Club of Biratnagar under the stewardship of former Prime Minister Matrika Prasad Koirala.The Lions Clubs International says it has over 2,000 clubs operating across the nation. \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City has resumed pavement widening in the New Road area from Wednesday. Officials at the Public Construction Department under the metropolis said that the contractor resumed the work after the High Court, Patan issued an interim order paving the way for following an interim order from the High Court, Patan allowing the work to proceed. “Now there is no obstruction from locals nor from federal government agencies,” said Baburam Bhattarai, a member of the City Planning Commission under the KMC. “We hope that the project will be completed at the earliest.”The metropolis had awarded a contract to widen the sidewalks by 1.5 metres along both sides of the road section between the New Road gate and the Juddha Statue roundabout in the last fiscal year. The work started in the New Road area in May, but a jurisdictional dispute between the city office and the Road Division, Kathmandu, caused the project to come to a halt. The division confiscated contractors’ equipment, and the federal government deployed police in to prevent the city office from working. Some local residents, too, had demonstrated against the pavement widening plan. The division had even repaired the parts of roads cut for pavement expansion.And on June 9, the metropolis moved the High Court challenging the breach of jurisdiction by the road division, which is a federal agency, and its intervention in the city’s work.City officials were already frustrated by the years-long delay by federal agencies in completing another project, the widening of Kathmandu’s Ring Road in the Kalanki-Maharajgunj section, which has caused huge inconvenience to the public due to dust and mud.Mayor Balendra Shah then directed city officials to dump truckloads of dirt from the Ring Road section in front of the main entrance of the Road Division office at Minbhawan, accusing federal agencies of delaying the work.The 8.2km Kalanki-Maharajgunj section was set to be widened by the Chinese government, and the work was initially planned to start in early 2020, but the project has not progressed even after years due to Covid and delays in clearing the power poles and in some cases structures along the right of way.Regarding the jurisdiction dispute over the sidewalk widening work in the city, a division bench of judges Dhurba Raj Nand and Prakash Kharel at the High Court Patan issued an interim order in favour of the metropolis on Sunday.The City office has already widening pavements by 1 metre on both sides in the Bhrikutimandap area. “Neither did the federal government agency intervene, nor did locals object while expanding pavement in the Bhrikutimandap area by narrowing the road,” said Bhattarai. “Further decisions on pavement widening in other areas like Thamel, Handigaun and others will be taken after collecting public feedback.”Officials said that the long-term plan is to restrict motor vehicles altogether in the New Road area due to heavy pedestrian traffic. “We have also been working to find a solution to the parking problem and weighing various options including setting up multi-storey parking facilities,” said Bhattarai, who is also an urban planner.Officials said that pavements in the New Road area, which always remain crowded, should be widened to ensure free pedestrian movement. Officials claimed that New Road residents have also requested the city office to expand the pavement.According to city officials, local residents have, from time to time, complained about feeling unsafe and experiencing sexual harassment on the narrow and crowded sidewalks. \nIn a bid to prevent garbage from piling up on streets during the monsoon, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City has deployed heavy equipment including bulldozers, excavators, and loaders, to clear the road to the landfill site. Officials said the move aims to ensure smooth transfer of waste as roads to the landfill often become impassable during the monsoon, preventing the passage of garbage trucks.“We have deployed three excavators, two bulldozers and two loaders to clear landslide debris along the road to the Bancharedanda landfill,” said Rabinman Shrestha, chief of the Environment Department at the metropolis. “Also, we have kept five more vehicles on standby for immediate deployment if needed.”Every year, during monsoon season, the road to landfill sites gets obstructed in multiple places, obstructing the transfer of house waste collected in the three districts of the capital city—Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur. Apart from these, some local levels of Kavrepalanchok also discard garbage at the landfill site at Bancharedanda.The metropolis officials said that they had purchased 10 high-pressure pumps to drain floodwaters from inundated settlements.“Five pumps have already been sent to the high-risk areas along riversides,” said Shrestha. “These can quickly pump away floodwaters.”The city office started repairing the Sisdole road leading to the Bancharedanda landfill in Nuwakot district just a few weeks before the start of the monsoon. Officials said Rs30 million had been allocated for repairs, which included fixing potholes, concreting roads, and other works.Around 200 metres of road near the Sisdole area, which is often damaged by garbage trucks and excavators, will be concretised, according to officials.Besides monsoon-induced road obstructions, garbage disposal is sometimes disrupted due to obstructions by the residents living in settlements near and around the landfill site. These obstructions cause weeks-long halt to door-to-door garbage collection, leading people in the Valley to discard their trash on streets.Officials said that a high-pressure pump is being used to prevent the overflow of leachate from the dumping ground.Landfill leachate is a hazardous liquid containing harmful bacteria, chemicals and other components. It forms when rainwater passes through a landfill or when organic matter decomposes naturally.Officials say the leachate needs to be re-injected into the landfill, which quickens the decomposition process of the landfill waste and prevents the liquid from flowing into the river. The City office has also started segregating degradable and bio-non-degradable waste materials from households in its seven wards. Wards 5, 7, 10, 12, 24 and 27 have been segregating the waste materials generated in the households. The city office has also arranged separate trucks for collecting segregated waste materials from the households.Degradable waste materials are being turned into compost at the KMC’s waste transfer station. Officials said that the metropolis has also been using reagents to expedite the compost-making process.The city office recently sold non-degradable waste worth Rs700,000.Waste segregation at the source was one of the measures Mayor Balendra Shah touted as a solution to Kathmandu’s chronic garbage problem. After he assumed office, Shah asked city residents to start segregating waste at the source. They started doing so, using separate bins in their homes. But the plan didn’t work, largely due to a lack of preparations on the KMC’s part.The Kathmandu Valley generates over 1,200 tonnes of solid waste every day, nearly 60 percent of which comes from the KMC alone. Experts say 60 percent of organic waste originating in the Valley can be converted into compost and the remaining 30 percent of non-degradable waste can be recycled. \nCome autumn, Nepal will deploy heavy lifter drones to transport garbage from the 6,812-metre tall Ama Dablam, south of Everest. This will be the first commercial work an unmanned aerial vehicle does in Nepal’s high-altitude zone.The heavy lifter from China’s biggest drone maker, Da Jiang Innovations (DJI), will take on tasks traditionally handled by Sherpas. Officials believe it will help reduce casualties on Everest.Then, in spring (March-May), DJI drones, which make sounds similar to a swarm of bees, will be put to work on Everest.It will fly to Camp I (5,943 metres) to supply ropes and ladders to prepare routes and bring garbage to the Everest base camp at 5,364 metres.On Sunday, a tripartite memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed between the Sagarmatha Pollution Control Committee, the Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Rural Municipality, and the Airlift Technology Pvt Ltd for the use of advanced drone technology to efficiently manage garbage in the mountains of the Khumbu region.In April, Chinese drone maker DJI conducted the world’s first drone delivery test on Everest.“After a successful test in April, we plan to use drones commercially in the Everest region,” said Jagat Bhusal, chief administration officer of the rural municipality that hosts Everest. The test result showed that the DJI FlyCart 30, the long-distance heavy lifter drone, could airlift 234 kg per hour between Camp I and Base Camp, a task usually accomplished by at least 14 porters in six hours. Drone manufacturer DJI is under the microscope as US lawmakers push for a ban on Chinese drones, amid deteriorating relations between the US and China, the world’s largest trading nations.Nepali officials and mountaineers, however, see the drone as a life-saving vehicle.Traditionally, local Sherpa guides are responsible for transporting supplies and clearing trash on Everest. They may need to cross the icefall over 30 times a season to transport supplies such as oxygen bottles, gas canisters, tents, food, and ropes.All climbers and guides must navigate the icefall on the route to the world’s tallest peak. The icefall is so notoriously dangerous that even experienced Sherpas hesitate to move when the sun shines.The Khumbu Icefall, a river of ice a kilometre or so long, is usually crossed at night or early morning, with climbers putting headlamps on their helmets.Normally, the route is crossed early in the morning, when the ice blocks and the hanging glaciers are stable and avalanche risks are low.During the day, as the sun warms the mountain, the hanging glaciers melt, and ice crumbles, increasing the risk of avalanche.“Using drones will help us avoid the dangers in the Khumbu Icefall,” said Bhusal. On April 18, 2014, an avalanche resulting from a falling serac buried 16 Sherpa guides in the Khumbu Icefall, eventually leading to the cancellation of the season’s expeditions.Last year, three Sherpa guides mobilised to prepare the routes were buried under the ice masses triggered by an avalanche in the Khumbu Icefall. Their bodies are yet to be recovered.The Himalayan Database and the government records show that nearly 50 individuals died on the icefall between 1953 and 2023.The climb from Everest Base Camp to Camp I takes six hours. Between these two camps lies the Khumbu Icefall, the most treacherous part of the route.The most exciting and easiest part of the route is reaching Camp II (6,400 metres), which takes four hours from Camp I.There is a set of restrictions in the mountains for carrying loads.According to government rules, workers climbing high altitudes must not carry loads exceeding 20kg between 5,000 and 6,000 metres, 17 kg between 6,001 and 7,000 metres, 14 kg between 7,001 to 8,000 metres, and 12 kg for altitudes above 8,000 metres.“Yes, there are concerns that the machines may actually cut jobs. But our sole purpose is to reduce potential deaths in the Khumbu Icefall, the danger zone,” said Bhusal.“We will train Sherpas, as drone operators cannot handle tasks at the higher camps. In the future, all work will be done by Sherpas.” In the trial phase, the drone could lift 30 kg from Camp I. However, its performance dropped to 18 kg from Camp II. “Based on the MoU framework, we will soon sign a commercial agreement with the drone supplier,” said Bhusal. “The municipality will monitor all the activities.”The municipality has, so far, spent Rs800,000 on the trial. Climate change is melting snow and ice, exposing even more garbage and bodies that have been covered for decades on Everest. This waste pollutes the natural environment and poses a severe health risk to everyone who lives in the Everest watershed.Nearly 100 tonnes of garbage were collected during this spring climbing season from Everest and Lhotse, which share the same base camp.According to the Sagarmatha Pollution Control Committee (SPCC), 77.19 tonnes of waste was collected from the Everest base camp alone during the Spring 2024 climbing season. With 8-9 tonnes coming from the higher camps brought down by the expedition agencies, the SPCC collected 85 tonnes of waste this spring.The breakdown of collected waste shows burnable garbage at 27.99 tonnes, recyclable garbage at 7.51 tonnes, human waste at 27.53 tonnes, and kitchen waste at 14.15 tonnes. The Nepal Army also collected over 11 tonnes of garbage. In Spring 2023, the SPCC managed nearly 70 tonnes of waste from expedition groups.Insiders say the Everest Base Camp has become more luxurious, leading to an accumulation of people and garbage. Nearly 60,000 people trek to the Base Camp annually.Since 2015, the SPCC has enforced the 8 kg garbage rule, requiring every climber ascending the Everest base camp to return with at least 8 kg of garbage. Visitors to Everest must also pay a $4,000 garbage deposit, which is refunded if the person returns with 8 kg.Before this year’s climbing season, the Supreme Court issued a mandamus order directing the government to regulate the rising number of expeditions on the world’s tallest mountain.The court order followed frequent traffic jams and increasing trash on Everest, which has even been called the ‘world's highest garbage dump’.“Drones can replace helicopters as a relatively low-risk transport vehicle to supplement supplies on the plateau, which will greatly expand the application space of UAVs,” Cai Yong, a senior engineer at East China Normal University, told Xinhua, the state news agency of China, after the April test.In recent years, more electric drones have been used in agriculture and forestry, power line inspection, logistics, and emergency rescue, and each breakthrough will help save human and material resources and protect the safety of life and property, Jin Wei, deputy secretary-general of the China UAV Industry Innovation Alliance, told Xinhua.The April tests used the DJI FlyCart 30 to fly three bottles of oxygen and 1.5 kg of other supplies from the base camp to Camp I of the world's highest peak and to carry garbage down on the return trip.During the tests, the DJI FlyCart 30 flew up to 6,191.8 metres on Everest, which straddles the Nepal-China border.  \nA year after rolling out the Nepal Trade Integration Strategy (NTIS), Nepal’s export of high-value products grew at a snail's pace in the last fiscal year.According to the statistics from the Trade and Export Promotion Centre, the export of high-value goods increased by 10 percent in the review period.NTIS 2023, which supersedes NTIS 2016, was implemented from the beginning of last fiscal year. The latest trade strategy is meant to support Nepal's graduation from the least developed country (LDC) status to a developing country by 2026.As per the statistics, export earnings from the goods identified by NTIS 2023 totalled Rs110.38 billion in the review period.Nepal’s total export amounted to Rs152.38 billion in the last fiscal year.The aim of NTIS 2023 is to diversify the export market for which a country-wise strategy was said to be prepared and implemented. But little has been done towards that end.“It’s true. Few works have been done for the implementation of the latest trade strategy and the result is not as expected,” said an official at the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies requesting anonymity. There are problems in production, quality entrepreneurship development and global price competitiveness in the implementation of trade strategy. “We have started consultation with the private sector and stakeholders since the beginning of the current fiscal year regarding the legal, resource and other aspects of effective implementation of a trade strategy in the current fiscal year,” said the official.The ministry has got a budget of Rs34.5 million for the implementation of NTIS in the current fiscal year. Officials said that budget constraint is one of the problems in the full implementation of the trade strategy.According to the latest NTIS estimation, around Rs463 billion will be required for its implementation.The major target of NTIS 2023 is to attain Nepal’s trade-to-GDP ratio of 55 percent by 2026 from 43.81 percent in 2021. Trade is the sum of exports and imports of goods and services measured as a share of the gross domestic product (GDP).Proper coordination among the ministries and government bodies concerned is crucial for an effective implementation of the trade strategy but in the lack of the coordination there is a problem in budget mobilisation.“The development of entrepreneurship and its ecosystem from the private sector and increase in the government’s capital expenditure are also required to achieve the objective of NTIS.”Trade experts have been stressing for long that as Nepal is preparing to graduate from the “least developed” status by 2026, the increase in the export of high-value goods is not satisfactory which is not a good sign for the graduation.“The performances of former NTIS-listed goods were not good, demonstrating that Nepal failed to develop the products’ value chain. Making plans alone doesn’t work if they are not properly executed,” said Purushottam Ojha, former commerce secretary and trade expert in a recent interview with the Post. “There are problems in increasing and enhancing production, assuring quality and marketing Nepali products.”A major implication of LDC graduation is the loss of preferential market access available through LDC-specific schemes under the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) and other arrangements.After LDC graduation, Nepal may lose a huge European market as it might not get facilities under the Everything But Arms (EBA) initiative. This scheme grants full duty-free and quota-free access to the European Union Single Market for all products (except arms and ammunition).There are around 184 activities for the implementation of the NTIS and provision requiring monitoring and evaluation. But the monitoring mechanism does not seem to have done its work, a trade expert said. There should be a dedicated review after a certain time gap, which helps focus on problematic issues.The export of iron and steel products, readymade garment, fabrics, medicinal herbs, cement, footwear, lentils, fruits, honey and textile, yarn and rope has increased in the last fiscal year.Shipment of iron and steel rose by 60 percent to Rs17.40 billion during the review period, making it top exportable goods from listed products. The export of iron and steel contributed 11.4 percent in total export share.Export of textile, yarn and rope increased by 30.09 percent to Rs19.22 billion contributing second largest export from Nepal. The export of textile, yarn and rope contributed 12.6 percent to the total export.Readymade garment export increased by 9.12 percent to Rs8.96 billion in the review period.The export of fabrics increased by 6.68 percent to Rs2.52 billion while medicinal herbs shipment increased by 19.27 percent to Rs2.25 billion.Cement shipment jumped by 449.05 percent to Rs1.97 billion during the review period. Footwear exports grew by 22.84 percent to Rs1.32 billion.Nepal’s lentils export increased by 14.12 percent to Rs568.47 million while fruits export jumped 517 percent to Rs19.02 million. The export of honey rose by 210.83 percent to Rs57.47 million.The exports of carpet, readymade garment, cardamom, jute and related products, felt products, dog food, pashmina, rosin and resin acid, ginger, handmade paper, silver and gold jewellery, vegetable, tea, coffee and spice fell in the last fiscal year compared to the previous one.Shipments of carpet from Nepal declined by 8.12 percent to Rs10.57 billion while cardamom export declined by 4.06 percent to Rs7.94 billion.Exports of jute and processed goods fell by 7.86 percent to Rs7.04 billion.Shipment of felt products dropped by 8.18 percent to Rs4.79 billion in the review period.Dog chew export came down by 6.59 percent to Rs3.18 billion in the last fiscal year. Shipment of pashmina also fell 5.32 percent to Rs3.02 billion.Export of rosin and resin acids declined by 10.51 percent to Rs1.47 billion. Shipment of Nepali paper declined by 10.18 percent to Rs1.02 billion.Gold and silver jewellery exports declined by 69.14 percent and 22.39 respectively to Rs58.23 million and Rs167.05 million accordingly.Nepal’s tea, coffee and spice exports shrank by 4.48 percent to Rs13.44 billion.Shipment of pasta fell by 14.38 percent to Rs1.96 billion during the review period. \nAt the Nepal Tourism Board, the country’s tourism promotional body, crises appear to be hovering all around again.Politicking at the board, which operates under a public-private partnership model, has been a long-standing problem, affecting its national and international tourism promotional plans for decades.Political manoeuvring becomes rampant when the time for appointing a chief executive officer (CEO) begins every four years. And the key tourism promotional body is already headless.Apart from the politics over the chief’s appointment, the board has yet to introduce its annual budget, a serious matter for the agency promoting Nepal abroad.“The board is in severe crisis,” said a top board official. The crisis arrived after most countries launched free-visa policies to attract tourists.Nepal plans to draw 1.6 million tourists this year, but that will not be possible without promotions. Amid all this, the country’s poor air safety has further hindered tourism growth, the official said. There is now tough global competition to attract tourists.Laos is extending its visa exemption policy and increasing visa validity for tourists from certain countries.The Thai cabinet has rolled out a series of new visa promotions, including visa-free and visa-on-arrival schemes, extended student stays, and reduced compulsory health insurance for retirees. Under the new scheme, visitors can stay in Thailand for up to 60 days, compared to the earlier limit of 30 days.Indonesia plans to introduce visa-free entry for tourists from 20 nations, including India, by October this year.In December last year, Malaysia granted visa-free entry to citizens of China and India for up to 30 days.Zimbabwe is giving a leg up to its tourism industry with a new visa-free entry policy for 35 countries.However, poor planning, unstable politics, and plane crashes have marred Nepal’s tourism, the country’s economic growth engine, at a time when most economic indicators are dim.The tourism board has been headless since January 30 when the term of its former CEO Dhananjay Regmi ended.On top of that, the board is yet to present its annual budget. “We are on a budget holiday,” said Mani Raj Lamichhane, spokesman for the Nepal Tourism Board. “From Sunday, there will be not a penny to spend on day-to-day activities.”As per the board’s financial bylaws, it has to bring the full budget by July 9. If the budget is not passed by then, it can manage expenses for day-to-day activities through a partial budget up to August 9. And there is a mandatory provision of passing the budget by August 19. If the budget is not passed by August 19, the tourism board may face a legal crisis. “We don’t know what will happen in that case,” said another senior board official.Officials say that given the ongoing crisis, the full budget seems impossible.Last fiscal year, the board earned Rs1.04 billion in tourism promotional fees charged to foreigners who departed from Kathmandu’s Tribhuvan International Airport, the main source of its budget. However, only 30 percent of it has been spent. The board estimates that it will introduce a Rs1.25 billion budget this fiscal year.Lamichhane said they met Tourism Minister Badri Pandey on Wednesday, and the minister assured them that the budget would be passed.Officials say frequent government changes have affected the functioning of the board, creating a leadership vacuum. Power tussles have become common among the board of directors, appointed by different ministers belonging to different parties at different times. “In the board of directors, the members face four different directions. No agendas can be approved.”The 11-member Nepal Tourism Board comprises five representatives, each from the government and the private sector, and the CEO. The tourism secretary chairs the board.As per the law, even a six-member board can pass the budget. “We don’t know what’s stopping the tourism secretary, the board chair, from doing that,” said the official.The CEO appointment, too, seems uncertain. As per the process, a three-member CEO selection committee should be formed to appoint the chief.The sub-committee shortlists three candidates based on their presentations and interviews and submits their names to the board, ultimately selecting the CEO within 90 days of the committee’s formation.After Regmi’s term ended, the board of directors initiated the process of appointing a new CEO. However, the applications were invited only on April 6. Twenty individuals, including Regmi, had applied for the executive position. The sub-committee had shortlisted 16 candidates. However, this was challenged when a writ petition was filed at the Patan High Court questioning the legality of the sub-committee members.On April 29, the joint bench of High Court Judges Sudarshan Dev Bhatta and Kailash Prasad Subedi continued the short-term interim order issued on April 22, ordering the halt of the CEO selection process. The next hearing was scheduled for Sunday. However, the government has declared Sunday a public holiday, on the occasion of Bhoto Jatra. On this day, the Machhindranath chariot festival concludes with the showing of the legendary vest at Jawalakhel in Lalitpur.Kundan Sharma Mishra, an official at the tourism board, filed the writ petition, contesting the legality of the two board members Milan Devkota and Madan Kumar Acharya, who were nominated to the CEO selection subcommittee. The director general of the Department of Tourism is another subcommittee member.“As per the law, the Cabinet should appoint board members. But it was former tourism minister Prem Ale who appointed the two board members. This minister-level decision is illegal. If the appointment is illegal, the CEO they select will also be illegal,” said Mishra.Devkota and Acharya were appointed in March 2022.The CEO appointment process had run into controversy even in the past.In 2011, the board had shortlisted 12 applicants in the first week of November.However, it was four years later, in December 2015, that the CEO was appointed. In that period, more than two dozen writs were filed in courts to halt or postpone the appointment process.The tourism board, established in 1998 under the public-private partnership model, is mandated to promote Nepal in domestic and international markets.But the board soon became a political playground. \nNepal has eased the foreign exchange facility for Nepali travellers, traders, and those with dollar accounts as the central bank is awash with foreign currencies, with a historic high of reserves.As of mid-June, the 11th month of the last fiscal year, the country had Rs1.96 trillion in foreign exchange reserves. The Nepal Rastra Bank’s own stock amounts to Rs1.75 trillion.The central bank said on Thursday that it amended the unified directives to allow Nepali citizens travelling abroad to carry $2,500 per trip. Earlier, Nepali citizens were allowed $2,500 twice a year.“Two years ago, we set the limitation on foreign exchange facilities in view of the country’s depleting foreign exchange reserves. Now we have amended the unified guidelines and removed the frequency limit as resources have improved. It will be helpful for frequent travellers,” said Ramu Paudel, spokesperson for the central bank.However, the limit of the amount of currency available remains unchanged. The amendments are based on the central bank's recently announced monetary policy for the current fiscal year.Similarly, the central bank has doubled the foreign currencies available to Nepali citizens travelling to Tibet, China, and the SAARC countries. Nepali citizens travelling to Tibet via surface route can now get an exchange facility of $1,000 one time and $2,000 in a fiscal year. This will also apply to Nepalis travelling to the SAARC countries, excluding India, via surface route.This provision, however, will not apply to the residents of border regions who make frequent travels to Tibet.The country’s foreign currency stock has been breaking records in recent months, mainly due to a robust remittance growth and ever-increasing migrant departures to foreign lands in search of better incomes.Economists say that robust forex reserves suggest a scenario of low investments, particularly in a least developed country like Nepal.In June 2022, Nepal’s foreign exchange reserves slid to a critical level that could sustain imports of goods for less than six months. Even the central bank's import controls did not improve the situation.Instead, the measures nearly suffocated Nepal’s economy, according to the International Monetary Fund.Following the Russia-Ukraine war, which choked the global supply system and caused prices to rise like never before, Nepal, too, suffered chronic current account deficits and was increasingly vulnerable to external economic shocks, while forex reserves dwindled fast.In late April 2022, the government banned imports of at least 10 goods considered luxury or non-essential in a bid to stop the country’s foreign exchange reserves from depleting further. The ban was lifted in December 2022.Paudel said that the foreign exchange ceiling has gone higher not only due to the improving forex reserve situation but also to prevent the hassles that travellers and traders are facing.People who travel frequently despite the limited forex convertibility were facing the problem of submitting documents required by the central bank, he said. “The amended provision will help such travellers.”The central bank has also amended the foreign exchange limitation for traders.According to the amended provision, traders who import goods through demand draft and telegraphic transfer are allowed to import goods of $100,000 at once, up from $60,000 before.Paudel said that the traders ordering goods beyond the limitations are required to submit documents to the central bank.But with the amendment, they can access needed facilities from any commercial bank.The amended provision has increased the payment limitation to import silver.Bullion traders importing silver to produce silver jewellery, artistic goods, and utensils, among other things, can get a foreign exchange facility of $300,000 per import. The other bullion traders importing silver can get a foreign exchange facility of $100,000 per import.The foreign exchange limitation for companies outsourcing services from foreign countries and invisible imports by domestic companies and their sister concerns has increased to $25,000 monthly from $15,000 monthly. \nAmid monsoon rains causing widespread death and destruction, the risk of infection of water- and vector-borne diseases intensifies.Officials at the Ministry of Health and Population are bracing for tough days ahead, as the escalating monsoon not only pollutes sources of drinking water but also provides breeding grounds for various disease-spreading vectors.“Over 2,000 people from 73 districts have already tested positive for the dengue virus and several districts have witnessed outbreaks of waterborne diseases, including cholera,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “We are aware of the possible risks and have alerted the relevant agencies.”The division said that 23 cholera cases have already been confirmed in Lalitpur, Kailali and Kathmandu districts. Likewise, as many as 2,061 people from 73 districts have tested positive for dengue. Health facilities across the country have been grappling with a surge in water- and vector-borne diseases. “Infection of the dengue virus has not risen this time compared to the previous years,” said Ghimire. “Ongoing rain has contaminated drinking water sources which increases the risk of potential outbreaks of waterborne diseases in the coming days.”According to data provided by the division, among the 73 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases at 249, followed by Jhapa 130, Chitwan 105, Tanahun 87, Makawanpur 78, Kaski 74, Bhojpur 62, Kavrepalanchok 60, and Okhaldhunga with 59 cases.Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika, according to the World Health Organisation.Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. Likewise, cholera is a highly infectious disease that causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting, which in turn results in dehydration and can lead to death within a few hours if left untreated. The World Health Organisation says cholera is a global threat to public health and an indicator of inequality and a lack of social development.Health officials said that the Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool samples of the infected patients. They concede that the outbreaks of the deadly disease are being reported only from the districts having active case surveillance programmes. Active cholera surveillance is being carried out from 27 health facilities in Kathmandu Valley and 10 in Kailali district.The monsoon season in Nepal is a time of epidemics during which thousands of people across the country become infected with waterborne and vector-borne diseases. Officials warned that health facilities could witness an uptick in the number of viral fever cases, and waterborne diseases—diarrhoea, dysentery, food poisoning, and snakebites—in the coming days.The Ministry of Health and Population last month urged provincial and local health authorities not to grant leave to health workers during the monsoon season and step up vigilance about the potential risks.Officials say that they have been raising awareness through all available means to inform people of the risks and directed agencies concerned to stockpile essential medicines.Doctors say the only ways to prevent deaths from waterborne diseases, including diarrhoea, are to raise awareness and ensure safe drinking water.They say a combination of careful surveys, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation and treatment are required to contain the spread of the diarrhoeal infection. \nAt least 20 diarrhoeal patients—12 from Lalitpur, eight from Kailali and two from Kathmandu—were found to have contracted cholera recently. People residing in other districts may have also been infected with the deadly disease, but due to absence of an active cholera surveillance programme in most of the districts, no one knows what is going on.“Active cholera surveillance is being carried out only in the three districts of the Valley—Kathmandu, Lalitpur and Bhaktapur—and in Kailali,” said Dr Hemanta Chandra Ojha, an official at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “We have a system in place in other districts as well but intensive surveillance is being carried out in Kathmandu Valley and in Kailali only.”Cholera is a highly infectious disease that causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting, which in turn results in dehydration and can lead to death within a few hours if left untreated. The World Health Organisation says cholera is a global threat to public health and an indicator of inequality and a lack of social development.Health officials said that the Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool samples of the infected patients. They concede that the outbreaks of the deadly disease are being reported from the districts having active case surveillance programmes. Active cholera surveillance is being carried out from 27 health facilities in the Valley and 10 in Kailali district.“Report of cholera outbreak in districts having intensive cholera surveillance is an obvious thing, as we carry out testing only when we find problems,” said an official at the Department of Health Services, asking not to be named as he is not authorised to talk to the media. “We will not know anything about the cause of disease outbreaks, if we stopped testing.”Officials at the Ministry of Health and Population, however, claimed that even if active cholera surveillance programmes are not in place in most of the districts, systems are in place to collect stool samples of the diarrhoeal patients and send them for lab testing if needed.“We have provincial public health laboratories in all provinces that can carry out cholera testing, and we also bring samples to the National Public Health Laboratory for examination when a massive diarrheal outbreak occurs,” said Ojha of the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “We have an Integrated Health Information Management System and Early Warning, Alert and Response System, which reports about the disease outbreaks. Active surveillance is being carried out only in high risk districts.”Officials, who wish not to be quoted in news as they fear retribution for speaking to the media, however, said that Integrated Health Information Management System only provides monthly reports; moreover, the system provides only clinical reports, not the reports of lab testing. The Early Warning, Alert and Response System is also not very effective.“The thing is systems on which health authorities rely much do not give an exact picture of the disease outbreak, and such systems do not help contain massive outbreaks,” the official said. “Major outbreaks of waterborne disease could happen at any time and at any place, and authorities concerned get alerted only after loss.”Health officials concede that it is not the government that is carrying out active surveillance of the deadly disease in four districts but the International Vaccine Institute, Korea. When asked why the government does not think it necessary to carry out active cholera surveillance in other districts, they said that the existing health budget is insufficient for the task.Cholera outbreaks during the monsoon season are not a new thing in Nepal, as hundreds of people throughout the country suffer from diarrhoeal infections that continue for months every year and scores contract the disease.In 2022, a total of 77 cholera cases were confirmed in the Valley. Last year, health authorities administered an oral cholera vaccine in Kathmandu Metropolitan City’s wards 11, 12, and 13, which were highly affected by the outbreak.Public health experts say that due to poor sanitation and hygiene conditions, the country as a whole is highly vulnerable to water-borne illnesses including diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid, hepatitis, and cholera, with thousands of people getting infected every year.They say sheer negligence from authorities concerned is responsible for ongoing outbreak of diarrhoeal diseases including the deadly cholera.Health authorities in most local units had stopped the testing of drinking water just before the start of the monsoon season, citing lack of funds, although deadly microbes such as faecal coliform and E coli were frequently detected in drinking water samples.Faecal coliform and E coli, both microscopic organisms, are found in human faeces. According to doctors, the presence of faecal coliform and E coli in drinking water means it is contaminated with sewage.Doctors say bottled water, which is widely used by households and offices in Kathmandu Valley, is generally considered safe, but water quality of several companies have been found questionable. Dangerous microbes are detected in bottled water every year, which means not all jar water brands are safe to drink without treatment.Doctors have asked authorities to launch awareness drives against water-borne diseases and ensure safe drinking water to prevent deaths from illnesses like cholera.To contain the spread of the infection, a combination of careful surveys, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation, and treatment is required, according to doctors.The World Health Organisation also said that a multifaceted approach is key to controlling cholera and reducing deaths. \nThe polio immunisation drive launched in the Kathmandu Valley a week ago has achieved an impressive 104 percent coverage rate. This is not the first time coverage rate of a healthcare campaign has exceeded 100 percent.What concerns public health experts is that even if the coverage of the health campaign exceeds 100 percent every time, post-campaign surveys reveal actual coverage falling short.“We don’t have the exact count of the floating population or those living in the city slums,” said Dr Arjun Spkota, chief of Health Office Kathmandu. “Moreover there are refugees in the capital. Providing healthcare programmes to these groups is always a challenge. Chances of children missing vaccination or other health campaigns is always high in big and crowded cities like in the Kathmandu Valley.”Health authorities launched a special immunisation programme in the three districts of the Valley—Kathmandu, Lalitpur and in Bhaktapur—following the detection of a highly contagious poliovirus in sewage samples.Officials say that presence of type-3 poliovirus in sewage samples has been confirmed by the National Institute of Health of Thailand, a World Health Organisation’s collaborating centre. The virus, which originated from a vaccine, was detected in sewage samples collected from the confluence of the Tukucha and Bagmati Rivers [in Kathmandu] on May 26, according to them.Nepal has been polio-free since 2010, but was officially declared polio-free by the World Health Organisation only on March 27, 2014, after maintaining zero polio cases for three consecutive years.After having zero human cases of polio for about 14 years, the infectious disease has surfaced in the capital city’s sewage, which is a serious problem, according to public health officials. They said that the presence of poliovirus in sewage samples indicates the looming risk of an outbreak.The Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services had planned to carry out a four-day polio vaccination in all three districts of the Valley from July 24 but later extended for a week.All children under five years of age have been inoculated with an additional dose of oral polio vaccine in the drive.Oral polio vaccine, which consists of Type-1 and Type-3 polioviruses have been administered during the campaign. Health workers and female community health volunteers were deployed to homes, schools, bus parks, and entry points to ensure that no eligible children miss the vaccine. “We found over 3,000 children living in city slums,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section. “We are aware that children might still miss the vaccine despite our best efforts to meet the target.”The health ministry said that the vaccine coverage rate for polio is 95 throughout the country. An estimated 300,000 children live in three districts of the Valley. But the 104 percent coverage rate shows that more children reside in the Valley than estimated. Health authorities do not have exact data on the people residing in the city slums. Floating population, scattered slums, high density of working-class people, and lack of awareness and poor access to health services are some of the challenges identified in improving health indicators, experts say. They urge the authorities to focus on high-risk groups when designing health programs, as vulnerable populations are always disproportionately affected during disease outbreaks.Doctors say the poliovirus mainly affects children and is usually transmitted through droplets or aerosols from the throat and by faecal contamination of hands, utensils, food and water. Those who do not wash their hands properly, and those who consume contaminated food and water or reside in an area where water and sanitation conditions are poor are at high risk of getting infected with the virus.Experts urge health authorities to carry out post-campaign surveys to know the actual coverage of the campaign.“Achieving 104 percent coverage is more of an administrative number,” said Upreti, former director general, who is also a child health expert. “Health authorities must carry out a post-campaign survey to reveal the true picture.”Regular immunisation is one of the most successful programmes in Nepal, boasting a high coverage rate. The country has made remarkable progress in reducing the under-five mortality rate and the regular immunisation programmes are credited with this achievement. \nAt least three diarrheal patients— one from Kalimati in Kathmandu Metropolitan City, one from Tokha Municipality, and another from Gwarko of Lalitpur district—have tested positive for cholera. Officials at the Health Office Kathmandu said that the National Public Health Laboratory, which carried out testing on stool samples of diarrheal patients, confirmed cholera infection on Monday evening.“Reports from the laboratory confirmed cholera outbreaks in additional three places in the Valley, including two areas in Kathmandu,” said Dr Arjun Sapkota, chief of Health Office Kathmandu. “Earlier rapid diagnostic tests too had shown cholera infection in those patients.” With these additional cases, the total number of diarrheal patients testing positive for cholera across the country has reached 16 within a week. Last week, cholera outbreaks were reported in Godawari Municipality of Lalitpur district and Dhangadhi Sub-metropolitan City of Kailali district.At least 13 people—seven in Godawari Municipality and six in Dhangadhi Sub-metropolis tested positive for cholera, according to officials at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division.Cholera is a highly infectious disease that causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting, which in turn results in dehydration and can lead to death within a few hours if left untreated. The World Health Organisation says cholera is a global threat to public health and an indicator of inequality and a lack of social development.Health officials said that the Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool sample of an infected patient. Health officials concede that the outbreak of the deadly disease in several places at once shows that the cholera has spread to multiple locations of the Valley.According to Officials at the Health Office Kathmandu, the infected patients have been admitted at the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital and Chabahil-based Helping Hands Community Hospital. Following news of the suspected cholera outbreak, the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, along with Health Office Kathmandu and the local units, which are responsible for responding to the disease outbreaks, scrambled to contain the spread of the infection.“Contaminated water is the main culprit behind the cholera outbreaks in Lalitpur and Kailali,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director at the division. “Various programmes including water and sanitation initiatives, and awareness campaigns, are being organised in the affected areas.”The Kathmandu Valley often witnesses cholera outbreaks during the monsoon season, with hundreds of people suffering from diarrheal infections that continue for months. Public health experts say that due to poor sanitation and hygiene conditions, the country as a whole is highly vulnerable to water-borne illnesses including diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid, hepatitis, and cholera, with thousands of people getting infected every year.This year too, major hospitals in Kathmandu Valley have been grappling with a surge in cases of water-borne diseases including severe diarrhoea. “Fifteen to 20 diarrheal patients have been seeking care in our emergency department every day,” said Dr Ravi Shakya, director at the Patan Hospital. In 2022, a total of 77 cases of cholera were confirmed in the Valley. Last year, health authorities administered an oral cholera vaccine in wards 11, 12, and 13 of the Kathmandu Metropolitan City, which were highly affected by the outbreak. Public health experts said that sheer negligence from parts of authorities concerned is responsible for ongoing outbreak of diarrheal disease including deadly cholera. Health authorities in most local units had stopped testing of drinking water just before the start of the monsoon season citing lack of funds, although deadly microbes such as faecal coliform and E coli were frequently detected in drinking water samples.Faecal coliform and E coli, both microscopic organisms, are found in human faeces. According to doctors, their presence of faecal coliform and E coli in drinking water means it is contaminated with sewage.“Ensuring water quality is a regular job and basic duty of the relevant agency,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of Clinical Research Unit at the Sukraraj Hospital. “Such essential services should not be halted under any conditions.”Doctors say bottled water is widely used by households and offices in Kathmandu Valley and is generally considered safe, but water quality of several companies have been found questionable. Presence of dangerous microbes in bottled water every year, which means not all jar water brands are safe to drink without treatment.Doctors have asked authorities to launch awareness drives against water-borne diseases and ensure safe drinking water to prevent deaths from illnesses like cholera.A combination of careful surveys, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation, and treatment is required to contain the spread of the infection, according to doctors.The World Health Organisation also said that a multifaceted approach is key to controlling cholera and reducing deaths. \nOver the decade, Nepali doctors, categorised as “foreign national residents” in India’s prestigious All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), have been deprived of stipends.On June 26, Dr Indra Shekhar Prasad, the president of the Resident Doctors Association (RDA), and Raghunandan Dixit, general secretary of the RDA, wrote to the director of AIIMS and raised the issue of non-payment of stipends to the foreign national residents at AIIMS.“This long-standing grievance demands immediate redressal and your decisive intervention,” the letter said. “The RDA has tirelessly advocated for the rights of these residents, who contribute to AIIMS's mission despite facing this glaring injustice.”Most of the foreign students are from Nepal. Ekata Vyas, who campaigns on behalf of the Nepali students—estimated to number at least 60—told the Post that she is hoping for positive results this time. She has received positive feedback and responses from New Delhi and the Indian Embassy in Kathmandu. The monthly stipend ranges from IRs 90,000 to 1,20,000.Besides taking up the matter, the foreign national doctors, mostly from Nepal, took up the issue before 2011. According to the Nepali doctors who are serving in AIIMS, a case was filed in the Delhi High Court against the discriminatory provision over the stipends and arrears in 2011. The Delhi Court gave its verdict in favour of the students on July 16. In 2013, however, the AIIMS filed a counter case which was made absolute on December 4, 2017, after 27 hearings, most of them just formalities marked by absences on the bench and of defendants. A Nepali student said that since they did not have the time and resources to follow up on the case in court, it was dismissed. “Then, we started discussing the matter with government officials and diplomats,” said the student.During the Nepal visit of Indian prime minister Narendra Modi in 2018, then-prime minister KP Sharma Oli also took up the matter with the Indian delegation.“Then we came to know that the India prime minister's office directed the Ministry of External Affairs to look into the matter and expedite its resolution. The Indian Embassy in Kathmandu also confirmed to India’s Ministry of External Affairs that Indian students in similar courses are getting stipends equal to their Nepali counterparts from their respective institutions in Nepal. In May 2018, India’s Ministry of External Affairs wrote to the Ministry of Health and Family Affairs to examine and expedite the prime minister’s directive.Then, India’s health ministry wrote to AIIMS, the Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (JPIMER), and the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, seeking the details of the foreign national residents.“It is pertinent to note that esteemed institutions such as JIPMER and PGIMER have already rectified similar issues by ensuring stipend payments to their Foreign National Residents as early as 2020. AIIMS, renowned for its commitment to excellence and equity, cannot afford to lag behind in such matters of principle. As representatives of the RDA, we assert that the workload and dedication of Foreign National Residents are equivalent to their peers who receive stipends,” the RDA stated in its letter to the AIIMS director.After two premier health institutions started providing the stipends in April 2020, the Resident Doctors Association of AIIMS wrote to the Prime Minister's Office in India seeking its intervention and solidarity with the foreign national residents who have been deprived of the stipends for the past decade.Again in May of the same year, the AIIMS association wrote to the AIIMS director to recognise the efforts by foreign national residents during the pandemic and consider resuming the stipend, but the request went unheard.In January 2023, the AIIMS issued a public notice stating that the government of Nepal should sponsor these students.Nepal’s foreign ministry then clarified that the Nepali students had competed openly and were selected on merit with no sponsorship or role of the government of Nepal. It directed the Nepali Embassy in New Delhi to look into the matter. “We took up the issue with prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and urged him to raise the matter while meeting with Modi,” said the Nepali doctors. “In September, 2023, the Supreme Court of India issued a verdict in a similar case stating that nonpayment of stipend cannot be justified.”Arguing that it is equivalent to bonded labour, the verdict directed the Medical Council to take note of instances in which the stipend is not paid.The Indian government informed the Supreme Court of India that, as per its directive, action will be taken to ensure that there is parity in medical education. “We again wrote to the foreign minister of Nepal, the Nepali Embassy, and the Indian Embassy to discuss the matter during the bilateral commission meeting scheduled for the first week of January 2024,” a Nepali doctor said.Both foreign minister NP Saud and Nepal’s ambassador Shankar Sharma took up the matter during the seventh joint commission meeting held in Kathmandu, according to the students.Then, several meetings were held, correspondence was made by the resident doctors of AIIMS, and Nepali students submitted applications to the health minister of India, people informed on the matter said.\"RDA asserts that the workload and dedication of foreign national residents are equivalent to their peers who receive stipends,\" said RDA President Dr Inder Shekhar Prasad. \"Denial of their stipends not only undermines their morale but also tarnishes AIIMS's reputation as a beacon of medical education and equality.\"The Nepali doctors said that since India has come up with a new budget, they hope their long struggle for getting stipends will be resolved. \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar. \nThe noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built. Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nNepal national women’s volleyball team suffered their first defeat of the 2024 CAVA Women’s Volleyball Nations League as they lost to a resilient Iran 2-3 at the National Sports Council’s covered hall in Kathmandu on Sunday.Nepal were already assured a place in the semi-finals after Sri Lanka defeated the Maldives in straight sets of 25-22, 25-12, 25-12 earlier in the day.Aruna Shahi’s team also arrived in the evening match brimming with confidence following their historic first ever victory over India.But they were so reckless that they soon found themselves 16-10 behind and by the time they started caution it was already too late. Nepal could not recover and lost the set 25-16, which would cost them dearly.Nepal started the second set strongly and took a 7-0 lead and got back in the game with a dominating 25-16 victory.The hosts were also bright in the third set controlling the game 7-2 but Iran showed a remarkable recovery to level the set 9-9 before winning the competitive contest 25-23.Nepal gathered themselves up in the fourth set and pushed the contest to a deciding fifth set with a comfortable 25-15 win.But Iran floored Nepal with a calm performance and a disciplined defence, winning the fifth set 15-13.The victory gave Iran seven points from four games.Nepal have six points and a match in hand. They play the Maldives, who have already exited the competition after a three-match winless run, on Monday.India have seven points and play Sri Lanka, on four points, in their last league game, also on Monday. \nNepal's national women's volleyball team defeats India for the first time in their history, putting them in contention for a semi-final spot in the CAVA Women's Volleyball Nations League.\nBangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled the country on Monday after hundreds of people were killed in a crackdown on demonstrations that began as protests against job quotas and swelled into a movement demanding her downfall.Jubilant, cheering crowds stormed into the opulent grounds of the presidential residence unopposed, carrying out looted furniture and TVs. One man balanced a red velvet, gilt-edged chair on his head. Another held an armful of vases.Elsewhere in Dhaka, protesters climbed atop a statue of Hasina's father, state founder Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, and began chiselling away at the head with an axe.The flight into exile ended a 15-year second stint in power for Hasina, who has ruled for 20 of the last 30 years as leader of the political movement inherited from her father, assassinated with most of his family in a 1975 coup.Army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman announced Hasina's resignation in a televised address to the nation and said an interim government would be formed. He called for peace and promised justice for those killed in weeks of unrest.He said he had held talks with leaders of major political parties - excluding Hasina's long-ruling Awami League - and would soon meet President Mohammed Shahabuddin to discuss the way ahead.India's ANI news agency said Hasina, 76, landed at a military airfield near Delhi. Reuters could not immediately verify this, but commercial tracking services showed a Bangladesh Air Force plane leaving the country and flying west before it disappeared.“The country is going through a revolutionary period,” said Zaman, 58, who had taken over as army chief only on June 23.“I promise you all, we will bring justice to all the murders and injustice. We request you to have faith in the army of the country. I take full responsibility and I assure you to not get disheartened,” he said. “I request you all to be a little patient, give us some time and together we will be able to solve all the problems,” Zaman added. “Please don't go back to the path of violence and please return to non-violent and peaceful ways.”Bangladesh has been engulfed by violence since student protests last month against the quotas, which reserve some public sector jobs for veterans of Bangladesh's 1971 independence war, seen as favouring allies of the ruling party.The protests escalated into a campaign demanding the overthrow of Hasina, and were met by a violent crackdown in which about 250 people have been killed and thousands injured.She had won a fourth straight term only in January this year in an election boycotted by the main opposition party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party of her nemesis Begum Khaleda Zia.Hasina had ruled since winning a decades-long power struggle with Zia in 2009. The two women each inherited political movements from slain rulers - in Hasina's case, from her father Mujib; in Zia's case, from her husband Ziaur Rahman, who took power after Mujib's death and was himself assassinated in 1981.“Hasina’s resignation proves the power of the people,” said Tarique Rahman, the exiled eldest son of the two Zias who now serves as acting chairman of the opposition party.“Together, let’s rebuild Bangladesh into a democratic and developed nation, where the rights and freedoms of all people are protected,” he posted on X.WEEKS OF PROTESTS, VIOLENCEStudent activists had called for a march to the capital Dhaka on Monday in defiance of a nationwide curfew to press Hasina to resign after clashes across the country on Sunday killed nearly 100 people.On Monday, at least six people were killed in clashes between police and protesters in the Jatrabari and Dhaka Medical College areas, the Daily Star newspaper reported. Reuters could not verify the report.Sunday's death toll, which included at least 13 policemen, was the highest for a single day from any protests in Bangladesh's recent history, surpassing the 67 deaths reported on July 19 when students took to the streets against the quotas.Last month, at least 150 people were killed and thousands injured in violence touched off by student groups protesting against the job quotas.The government declared the indefinite nationwide curfew starting at 6 pm. (1200 GMT) on Sunday and also announced a three-day general holiday starting from Monday.Over the weekend, there have been attacks, vandalism and arson targeting government buildings, offices of Hasina's Awami League party, police stations and houses of public representatives, local media reported. Bangladesh Railway said it had suspended all services indefinitely due to the escalating violence. Garment factories in the country, which supply apparel to some of world's top brands, have also been closed indefinitely.The role of the country's army in tackling the violence had come into focus with a group of retired military officers urging Hasina to withdraw troops from the streets and undertake “political initiatives” to resolve the crisis.Critics of Hasina, along with human rights groups, have accused her government of using excessive force against protesters, a charge she and her ministers deny.Hasina had said that “those who are carrying out violence are not students but terrorists who are out to destabilise the nation”. \nJuddha Shumsher Rana founded the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden in 1932, featuring a diverse collection of animals including elephants, tigers, rhinoceroses, monkeys, birds, and even lions, and serving as both an entertainment venue and a private sanctuary for the prime minister.\nNepali book market is flooded with unauthorized translations of international bestsellers, violating copyright laws, harming authors, and diminishing the quality of literature available to Nepali readers.\nBharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality’s ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via ‘tallo bato’—backdoor route—and that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal. \nNepal's recent Monetary Policy, praised for its expansionary measures, has led to a 4.4% surge in the stock market, particularly due to the removal of margin-loan cap for institutional investors, raising concerns about excessive leverage and the potential for speculative mania.\nThe Annual Kathmandu Conference on Nepal and the Himalaya, organized by Social Science Baha, showcased diverse research presentations from scholars on themes related to Nepal, the Himalayas, and society.\nThe prime minister and several ministers keep on asking: Since the quota reform has already been implemented, why are the students still demonstrating? The repetition of this question only proves how blind to facts and disconnected with the people the government and Awami League leaders are. They are denying or seem to be oblivious to the fact that over 200 killed—the government itself admits to 150—and thousands injured by the indiscriminate firing by the police and Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) has totally changed the situation. In one eye hospital in Dhaka, during the violence, nearly 400 people who sustained eye injuries were treated, 300 of whom had to be admitted, and 250 had to undergo eye surgery. The majority of them had pellet (a particular type of ammunition used by police during the recent violence) wounds in one or both eyes. Imagine what the total figure could be like. We have no count yet of how many will have to amputate one or both arms or legs due to gunshots, and how many more will have to be operated upon. How many will really return to normal life? Everything points to mindless violence that cannot be termed as police action to quell unrest that emanates from usual demonstrations in our part of the world. The evidence is of a mindset of \"shoot at sight,\" as announced by an AL leader.Today's issue is seeking justice. Justice for the massacre of students and other citizens, the unleashing of a killing machine that the police and BGB turned out to be, the large-scale arrests, the \"block raids,\" the house-to-house search, the false cases, and the insults of terming the demonstrators in general to be agents of destruction and anti-Bangladesh forces.The all-encompassing issue that has alienated the students and enraged the people is the atmosphere of fear under which all students, youth, politically involved citizens, and people in general are having to live. (A father called this author and said, \"I have a school-going son. I become tense with every sound of a car stopping near my house at night\".) The killings definitely stand as the most brutal retaliation by a government on any civic movement in the post-liberation Bangladesh history—and may be that of the subcontinent. We shudder at the thought of how a civilian government could allow its law enforcers to attack its own people with such brutality. The killing was not just an event, but one that took place over several days. Wasn't there any reflection, any afterthought and reassessment at the end of the first, second or third day that such heartless and continuous killing of one's own people must stop?What brought the party that led us during the Liberation War to this? Over 15 years of unaccountable power, greed, cronyism, wealth accumulation, abuse of authority, and the attitude that they are above the law.Of all the deaths, the most heart-rending is perhaps the story of Riya Gope, a six-year-old in Nayamati, Narayanganj, who was playing on the rooftop of their four-storey building. On July 19 afternoon, when police started firing on the demonstrators on the street near her house, her father Dipak Kumar Gope rushed to the roof to get her; he was carrying his daughter back to their flat when a bullet struck the child's head. She died at the Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH) on July 25. How could a bullet hit someone on the roof of a four-storey building unless the police took an aim to do so? Was Riya a threat? The explanation will most likely be that it was an accident. But can that be acceptable when she was in her father's arms on the roof of a four-storey building?Use of helicopters to fire sound grenades and tear gas shells is a new element we saw in crowd-handling by the law enforcers this time around. However, there are disturbing accounts from the public, reporters and especially photographers that rifle shots were fired from these helicopters upon demonstrating crowds. On July 18 and 19, around mid-morning, helicopters hovered over Mayor Hanif Flyover, Shanir Akhra, Kajla and Signboard areas, sometimes sweeping down as they flew and fired on the crowd gathered below. These helicopters were clearly marked with the insignia of our law enforcers.The case of Sumaiya Akter in Narayanganj adds credibility to this claim. She was 20 years old and the mother of a healthy two-month-old daughter. Hearing the sound of the helicopter and that of the clashes going on outside, following her mother, Sumaiya ventured out to the veranda of her sixth floor apartment to see what was going on. She got hit by a live bullet and died soon after. Where could the bullet come from? Given the height and the location of the apartment, the most likely possibility is that the shot came from a helicopter, as claimed by her family. This gives substance to claims by many others that they saw gunshots coming from helicopters.How can a protesting crowd be fired upon from the air by their own government? Firing from helicopters is known to occur only when operating in an \"enemy\" territory or a location captured by armed terrorists. How can our own BGB or Rab or police fire upon our own people in such a manner?We demand a credible and thorough investigation on the use of helicopters and their firing on demonstrators. While the judicial investigation to probe all deaths should continue, a separate and fast-track probe must be conducted to reveal the truth on this specific matter.It must also be investigated as to what led to such a large-scale killing in the hands of law enforcers. Who made the threat assessment, and how? At what stage were they allowed to open fire on demonstrators, and who gave the orders to shoot? The rifles used were all modern and sophisticated. BGB used weapons meant to protect our borders. How could they be allowed to tackle student demonstrators with the same weapons? The investigation should also consider whether or not excessive force and disproportionate firepower were used against the demonstrators, none of whom have so far been seen to carry firearms. They were all carrying sticks and iron rods.It is our considered view that the government and the ruling party continue to live in their own bubble and underestimate the depth of the people's grievances that has resulted from the killings of students and the public. We also feel that peace will not return to the campuses and the streets until justice is done and convincingly seen to be done. Force can be used to \"calm\" the situation, but it will be temporary. The lengthier the period of uncertainty, the more grievous will be its impact on our economy and the country's international acceptability.Those who are used to using power to get their way are usually not aware of its limits. We have used Ansar, police, Rab, BGB and even the army, and an extreme measure like curfew. What has been the result? Yes, brutality, death, arrests and harassment can be further ratcheted up. But all that will generate more resentment, deeper hatred, and critical desperation. Such use of force may, at best, show a superficial show of calm, but will never solve our real problem of \"power corrupting and absolute power corrupting absolutely\" (adopting Lord Acton's time-honoured observation).We urge the government to no longer hide behind convenient narratives that stand totally contradicted by facts. We further urge them to examine the brutality with which the demonstrators have been treated and the death and injuries that ordinary students and the people have had to suffer, and respond to the call for justice. We also urge them to stop befooling themselves as facts are in people's hands due to modern technology. Yes, there could be a lot of false news and videos in the digital sphere. But there are many credible ones too. Wisdom should compel the government not to brush them aside, which it will do only at its own peril.-The Daily Star (Bangladesh)/ANN \nTwo swept-away buses in the roaring Trishuli River remain untraced, revealing insufficient disaster preparedness, necessitating heightened vigilance, skilled rescuers, and community-level mobilization.\nNepal's Parliamentary Hearing Committee rejected the appointment of Krishna Man Pradhan as election commissioner due to sexual exploitation allegations, highlighting the importance of the committee's scrutiny despite the Constitutional Council's recommendation.\nNepali students are flocking to Japan for higher education due to its affordability and work-study options, but the nation should focus on building a global network of Nepalis and fostering collaboration to harness their potential.\nAjaya Dixit’s current work focuses on studying challenges of building resilience across boundaries and at sub-national scales. He has studied and written extensively on water resources, trans-boundary water cooperation, flood management, wash services and climate change adaptation, clean energy transition and related policy studies. In this interview with the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal, Dixit discusses river management in Nepal’s urban areas: Where have we gone wrong in this endeavour and what can we do? You have extensively studied river systems and have been following changes seen in river basins. How do you see recent problems caused by encroachment and rampant development activities?We humans have lived and have to continue to live within water cycles: water evaporates from the ocean to the sky and then precipitates to the land and flows via rivers back to the ocean. Rivers that function as arteries of the land surface, sustaining humans, aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems face widespread abuses: pollution, rampant extraction of their bed and banks, fragmentation and degradation. Without rivers, we would not be who we are. Unfortunately, we have forgotten this essence. We neglect and abuse rivers. In 1981, just after the monsoon ended, I, along with my students, walked from Sundarijal to Teku studying Bagmati rivers’ sediment. At many places, we walked on the riverbed. The river then was clean. Gradually, the river systems began to face all-round decay. I have read painful accounts of my contemporaries who remember swimming in the clean Bagmati and its tributaries. In less than 50 years, our rivers in Kathmandu Valley and other basins no longer look like rivers. I feel helpless and ache with pain at this collective failure! What state of rivers are we passing on to our next generation?River encroachment is common across Nepal but more serious in urban areas, including in Kathmandu. How can this be stopped?Our approach to rivers is an imitation of the trend common across South Asia, or the subcontinent, which is again largely based on the knowledge system developed in the industrialised Global North without contextualising locally. The region features waterscapes of high and punctuated rainfall during the monsoon months, rivers, wetlands, ponds, and springs, all connected with groundwater aquifers in one of the most complex landscapes of the world: the Himalaya-Ganga region. Yet, current development endeavours subjugate water rather than respect and live with it. In 2022, the Indus River in Pakistan faced major floods with devastating consequences. Referring to these floods, a group of global scientists stated that “the impacts [of the floods] were the outcome of an outdated river management system.” This approach is primarily based on building of physical structures such as buildings, bridges and roads close to rivers interfering with their natural flows. The approach that began in the early twentieth century keeps marching on even while we are facing twenty first century water challenges.There is an increasing trend of building corridor roads along the rivers in Kathmandu as well as other places. Is this a good or bad practice? In Nepal, road building in the hills has earned the sobriquet of “dozer roads,” meaning politically designed roads excavated by heavy machine operators without adhering to basic engineering, social, environmental, or hydrological safeguards. Even highways built with “engineering,” such as the Mugling-Narayanghat section, face regular accidents. The sliding of the two buses in the Trishuli is the recent example. Building roads along the banks of rivers, defined as “river corridors,” is the preferred approach for improving connectivity. In the Kathmandu Valley, this is also associated with rivers shackled within concrete walls in the name of river beautification. In the monsoon, however, they all overflow as we have been seeing in the last few years and this year as well.What will happen to these rivers 10-15 years down the line? Is there any chance of some of our rivers dying? Or, will the measures taken in recent times protect them?All rivers must flow clean and free in selected stretches. But today, rivers are disconnected with their floodplains. Within walls and embankments, they have become conduits of filth. Many rivers are already seriously degraded. If the current trend continues, many rivers may die. I remember Jacques-Yves Cousteau, the French oceanographer, filmmaker, and author, who wrote: “Water and air, the two essential fluids on which all life depends, have become global garbage cans.” Our current efforts at conserving, developing and managing rivers are grossly inadequate. During the Covid-19 pandemic, we saw some rivers heal as human actions across the board ceased due to the lockdown. But this healing came at huge human and economic costs. The lessons, however, are clear. We must stop turning rivers into garbage cans for them to begin to heal. The onus lies on us, our activities, our governance, and the policies we make and put into practice effectively. We need new ways of imagining rivers in harmony with human needs. Otherwise, the rivers will die. If rivers die, what will become of us?What problems may city dwellers face as a result of this continued destruction of rivers?A 2020 analysis of rivers in Nepal found that the quality of rivers in the mid-hills and the Tarai are already deteriorating. Industries, cities, towns, and agriculture produce waste that, when disposed of in rivers untreated, cause pollution. Solid and liquid wastes produced by expanding cities and towns pollute nearby rivers, streams, and water bodies. Pollution kills aquatic life such as fish, which are sources of livelihood for many communities. Polluted rivers and water bodies degrade human and environmental health, leading to negative impacts on human livelihoods. The impacts of pollution on rivers are considerable during non-monsoon months when river discharge, and consequently the capacity of rivers to dilute waste, are low.What should be done to conserve the rivers, at least in the present form, and stop further damages?All rivers are a combination of water (W), energy (E), biodiversity aquatic (B), and sediment (S), represented by the acronym WEBS. In the current scheme of things, the focus is on water and energy. Aquatic ecosystems are the concern of only those working on freshwater ecosystems. They are neglected in the larger context though the state has made some provisions for conserving ecosystems. In Nepal’s Hydropower Development Policy of 2001 all hydropower plants must release 10 percent minimum flow to the downstream reaches to enable fish and other aquatic life to survive in the river. A 2021 study of 50 hydropower plants however found that none of the plants surveyed release environmental-flows. All hydropower plants, as per their power purchasing agreements, are required to produce maximum power during the dry season. We should start by accepting the fact that rivers need clean flowing water and respecting the policies we have made. Then we must systematically introduce changes and avoid the oversights embedded in the present approach. The present approach to water development and management focused on engineering and structural solutions is based on single-disciplinary education that is blind to gender and social inclusion challenges and aquatic ecosystems. In the present approach, nobody seems to want sediment which is a natural consequence of flow within the water cycle.To meet such an objective, we need to begin with a system of integrated knowledge that synthesises natural science, social science, and indigenous practices. By incorporating fields such as hydrology, ecology, social science-supported context-specific engineering, and indigenous knowledge and practices, we can take a comprehensive approach to water management challenges and solutions. Interdisciplinary approaches can build collaboration, innovation, and systemic decision-making and promote innovative water management for the benefit of both ecosystems and human societies.Do you think initiatives such as river clean up campaigns run by various groups help protect these waterways?I see such initiatives as manifestation of dissatisfaction of concerned citizens with the degradation of rivers and to bring about changes. In 1990, I was part of the Save Bagmati Campaign, which aimed to highlight the degrading state of the river. This campaign has taken many new forms, and citizen groups have begun campaigns in other rivers of Nepal. They however remain fragmented and ad-hoc. Similar campaigns in some countries have led to granting rights to rivers. In 2017, New Zealand recognised the Whanganui River and its tributaries as legal entities, acknowledging their physical and spiritual significance as “living and indivisible” and ensuring their survival, health, and integrity to balance the needs of humans and nature. Promulgations like Living Indus (Pakistan), Namami Gange river-improvement programme (India) can offer lessons for a holistic water journey. The collective voice of concerned citizens for the integrity of rivers can be a powerful medium for policy and pathway changes. Nepal must also begin country-wide river restoration initiatives. We need more dialogue and conservation around water challenges and solutions.As cities turn into concrete jungles, their water tables are said to be receding alarmingly. You often propose redesigning our settlements and development infrastructure in a way that wouldn’t disturb rivers’ natural courses and catchment areas. Could you elaborate?South Asia is a region of waterscapes containing streams, ponds, wetlands, open spaces, floodplains, springs, and underground aquifers. Yet, our towns, cities, and infrastructure are planned, designed, and built to disregard water rather than live with it. As land-centric urban growth dominates, waterscapes temporarily seem to vanish but later water comes back. In Nepali we have a saying “In twelve years a stream returns”. The present practice of urban development is obsessed with concretisation, making these areas impermeable. Rainwater, part of which would naturally infiltrate the ground, now immediately reaches the rivers already constrained by walls. The river at a downstream section immediately peaks and when the rainfall stops the river has very low discharge. Basic parameters, like the intensity of rainfall (mm per hour), are poorly recognised and used in design guidelines. The interaction of current urbanisation practices and increasing extreme rainfall, temperature and humidity rise spawned by climate change and urban heat island effects will make our urban areas as crucible of hazards, and unhealthy. A new urban future must harmoniously integrate nature, including water bodies and wetlands, and preserve natural land cover, including traditional ponds to promote groundwater recharge. It can be further achieved by preserving green open spaces, forests, gardens, permeable “sponge” pavements, and natural waterfronts for healthier communities in sustainable cities. The starting point will be recognising cities as waterscapes. Amplified mitigation of emissions of greenhouse gases at global levels remains a critical imperative in this new future. The major impacts of climate change are evident through the water cycle. Squatters settled along the riverbanks are taken as one of the major headaches in preserving rivers’ catchment areas. How can this issue be resolved?The squatters and migrants to urban regions are outcomes of the present-day political economy of development. People move to cities seeking livelihood, education, and opportunities to move up the social ladder. These groups who end up living in high-risk areas are sometimes also seen as political vote banks. This issue needs to be viewed within the larger development question including generation of local employment, new livelihood opportunities and addressing insecurities of water, food, health, and education.Recently the Supreme Court asked authorities to make septic tank and soak pit mandatory while approving building designs in order to help recharge groundwater, and a recent Cabinet meeting has banned building any structure within 40 metres on both sides of major rivers in Kathmandu, Do such measures help keep the rivers alive or is that too little too late?Such decisions, in some way, seem to underscore the notion of giving space to rivers and maintaining their integrity. Building of septic tanks as part and parcel of new houses began in the 1970s as primary treatment units that can prevent the direct dumping of human waste into rivers and water bodies. The regular cleaning and safe disposal of waste from septic tanks are emerging questions. Rivers and waterscapes face much deeper challenges, however. The present water development model marches on like a mighty tusker, trampling in its path communities, villagers, residents, natural ecosystems, the terrestrial and aquatic beings, and past memories. Turning that around will require those working on water and river integrity across geographical, social, disciplinary and political boundaries to join hands in seeking changes and laying the foundation for a new ethical social contract for rivers and waterscapes as a first step in that long journey. \nWithin days of CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli and Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba reaching a deal to form a new government under Oli’s leadership, some Congress leaders including the two party general secretaries started doubting the deal’s implementation. Independent observers also have doubts over the longevity of the Congress-UML partnership. To get some insight, the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Congress Central Committee member Govind Raj Pokharel, who is also former vice-chair of National Planning Commission. Many have expressed doubt over the longevity of the Congress-UML alliance. What is your observation?There was a discussion in the political circles on the need for the Congress and the UML joining hands to address some serious problems the country has been facing for years. The issues of governance, flaws seen in the practice of the electoral system, and the national economy are some pressing issues that need to be addressed. In the meantime, the top leaders of the two largest parties reached a deal overnight. The dramatic turn of events made people suspect some unspoken reasons had brought the leaders of the two rival forces together. The leaders have stated that they joined hands mainly to review the constitution, to make changes in the electoral system, improve governance and address problems seen in the economic sector. These are the stated objectives. As far as my observation goes, people don’t have full faith in the leaders of the two parties because of past records. On the economic front, this coalition may achieve some improvements because both parties are on the same page. Both follow liberal economic ideas. Of late, even the UML has become increasingly liberal on economic issues. The private sector has welcomed the new alliance. There are already some signs of reforms. Their plan to make changes in the electoral system through constitutional amendment however is not easy. First, their numerical strength in the federal parliament, mainly in the upper house, is insufficient to amend the constitution. Such a move would be risky from a strategic perspective as well. Many groups and forces have reservations over various provisions of this constitution. Once they start the amendment process, it will be like opening Pandora’s Box. Thus I am optimistic only on the economic front. If they get that right, it will help address the society’s mass frustration.The two parties have cited the perennial political instability as a major reason behind their coming together. Can we now expect policy consistency as well?Political instability is an excuse to cover up their failures. Even the alliance of largest parties cannot guarantee political or policy stability. Numbers alone are not enough. Leaders also need to have a democratic culture and the capacity to manage emerging issues. Even governments led by a single party commanding up to two-thirds majority have failed. On certain occasions, coalition governments have done commendable jobs. Handling the post-quake situation and producing the constitution in 2015 were examples of big parties justifying their coalition. Thus even with some doubt, we can expect political stability and some economic reforms.The Congress unanimously endorsed the deal of party president Sher Bahadur Deuba and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli. But in public, leaders from the anti-establishment faction of the Congress don’t seem satisfied. Why this unease?The deal was made in a dramatic way without proper consultations with other leaders. At least those in the executive committees of the party should have been consulted. It is challenging for the Congress leaders to ally with their major rival, the UML. A cadre-based party, the UML’s style of governance is different to that of the Congress. When in government, the UML treats even government institutions, constitutional bodies and independent agencies as the party’s structures. Whereas the Congress allows more freedom to government agencies. So, there is a risk of the UML misusing state mechanisms while the Congress leaders are in the Cabinet. This is one big risk for the Congress. The second concern is the working style of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli. He is a towering personality, a hard-working leader, and with his strong command over his party organisation, he can swiftly implement any proposal. The Congress ministers who also have to listen to the concerns of the party’s top leaders may struggle to strike a balance. In Oli’s Cabinet, ministers are likely to get less freedom within their ministries. A rift is thus likely because of Prime Minister Oli’s working style.Why didn’t the Congress then send influential leaders to the Cabinet to check the prime minister?The leaders might not have been so interested in joining this government. They might have sensed intervention from the prime minister’s office and thought they might not be able to perform as per their expectation under Oli’s leadership. See, chiefs of the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre work in a dictatorial way. Once they are elected at the party convention for four years, they behave like dictators. They take decisions on their own without any consultations. People in Nepal often lobby for a directly-elected prime minister or President. I wonder what these leaders would do if they were directly elected as executive head. So, the problem is in the working style and attitude of our leaders, not in the constitution or the electoral system.Shekhar Koirala and Gagan Thapa had first pitched for joining hands with the UML to end ‘unnecessary bargaining’ of fringe parties. Suddenly, Deuba struck the deal with Oli. And, now Koirala and Thapa seem sceptical about the deal.The proposal of Koirala and Thapa was for Congress leading the government and the UML supporting it. In fact, Oli was ready to accept Congress leadership. He requested the Congress leaders to take the lead. Surprisingly, the negotiating team led by our party president reached an opposite deal. They offered government leadership to Oli.Then, could it be that, as some claim, Deuba and his wife Arzu were desperate to unseat Dahal fearing they could be dragged into corruption scams?I don’t know much about that scenario. But what I knew is that Oli was willing to join a Congress-led government.Why would Deuba, who is a very clever leader in making such give-and-take deals, have given up a chance to be prime minister right away?It’s true that all three party chiefs—Deuba, Oli and Dahal—are very clever in making deals in their own favour based on their numerical strength. A leader beats the other two on one occasion and on another, another of them comes out on top. It’s like a see-saw. This time Oli won the game.Congress General Secretaries Gagan Thapa and Bishwa Prakash Sharma have expressed suspicion over the implementation of the deal. Many say they did so as Deuba didn’t involve them in negotiations on power-sharing. Is it true?The party’s central work execution committee endorsed the deal signed by the two leaders. The leaders who participate in such meetings should speak up then and there if there is anything objectionable, instead of making such statements in public. Why didn’t they oppose it at the meeting? I don’t see any point in expressing doubt over the deal in public while endorsing the same in party committees.The two general secretaries also expressed doubt over Oli handing over government leadership to Deuba as per the agreement. Why this mistrust?The experience of the past two or three decades makes politicians suspicious of each other. Nepali politicians have hardly ever handed over government leadership easily. After four or five months of collaboration, some issues emerge and a rift is created. So, history makes us doubt that this coalition will last for three and half years. In the meantime, the party establishments have sidelined other factions when it comes to picking ministers, both at federal and provincial levels. When the government fails to perform as per expectation, party cadres of the ruling parties start criticising the government. Is it possible to amend the constitution as the two parties have announced?We can’t backtrack on the inclusive system. We must abide by the policy of inclusion in state agencies. The leaders who spoiled this system are saying that the proportional representation (PR) system is not working. But there is room to make our three-tier federal system more cost-effective. People get irritated when they see a large number of representatives benefitting from state coffers. We can bring down the number of local units from 753 to around 400. However, there should be sufficient wards as those units are directly involved in service delivery while the Palikas are more engaged in development activities. The number of ward members can also be decreased. In provinces, we don’t need PR seats as those elected from the provincial constituencies automatically represent the local communities. Likewise, the provincial cabinets can be downsized. Thus we can downsize the number of people who benefit from state coffers. This is vital to make the federal system sustainable. Similarly, we can rightsize the number of PR seats by adopting a rotational constituency for women, dalits and other marginalised communities. Only the candidates from underrepresented sections will compete in those constituencies. This will help elect competent people even from within the targeted communities. This is how we can address some concerns without compromising the inclusive system envisioned in the constitution.Why has the Congress picked gangsters and tainted individuals as ministers in provinces?The selection of such controversial individuals as ministers and policy makers will damage the party’s image. People are going to raise this issue seriously. In fact the pace of criminalisation and commercialisation of Nepali politics is faster than the political reform being undertaken to clean up politics.It seems intellectual leaders are being sidelined while gangsters are being promoted. Why is it happening?Because people from intellectual or political backgrounds voice critical views and leaders don’t like it. They speak what their conscience says is right. For instance, leaders like Mahesh Acharya and Minendra Rijal aren’t given any role in the party. It is a common problem in all the major political forces in Nepal.Is the space for leaders with intellectual backgrounds and having critical views being squeezed?The Congress used to be a very liberal organisation. But it has also become illiberal and leaders have become increasingly intolerant. All leaders—whether the seniors or young ones—are becoming less tolerant even of constructive criticism. Party leaders haven’t spoken against the selection of gangsters as ministers. Even the office bearers who are in decision making bodies and can change the decisions are silent now. This is dangerous. This is an example of how critical voices are sidelined.Haven’t the two young general secretaries been able to raise hope in the Congress?They are working like central committee members. General secretaries should be able to intervene while making crucial policy decisions. They can stop the party committees from making wrong decisions. But they are risk-averse. They are not taking the risk to fight the powerful party establishment.Historically, in all parties there is a trend of its anti-establishment faction bargaining for 40-45 percent seats in the party or government. If they don’t get an acceptable power sharing deal, they don’t cooperate with the party leadership. Is it a healthy democratic practice?Intra-party competition compels the leaders to do this. The ruthless establishment always sidelines party members and leaders if they aren’t loyal. So, the leadership of the anti-establishment has to protect such cadres because the rival factor too needs a strong support base of cadres to compete against the powerful establishment. Party establishments are strong due to centralised resources and other factors, so you need an equally strong force to compete against them. \nScores of people have been killed in landslides, floods and other monsoon-induced disasters within a month of the monsoon entering Nepal in the second week of June. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asks Jagadishwor Karmacharya, director general of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, what the department is doing to save people from disasters and whether our system is ready to cope with the challenges posed by climate change.Where is Nepal in terms of technology and expertise when it comes to forecasting the ever-changing weather patterns?If we compare to our situation a decade ago, we have made significant progress in setting up meteorological stations, collecting real-time data and increasing the frequency of weather predictions. We get rainfall data from around 350 stations, while we receive information about temperature and other related parameters from around 150 stations. We have an additional 175 centres to collect information about water levels. Our servers get real-time data every 10 minutes from all these stations. Besides that, we also have manual data collection centres. Thus, we have around 800 data collection centres in total. But we haven’t been able to set up enough stations in the Himalayan range due to difficult topography, low presence of government agencies and other factors. Also, we release radiosonde balloons to collect data on temperature, humidity and wind speed from the upper levels of the atmosphere. Overall, we have made huge strides in using technologies in the past decade, but it is still insufficient to cater to people’s expectations. They want specific weather information about their present location or destination. The expectation is valid. But our complex and diverse topography and meteorological phenomenon—ranging from the Tarai belt to the Himalayan range—makes accurate forecasts challenging. Kaski’s Lumle sees maximum rainfall in the country, and around 40 km north of it, the Jomsom area sees negligible rain. So great variability within a short distance adds to the challenge of forecasting.Do we have sufficient stations to cater to that variability?We need more stations because the higher you go, the more variabilities you find. In the plains, the weather pattern is more homogenous, while it is highly heterogeneous in the hills. In Tarai, even a station in around 100-150 kilometres may work because there is less variability of temperature as well as rainfall. But we need more stations in the hills where rain patterns drastically change.Are our methods and technologies being updated over time?Until around a decade ago, the forecasters used to predict based on their experience and the data received every three hours from the synoptic weather stations of Nepal and other neighbouring countries. At the time, we used to predict weather only for a day. Now, we synthesise the data collected from our systems and those from the modelling centres from India, China and other countries. Now, we can forecast for three days.Our capacity has significantly increased mainly in observing real time happenings. As I said, we take updates from hundreds of stations every 10 minutes. We also take satellite pictures from 16 channels of Japan’s Himawari Satellite, which has stationed its receiver in Nepal as well, also every 10 minutes. Until over a decade ago, we used to receive satellite pictures just once or twice a day. Even those pictures weren’t as good as those we get these days. We used to update surface-related data in three hours and upper air data in 12 hours. Based on that, we made a weather forecast for the next 12 hours. In comparison, we now have a large number of hydrological and meteorological real-time observation stations, the updates from Himawari and other satellites every 10 minutes and we have three radars to gather information. With the help of these technologies, now we can get immediate real-time updates. It helps us analyse the data of past hours and predict possible scenarios of the next six to 12 hours. We inform people accordingly. But we have to work more on the technology to make longer forecasts. Despite these progresses, we are still 15-20 years back in comparison to the technologies used by developed countries. We are behind in research. We need more expertise and an upgrade of our technology. Nepal doesn’t have its own satellite. Is this problematic?On the weather observation part, our work has not been hampered because we get data from the satellites of India, China and Japan. On the communication part, we are getting support from telecom companies—NTC and NCell—to transfer data. It covers most parts of the country. Absence of a satellite of our own is less of a concern compared to our other needs.Climate change has brought about massive changes in weather patterns. Do we have sufficient expertise to cope with this?The organisational structure and positions in our department haven’t changed much in over three decades. Demand for our work has drastically increased in the past two decades but we haven’t been able to cater to the demand. We need engineers capable of working with the latest technologies but we don’t have positions for such professionals in our current structure. We have procured some technologies and got some from our donors. But we don’t even have experts to use that as well.As you said, the department has made progress in the past decade but in this period climate change has progressed even faster. How do we keep up with this change?We face new challenges almost every year. In the past couple of years, mountain districts such as Manang and Mustang have not only witnessed rainfalls but also heavy downpours that even swept away bridges and other structures. Last year, over 30 hydropower projects were badly damaged by floods in eastern Nepal. The floods that wreaked havoc in Melamchi in 2021 were unprecedented. These incidents are evidence that climate change has already started to show unusual patterns and cause damages in this Himalayan range. We will face extreme weather patterns like long droughts and heavy rainfalls.The Dodhara weather station of Kanchanpur recorded 624mm of rainfall in 24 hours earlier this month. This is a new record. Before that, 540mm was the highest rainfall recorded, around two decades ago. Upward shifting of snowline in the mountains and formation of glacial lakes are other indications of the impacts of climate change. Don’t you think it’s already late to restructure government agencies, review policies and even redesign our systems?That is necessary. Devastation in Melamchi is one example that suggests the same. While developing such projects, we have to seriously consider possible impacts of climate change. Even if they analyse the possible scenario, they refer to the data of the past few decades. But things are changing so fast, decisions based on old data might not be useful. So, it is becoming more challenging to make projections. Design guidelines definitely need to be updated. Our division lacks policies, let alone updated ones. Though we are issuing red alerts and carrying out other tasks on scientific grounds, we don’t have a legal basis even to do these things.A large number of people in Nepal die in floods and landslides every year. Can we tweak our forecast system to save more lives?We have succeeded in reducing the deaths by floods in comparison to the loss we used to incur until 8-10 years ago. Earlier, we didn’t have flood alert service. It has been around a decade since we started the dedicated flood service. These days, we send mass SMS to the people of areas where floods may cause damage and for that we collaborate with telecoms—NTC and Ncell. We also work with district authorities and I/NGOs mainly in flood-prone districts to run campaigns and conduct drills. This has been quite effective. We are also taking similar initiatives in collaboration with telecom companies and other agencies to inform people on 13 various hydro-meteorological hazards such as, rains, lightning, winds.Working on floods is comparatively easier as it has certain catchment areas and we can focus on specific areas. So our efforts yield results. But in other incidents we can’t focus on certain areas. In floods, we inform the people hours before the flood so that they can shift to safe places. In the past, the death toll from floods used to be the highest. Now there are more deaths from landslides and lightning. We need to work more to give accurate information on lightning as well. Landslides vulnerability has increased due to extreme weather patterns, the impact of 2015 earthquake and rampant road construction.Why don’t people in Nepal follow and rely on weather forecasts? Is it due to negligence or lack of reliability of the prediction?It might be both. If the forecast doesn’t match reality, they may not follow or rely on us. So we need to improve our accuracy. Secondly, we need to increase awareness. Moreover, the weather isn’t as predictable as it used to be. So, we should keep on working, improving accuracy and making people aware. Many rely on international forecasts but not our own. Is our system less efficient?There are two aspects. One is getting accurate information and the second is user-friendly and attractive visual presentation of data, such as in mobile apps. We lag in the second part. Also, people want specific information about their locality and their intended destination. In the past, we used to give information by dividing the country in major regions such as eastern, central, western parts, tarai and hills. Now we have narrowed it down to each district. We need to work more on research.Have we succeeded in connecting weather forecasts to people’s livelihoods?The United Nations has launched the ‘Early Warning For All’ initiative to ensure that everyone on Earth is protected from hazardous weather, water, or climate events through life-saving early warning systems by the end of 2027. Various stakeholders need to join hands to implement it effectively as it has various components. Our expertise is to give as accurate information as we can. We give inputs but there are other agencies that go to the community level and work with the people.What are the things that need to be done in the changed context?We shouldn’t limit our work to simple forecasting but move to impact-based forecasts. For instance, we issue a seven-day Agromet Advisory Bulletin in collaboration with Nepal Agricultural Research Council which includes a summary on weather, crops, livestock, tables on weather and agrometeorological parameters, current weather information along with weather forecast (outlook). In a similar way, we can work with stakeholders on road transport as well. Then, we can make our forecast impactful, connect the general people and win their trust. But that requires proper policies and laws, updating this department’s organisational structure and enhancing the capacity of our human resource. \nThe July 1 midnight deal between the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, the first and the second largest parties in the federal lower house respectively, turned national politics on its head. Pushpa Kamal Dahal was thrown out as prime minister and KP Oli assumed the country’s leadership. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asked Maoist Centre leader Ram Karki, who has cultivated an image of a rebel within the party, on his reading of the event. How do you see the CPN-UML’s rebuffing of the CPN (Maoist Centre) and formation of a new government with the Nepali Congress?If you see it from the perspective of those who believe in parliamentary democracy, this is wrong. In the system, the largest party is believed to have the public mandate to run the government and the second-biggest to be the main opposition. A weak opposition makes for a weak parliamentary system. The system isn’t an ideal one for us [communists]. The two parties have made a mockery of the system they advocate for. Why didn’t the Maoist party that championed progressive agendas implement them when in government?We should admit that we lost the moral authority to implement and execute those agendas. We could have implemented those ideals by mobilising peasants, working-class groups, and people from oppressed communities, but our grip and connection with them have loosened.Why did the party and the leadership distance itself from the working class?The state has two arms—coercive and persuasive. The Maoists succeeded in using coercive force. But you can’t use this all the time. One has to use persuasive force most of the time. When we joined mainstream politics, we were the leading political force. We were in power. At the time we should have changed our education sector. For that, we should have worked on our curriculum and trained teachers. Our educational system is guided by patriarchal and feudal values. We need to orient people to questioning and following science. The party couldn’t do so. Had we done so, we would now have a critical mass with us. The Maoist leaders lost the moral ground. When you preach lofty ideas, the public won’t listen to you. They instead watch your lifestyle. Earlier, the Congress and the UML leaders, who were outsiders in Kathmandu, got ‘polluted’ when they worked in collusion with the capital’s elites. We, too, got ‘polluted’ by hobnobbing with the two parties. The working class and oppressed communities that had helped the Maoist party fight the state felt betrayed. The leaders and the masses are separated now. The Maoist party was the true leader of the progressive agenda such as inclusion, federalism, secularism and republicanism. These ideas are still valid, but the party failed to honour them. It failed because it lost its strength and disconnected itself from the class it fought for. It tried to become the leader of all people. The oppressed communities felt betrayal, while the other classes didn’t accept the party because of our past. Do you think the Congress and the UML will try to undermine progressive agendas enshrined in the new constitution?They have also sold lofty ideas to the people in the past. A counter-revolution under the two parties’ leadership is not easy. Their rank and file won’t accept it. The Congress, in fact, is not only a political party but a collective where you find radical Hindus as well as hardcore secularists. It stays strong as long as it works as a unified force of various groups. But when it imitates communists and tries to be a rigid cadre-based party, it loses its space and strength. So the Congress can’t lead a counter-revolution against progressive ideas. Counter-revolution is not easy, but the reactionary forces have certainly succeeded in regaining their space.Observers and politicians from rival parties claim that the Maoist Centre is now in an existential crisis. Do you think it can make a comeback?More importantly, the space that used to be occupied by the Maoist party is now left unoccupied.Can’t the UML or other forces make inroads into that space?The UML is a tried and tested force. Even the Maoist Centre is now described as a tested force. How can older forces enter that space? A force mightier than the Maoists can emerge. As a Maoist party member, I still vow to rejuvenate and revive the Maoist Centre. I am trying to convince my fellow comrades to do that. But my voice hasn’t prevailed. I have been presenting my papers in the party’s general conventions. We still have a strong belief that sooner or later, we will prevail because we are raising valid issues.Various leftist groups have at various times tried to create a strong, united left political force in Nepal. Do you think ideas like socialism and communism still attract the youth?Some rebel voices within our parties take some initiatives to raise our collective voice to build pressure on party establishments. But this has been limited to theoretical debates and failed to translate into politics. A theory or philosophy is like an iron plate, while crafting a tool from that iron is politics. We haven’t been able to transform our ideas into political action. If a leader floats a political agenda, the people first study the leader’s integrity. If a leader with a strong moral authority proposes an idea, people trust and follow it. If Gandhi was wearing a suit and telling people to wear handwoven khadi, Indian people wouldn’t have followed him. Similarly, if Mao was using clothes, watches and vehicles from developed countries while preaching for simplicity, Chinese people wouldn’t have followed him.Our people don’t listen to our leaders because they don’t see the leaders walk the talk. Youths are always attracted by adventurism; they are receptive and sensitive to certain incidents. Now, they aren’t following us because they don’t find any adventure and newness in our ideas. If we do some soul searching and correct ourselves, the Maoist Centre still can lead the process to complete the unfinished progressive agendas. Is that possible under the current Maoist leadership that has lost its credibility while staying in power for long? Will the people trust them?People will judge them based on their actions. If the Maoist leaders were more credible, there would be no space for the Congress and UML to come together. Either one or the other force would seek the Maoist party’s support. They wouldn’t have dared to ignore the Maoist party that led progressive issues in the recent past. They were emboldened because of the Maoists’ diminishing influence. Therefore, we have to correct ourselves in practice.You said that the classes and communities the Maoist party used to lead now have no leader. Can new outfits occupy that space?The traditional parties—the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre–don’t have any strategic vision on where they want to see the country in 20 years. The new forces are worse. They hit a ball and wherever it reaches, shift the goalpost there. They carry the goalpost with them. New forces with such visions can’t replace old parties. History shows that Nepal has witnessed political upheavals in a gap of 10-15 years. In the past such tsunamis have changed the political systems. Now we have seen sparks of movements but they are scattered. New forces need an ideological weapon. The Maoists forgot to sharpen their ideological weapon over time by holding ideological debates and upgrading themselves. Another is intra-party democracy. A political party that doesn’t practise intra-party democracy can’t enforce democracy in society.From the perspectives of intra-party democracy, the Maoist Centre is probably the most undemocratic of major political forces. Why?In the Congress, you are free to speak, but you don’t have a say in execution. Communist parties are too centralised. The structure conceptualised around a century ago in the context of wars and other contexts hasn’t been updated. Even new parties are run by the party chiefs imitating the anomalies of traditional forces. A leader is praised if s/he takes immediate decisions, gets them endorsed from the party committees and implements them swiftly. Those who say they have to first discuss the issue in party committees are described as weak. Such a trend is killing intra-party democracy.Do you think the Congress-UML coalition will succeed?A coalition between the parties that don’t even have a common minimum programme is a coalition of opportunists. They don’t have a moral ground either. On ideological grounds, the Congress still cites the late BP Koirala because no other leader of the party has worked on the theoretical front for decades. Such is also the situation with communists. They still cite the theoretical works of the late Pushpa Lal Shrestha. The current alliance is not a principled one, it’s a collaboration between opportunists. So, don’t expect anything better.How do you evaluate the outgoing government?It did nothing for the class it represents. The prime minister’s secretariat might have prepared a list of ‘100 important achievements of the government’. But what is the government’s priority? It failed to even give skills to those going abroad in search of work. They would have found better work had we given them valuable skills. Not only the outgoing one but all the previous governments have failed. The Congress-UML alliance has said it wants to review the constitution and amend the charter when necessary. How do you see this idea?This will be backtracking from the present constitutional roadmap. It is dishonest to create hindrance in implementing the federal system and then suggest the system is a burden. Such moves would give space to those who want to raise questions on republic and secular systems. There is a strong faction that lobbies for Hindutwa in the Nepali Congress. It is no secret that the Congress and the UML were not in favour of republic, secular and federal systems. But later, they rode the popular wave. But they have still not internalised it, and there are some regressive elements in both the parties but the people, who have come too far, won’t backtrack.Don’t you think the coming together of Congress and UML may ensure political stability?Instability is okay for me because stability may not necessarily be good for a country like ours. See, a single leader has been ruling a party continuously for over 30 years. What if they rule the country in a similar way? Look at some countries where a single leader has ruled for decades. The current arrangement is better than such stability.Will the Maoist party chairman and prime minister, who didn’t even appoint a minister from a Dalit community, have the moral authority to again champion the agenda of the oppressed?Appointing a minister is again an ornamental approach to appease certain communities. What we should do is ensure the participation of oppressed communities in policymaking.But party chair Dahal may again seek ways to get back to power. Will he pay attention to these issues?We should stop this chase for power at all cost. We will say this in our party meetings. We should accept the reality that we have just 32 seats and so we won’t get sufficient space to implement any important programmes even if we join the government.The way your party chief remained in power for over 18 months using various tactics, was it right?If you see it through a parliamentarian’s lens, it looks quite smart. If you see it through a Marxist perspective, just becoming a prime minister is futile if you can’t implement your policies and strengthen republicanism and participatory democracy. \nThe Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML last week reached an agreement to form a coalition government under the leadership of UML chair KP Sharma Oli. As a part of the package, they also aim to make certain changes to the constitution. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asked Pradeep Gyawali, deputy general secretary of UML, the reasons behind the coming together of the two largest parties, how they plan to run the government and to review and amend the constitution.Many are seeing the Congress-UML alliance as something unusual. What factors brought the two largest parties together even as there is no crisis-like situation or a special task such as constitution writing?Definitely, in normal parliamentary practice, the two largest parties don’t forge an alliance to run a government. The party that gets the biggest mandate leads the government, and the other big party remains in the opposition to make the ruling force accountable. In Nepal, the country’s two major forces, the Congress and the UML, have also joined hands in certain junctures for certain purposes. They worked together to make the constitution in 1990, to conduct general elections in 1999, to complete transition after the 2006 people’s movement and to bring out the constitution in 2015. We felt a need for a similar collaboration this time around. After the November 2022 elections, we saw three alliances in our parliament. At first, Maoist Centre chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal became prime minister with our support, but he failed to abide by the agreement sincerely. He changed the coalition within a month. The subsequent alliance between the Congress and the Maoist Centre lasted for a year. He again sought the UML’s support. Within four months of the March 4 deal with the UML, he started yet another gameplan to join hands with the Congress under the pretext of forming a national consensus government. It was quite unusual for the prime minister himself to instigate instability in the government. He publicly boasted that he had a ‘magical number’ [32 seats in the House of Representatives]. He thought that he could employ the tactic of ‘use and throw’ with the two largest parties and rule the country for the full term. He was completely indifferent to people’s plight, the country’s pressing issues and service delivery. This was the height of irresponsibility. So, the UML and Congress leaders concluded that the time had come to intervene to ensure political stability and service delivery and make sure public frustration doesn’t get out of hand. Did external factors play a role? Recent statements by UML leaders suggest that the party has taken it seriously. When national forces are weak, the neighbouring countries and international forces become more cautious, even more so given Nepal’s geo-political situation. Some of their concerns are valid. They fear political instability in Nepal may have an adverse impact on their genuine issues. We have to take this naturally. Second, it is no secret that we have a long legacy of facing external interference. Sometimes such interventions are carried out covertly and sometimes overtly. Therefore, national forces should be strong. Some political parties and leaders have a tendency of seeking external forces’ support to fulfil their vested interests. In return, they serve the external forces’ undue interests. Formation of a government is a purely domestic affair, but in our case sometimes it also becomes an issue of geopolitical interest. It is said that the UML was spooked when it learned that Prime Minister Dahal had reportedly approached the Congress for a new alliance. This reportedly happened after Dahal returned from New Delhi following Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s swearing-in.We were taken by surprise when the Congress leaders told us that the prime minister had reached out to them with a proposal to form a national consensus government. We were informed about the development from the leaders of the main opposition party. When we reached the March 4 deal with the prime minister, we thought he came to us with a commitment to course correction. Based on that, we supported him almost unconditionally. We didn’t bargain while sharing ministerial portfolios and didn’t talk about the prime minister’s term. We had even thought of allowing Dahal to run the government for the full term if the government functioned well and people were satisfied. We hadn’t even imagined that we would have to think about changing the coalition within four months.We definitely had certain grievances such as a lack of consultation with our party and our lawmakers while preparing the government’s policies and programmes and while allocating budget. Our party chair brought up this issue with the prime minister. But our concerns weren’t addressed. They had already started to ignore us. There were several issues with the prime minister, but we were committed to the partnership. But they had already gone too far. Fortunately, the Congress leaders didn’t accept the offer and instead raised critical questions about the rationale behind the proposal. Basically, the Congress didn’t trust Prachanda ji [Dahal] and came to us. It concluded that Dahal didn’t come with the intent of solving the country’s problems but to manoeuvre between the Congress and the UML.Besides jointly running the government, constitution amendment is another major aspect of the latest Congress-UML deal. What are the provisions the parties want to change?There are four major objectives of this agreement. Safeguarding national interest; strengthening economy; improving governance and service delivery; and ensuring political stability. A debate has started that some constitutional provisions are not helping maintain political stability. What we have said is that it’s been almost a decade since the promulgation of this constitution. Some of its provisions are yet to be implemented. On the other hand, provincial governments complain that they have not been able to work in a full-fledged way because the federal government has still not made some laws they need. So, first, we will undertake a comprehensive review on the progress in the course of implementing the constitution and the challenges we faced in the past decade, among other things. While doing so, we will find out if there are provisions that have posed challenges in maintaining political stability and running a stable government and suggest amendments accordingly.So, it’s not only about the amendment but also about review, assessment and recommendation for amendment, if there is a need. Even if the amendment process begins, it will be limited to ensuring political stability and won’t touch other aspects of the statute. There is no need to over-react. For instance, some Maoist leaders are trying to make it a political issue by describing it as a regressive move. That is wrong.So as per the two-party deal, the statute will be reviewed but not necessarily amended?Yes, whether to go for amendments will depend on the findings of the review. No constitution in the world is perfect. Its success largely depends on the practitioners. So, first we have to differentiate between the role of the constitution and the practitioners. It is true that our society is divided over certain provisions of our constitution. All these issues will be considered, but the fundamental features of the constitution such as democracy, inclusion and federalism won’t be altered. Our priority would be to only remove hindrances in making the system more functional, people-oriented and productive.Of late, people are debating the electoral system, provincial structure and secularism. Will these issues also be dealt with?Federalism is a new system for us. In fact, it is still an in-the-making process in Nepal. We have to note some timelines while analysing the performance of provinces. After the provincial and federal elections in 2017, the first provincial governments were formed in 2018, and they worked for around three years in a stable way. With small cabinets, they worked genuinely to strengthen the provincial system. At the time, most provincial cabinets had around six to seven ministers. They weren’t severely criticised at the time. The wrong trends in the provinces started with the division of the then Nepal Communist Party and the fall of the NCP-led governments at the centre as well as provinces. We saw the trend of horse-trading in provinces. Small parties made unjustified bargaining for ministerial portfolios, chief ministers started splitting ministries and increasing the number of ministers in their cabinets. Also, the November 2022 polls again gave a fragmented verdict, further augmenting the instability and anomalies at the provincial level. So, the problem is the way we are handling things more than the provincial structures. The time isn’t ripe to seek an alternative to the provinces. As far as the electoral model is concerned, we included proportional electoral (PR) system after long debates and discussions. Based on three general elections held after 1990, a conclusion was drawn that the first-past-the-post (FPTP) model couldn’t properly represent the historically under-represented sections. The premise is still valid. Based on the achievements, we may exclude certain communities from the list. But that time hasn’t come. Two questions raised over the use of PR are valid. Is the system really doing justice to the strata and class of the society for which it was introduced? This is the question not about the PR system but the leaders who use it. Similarly, some questions: Is proportional representation required in executive as well because representation is basically vital for policy making? The forms and modalities of the PR system might be discussed, but no one has even thought of removing the inclusive system.Similar is the case with secularism. The spirit is to make the state patron of all religions in the country. However, some sections of society have often tried to misuse and misinterpret the new constitutional provision. They try to interpret secularism as openly allowing rampant religious conversion, and some have made it an excuse to attack the age-old Sanatan faith. For instance, if the President or prime minister visits Lumbini, gurudwara or a shrine of any other faith on certain occasions, that is taken positively, but when they visit Pashupatinath Temple, a section of people raise questions. These activities have made some people think that these attacks on our Sanatan faith are taking place because of the secular system. There is no problem in the constitutional provision because the statute added an explanatory note that states, “‘secular’ means religious, cultural freedoms, including protection of religion and culture handed down from time immemorial.” But some extremist activities have given wrong impressions.Some experts believe the problem of fragmented mandate can be addressed by increasing the threshold required for a political party to be eligible to get PR seats, which can be done by amending laws. Will the Congress-UML alliance opt for this?Yes, this is one feasible option. I am in favour of this. As per the existing provision, a political party can secure seats under the PR category by securing 3 percent votes in the federal parliament and 1.5 percent votes in provincial assemblies. If a political organisation doesn’t even represent 5 or 7 or 10 percent of the population, what can they contribute to the country? You do politics to represent a sizable population and get a public mandate. Otherwise, the presence of such groups would only promote unreasonable bargaining and instigate instability in governments. This can be one of the agenda of the discussion between the two parties.This time, leaders have made it transparent that chiefs of the two parties will lead the government on a rotational basis. But why have other details of the agreement not been made public?There hasn’t been topic-wise discussions on specific provisions. The broader understanding is to review and assess the implementation aspect of the constitution and move ahead based on the findings of the assessment. We have also made it clear that such an act will be guided only by the objective of ensuring political stability and we will not go beyond that. Who will undertake this type of constitution review?We haven’t worked on it in detail. We haven’t reached any understanding. Naturally, inputs will be taken from the constitution makers, experts on constitutional law and politicians involved in this field. But no decision has been made on its nitty-gritty.The Rastriya Prajatantra Party that wants to revive the Hindu kingdom was the first party to welcome the Congress-UML deal while the Maoist Centre has accused Congress and UML of making a regressive move. So don’t you think this affair is tricky?I don’t think the political parties will touch the issues that the RPP talks about, such as reinstatement of Hindu kingdom and dissolution of federalism. No one is thinking about that. Also, the questions raised by the Maoist leaders have no meaning. They are only trying to make a political agenda.It also seems that the Congress and the UML floated this idea of reviewing the constitution to make a case for the two largest parties to form the government.That’s not true. This question undermines the spirit of this agreement. If this system fails, people will raise questions mainly to the leaders of the Congress and the UML, not Prachanda. It’s not only about running the government. We were already in the government and it isn’t a big deal for the Congress to return to power. If democracy fails, the democratic forces will lose the most. So we are genuinely working on this. The Congress and the UML are historical rival forces in Nepali politics. How can the two work together in government?It is true that the Congress and the UML are the two major competitors of this country. But we have some converging factors. First, we both believe in a broader democratic framework. Sometimes, the Congress may give more emphasis on liberal values while we may push for more socialism-oriented programmes. But the common ground is democratic values. We also have the experience of successfully carrying out certain tasks jointly. We may have some friction but we also have experience of managing bitter intra-party fighting as well as inter-party rivalry.How will the ministerial portfolios be shared in the new coalition?We haven’t reached any agreement in detail. As we aim to make this a ‘national consensus government’ we are in favour of accommodating other parties. So it will depend on the number of parties that join the Cabinet. Our only concern is that ministerial allocations should be done in a way that doesn’t weaken the prime minister in order to ensure that the head of the government can deliver.How can a government without the Maoist Centre and some other parties be called a consensus government?We have to wait for that. Leaders of political parties that fiercely criticise the government also join the Cabinet under one or other pretext. Some political parties seemingly cannot exist without being in the government.  \nToday, Nepal is expected to experience partly to generally cloudy conditions.

Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nBangladesh was thrown into turmoil on Monday after the army took charge following Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s resignation in the wake of violent anti-quota protests by students.The recent protests, which saw hundreds of students killed, prompted Hasina to leave the country in a hurry. She is learnt to have landed in neighbouring India’s Tripura state by an army helicopter, and is reportedly planning to move on to Europe. In a televised address to the nation following Hasina’s departure, Bangladeshi army chief General Waker-uz-Zaman announced the formation of a new interim government. The situation is a grim reminder of Sri Lanka in 2022, when protesters ousted the ruling Rajapaksha family from the country. Some social media users in Nepal suggested their homeland could face a similar situation due to mounting public frustration over the economic crisis, lack of jobs, and mass exodus of youths and students who seek opportunities abroad.The Nepali Embassy in Dhaka has issued an advisory for Nepalis staying in Bangladesh regarding their safety amid the ongoing unrest there.The Embassy released a notice on Monday requesting all Nepali nationals staying in Bangladesh to stay safe and secure in their current locations and take help from the embassy if they need repatriation.According to the embassy, currently, there are around 400 Nepalis in Bangladesh as most of the Nepalis there have already returned home earlier.Although the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not issued any statement on the unfolding situation in Bangladesh, a key partner in SAARC, BIMSTEC, and other regional and global forums, Nepal has issued “red alert” at some key border points in eastern Nepal. This precaution aims to prevent any spillover effect from Bangladesh’s unrest, including illegal border crossings and infiltration along the porous Nepal-India border.It is relatively easier for Bangladeshi nationals to enter Nepal via India through various districts in the Koshi Province.Many nationals from third countries have entered Nepal via India and sought shelter as ‘refugees’ here.Earlier, groups of Rohingyas illegally entered Nepal via the Mechi Bridge and other entry points, eventually reaching Kathmandu after the military coup in Myanmar. Similarly, following the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan, some Afghans entered Nepal as ‘refugees’ via India.A meeting of the central security committee headed by Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak was convened at the Home Ministry to discuss the latest situation in Bangladesh and the security along the Nepal-India border. After the meeting, according to home ministry officials, directives were issued to security forces in order to increase vigilance along the border. “We have issued a ‘red alert’ at the entry points mainly in eastern Nepal, and stepped up vigilance along the Nepal-India border due to the unfolding situation inside Bangladesh,” DIG Kumar Neupane, spokesperson of the Armed Police Force, told the Post.“We have increased our regular checks, boosted deployment, and tightened security at checkpoints, mostly in Koshi, Madhesh, and Lumbini provinces,” said Neupane. “We are also closely monitoring the situation across the Nepal-India border.”“From Ilam to Lumbini province, we have increased vigilance to stop any kind of illegal crossing besides that of Indian nationals,” he said. The Armed Police Force guarding the Nepal-India border has set up over 244 border outposts.Besides the Armed Police Force, the Ministry of Home Affairs has instructed other security agencies, such as the Nepal Police and National Intelligence Department, to increase vigilance and deployment along the Nepal-India border.Experts and diplomats have also expressed concerns about the unfolding situation in Bangladesh. “The government should speak up,” said Madhuraman Acharya, former foreign secretary and ambassador. “The unfolding situation in neighbouring Bangladesh is a matter of concern that the government of Nepal should keep a close watch on, and it should call for a speedy return to normalcy, peace, and order in that country in line with the wishes of the Bangladeshi people.” As chaos and unrest began in Bangladesh, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs asked Nepali students to stay safe and facilitated the return of those who wanted to return home via land and air.“The government of Nepal should formulate its position and call for the restoration of normalcy and peace in Bangladesh,” said Acharya.Some experts believe the emerging situation in Bangladesh will have ripple effects across South Asia, noting that the circumstances in Sri Lanka in 2022 and now in Bangladesh are totally different. While the events in Sri Lanka were fueled by an economic crisis, Bangladesh’s economy is one of the most robust in South Asia. But Hasina was accused of accumulating and misusing power. “The dramatic regime change in Bangladesh will reverberate through the region,” said Nischal Nath Pandey, director of Centre for South Asian Studies (CSAS). “Having a supermajority in parliament is not enough,” he noted.“Bad governance, impunity, massive corruption, self-centred leadership and cronyism can lead to youth disenchantment,” he said, adding that Nepali leadership should also learn from Bangladesh’s experience.“Good governance, corruption control, appointments based on merit, and understanding youth sentiments are key to political survival.” \nThe Meteorological Forecasting Division under the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology has issued a ‘heavy to very heavy’ rainfall warning for Tuesday and Wednesday.Issuing a ‘monsoon special bulletin’ on Monday morning, the Met Office said that the monsoon trough is positioned north of the average place in the east and south of the average place in the west, and this unusual positioning could lead to more intense rain. The monsoon trough is a low-pressure area that brings moisture-laden winds from the oceans and causes increased cloudiness and rains.“There is a chance of heavy to very heavy rainfall in some places of Koshi, Bagmati, Gandaki, Lumbini, and Sudurpaschim provinces and a few places of Karnali and Madhesh provinces,” reads the bulletin issued by the Met Office. “There is also a chance of extremely heavy rainfall in one or two places of Bagmati, Gandaki, and Lumbini provinces.”The Met Office warned of the risk of landslides, debris flow, and land erosion in the hills and risks of floods and inundation in urban areas and in the Tarai. Water levels in small and big rivers could rise, and daily life, agriculture, health, tourism, and land and air transportation could also be affected, according to the bulletin. The Met Office has asked the general public and all relevant agencies for precautions.This is the sixth special bulletin issued by the Met Office since the start of the monsoon on June 10.The monsoon season in Nepal generally begins on June 13 and ends on September 23. This year, the monsoon entered Nepal from the southwest on June 10, three days ahead of the usual onset date. Last year, it started on June 14, a day later than normal.This year, the division has forecast above-normal rains and above-average maximum and minimum temperatures this monsoon, which could unleash extreme weather events such as flooding, inundation, and landslides.Several districts have already reported incidents of landslides, flooding and lightning since the start of the monsoon season.According to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority, at least 150 people have died, and scores have been injured and missing in landslides, flood and lightning-related incidents since June 10.What do red, orange and yellow warnings signify?Red warning: According to Met officials, a red warning means looming extreme weather conditions. Excessive rainfall, floods, landslides, inundation, and others are likely to cause widespread damage. For the general public, it is a message to keep themselves and others safe from the extreme weather consequences and not to travel in risky zones. “Along with the general public, this is also an alert to all agencies concerned to gear up for response,” said Raju Pradhananga, a senior meteorologist.Red alerts have been issued for the districts of Taplejung, Panchthar, Sankhuwasabha, and Terhathum in the Koshi province; and Rasuwa, Chitwan, Nuwakot, Dhading, Sindhupalchok, and Dolakha in the Bagmati province. Likewise, Myagdi, Kaski, Baglung, Parbat, Syangja, Tanahun, Nawalparasi-East, Lamjung and Gorkha districts of the Gandaki province are also in the red zone. Similarly, red alerts have been issued for Kapilvastu, Rupandehi, Palpa, Gulmi, Nawalparasi-West, Dang, Banke, Bardia, Gulmi, Arghakhanchi of Lumbini province, as well as Kailali, Kanchanpur, Dadeldhura, Doti and Baitadi of the Sudurpaschim province.Orange warning: An orange warning also means moderate risks. Experts say severe situations due to extreme weather events are very likely in the said districts. For the general public, it is a message to make preparatory plans for potential emergencies. As the probability of extreme weather events is high, it is also a request not to travel in risky zones—landslide-prone roads and riverbanks, among others. According to Pradhananga, it is also a request to people to protect themselves and family members.The orange warning has been issued for the Okhaldhunga, Jhapa and Morang districts of the Koshi province; Siraha, Saptari and Dhanusha of Madhesh, and Ramechhap, Kathmandu and Bhaktapur of Bagmati. Orange warning has been also issued in Manang of the Gandaki province; Rukum-East and Rolpa of Lumbini, Dailekh, Surkhet, Salyan, Rukum-West, Jajarkot and Kalikot of the Karnali province; and Darchula and Achham of the Sudurpaschim province.Yellow warning: A yellow warning signifies serious consequences from extreme weather events, but its chances are very low. The bad weather conditions could disrupt daily lives. The yellow warning has been issued in Mustang, Dolpa, Mugu, Humla, Jumla, Bajura and Bajhang districts. \nIn Nepali Congress, the position of general secretary is considered the second most powerful after the party president.Historically, some charismatic leaders have held the position in the country’s grand old party: from Krishna Prasad Bhattarai in the 1950s, to Mahendra Narayan Nidhi, Girija Prasad Koirala, to now the duo of Gagan Thapa and Bishwa Prakash Sharma.When two relatively younger and popular leaders—Thapa and Sharma—got elected as general secretaries in December 2021, they had kindled hope among young Congress members and well-wishers of the party.But over time, they have failed to implement their agendas as the establishment led by party chief Deuba is dominant. Political analysts and observers, too, say that Thapa and Sharma have failed to reflect the strength of their popular mandate in the party decision making process.Prior to its 14th general convention, the party had the provision of one elected general secretary whereas the other was nominated by the party President after the general convention. In the last convention, the party amended its statute and made it mandatory to elect both the general secretaries and other party bearers through voting.With Thapa and Sharma elected as the Congress general secretaries, they were expected to challenge the septuagenarian party President Sher Bahadur Deuba.However, as a party insider claims, the general secretary duo themselves are struggling to create their space in party leadership. This struggle is a testament to the challenges they face in cementing their influence in the Congress, says a party leader.“The party’s general secretary is usually occupied with official work,” Prakash Sharan Mahat, a Congress spokesperson, told the Post. “How active they are in the party’s internal affairs is not something I can comment on.”After being elected as the party’s general secretaries, Thapa and Sharma have publicly spoken about being kept in the dark on vital matters. For instance, while speaking at the 42nd BP Memorial programme held on July 20, Thapa said the July 1 agreement between Congress and CPN-UML reached to form a new coalition government came as a surprise.Purushottam Dahal, a senior journalist close to the Congress, says the two general secretaries didn’t understand their exact role.“The general secretary’s role is to make the party’s central secretariat functional, but they are trying to be reactionary, which is inappropriate,” Dahal told the Post. “To make the party functional, they should not wait for a green signal from the party president.”However, General Secretary Sharma rubbishes such a claim.“There have been some transformative changes in the party after we assumed the role of general secretaries,” Sharma told the Post. “From establishing a library in the party’s central office to holding the BP Koirala Literature Festival, we have made the party more vibrant.”He argued that what has happened is that the duo have failed to publicise some of their important works.The general secretaries claim they are facing difficulties because of the party leadership’s working style, but some leaders don’t buy that argument.Sharma further claims that their work is often hindered by the generational gap with Deuba.“In addition, both of us general secretaries were elected from different panels during the general convention, which caused some misunderstanding among party leaders,” Sharma said.But there are other Congress leaders who accuse the general secretaries of suddenly turning risk-averse. “They are bound by the party statute as the party follows a presidential system where the president prevails over others,” Govinda Pokharel, a newly appointed head of the Economic Policy and Planning Department of the Congress, told the Post. “However, the two general secretaries cannot accommodate all groups in the party, and hence their difficulties.” According to Pokharel, after becoming the party’s office bearers, they are slowly turning cautious. “Although they have a very popular base and they also have content-based knowledge on development, they are not being able to use their potential.” Sharma differs.“We have challenged the party leadership on many issues to establish our agenda,” Sharma said. “At the party’s Mahasamiti meeting in February, we successfully proposed contesting the upcoming election with the party’s own strength… The party's central committee meeting, which will commence on Wednesday, will pass our proposal as it is.” A Congress leader close to General Secretary Thapa, however, acknowledged that Thapa is sometimes clueless about the party’s functioning.“From the beginning, the general secretaries have not been able to mobilise the leaders in their fold effectively,” Shankar Tiwari, a Congress youth leader close to Thapa, told the Post. “Sometimes they prevail over the party president, but on many other occasions they are also at his mercy.”Meanwhile, a few Congress leaders claim that the popularity of the general secretaries duo is diminishing, which could make it difficult for them to elevate themselves in party politics in the coming days. There are ample examples where Congress leaders lost their revolutionary spirit after becoming general secretary, says the leader.Only three past general secretaries of Congress have succeeded in becoming party chief and the prime minister. Krishna Prasad Bhattarai was the general secretary of the party soon after the establishment of democracy in Nepal in 1950. Likewise, Girija Prasad Koirala, another general secretary during the 1990s, later became the prime minister as well as the party President. Sushil Koirala was the third general secretary to become party president, and the prime minister. Jagat Nepal, a long-time Congress observer, says that apart from the prime minister, two of the Congress’s general secretaries have become the country’s President, if not party president and prime minister. “Ram Baran Yadav, the first President of the country, and Ramchandra Paudel, the current President, both were once the party’s general secretary,” Nepal told the Post. Besides, Taranath Ranabhat, the former general secretary of the party, and Paudel became Speakers of the House of Representatives in the 1990s.Nepal added that despite not being elevated to the party’s top position, a few former general secretaries of Congress had played an important role in national politics. “We can’t draw a sweeping conclusion that leaders lose their influence after becoming general secretary,” he said.Apart from the leaders mentioned above, Mahendra Narayan Nidhi, Krishna Prasad Sitaula, Prakash Man Singh, Sashank Koirala, and Purna Bahadur Khadka were the few among others who took up the responsibility of the general secretary.“As far as why they were not able to lift themselves to the top position is concerned, sometimes, despite their personal efficiency, circumstances might not be favourable,” Dahal, the senior journalist, said.General Secretary Sharma echoes Dahal.In the past, the party president used to nominate one of the two general secretaries. In such a case, the nominated general secretary would obviously not be able to challenge the party chief, Sharma said. From the 14th general convention, the party started to elect both general secretaries through voting by party delegates. \nNepal national women’s volleyball team defeated the Maldives in straight sets in their final group match of the CAVA Women’s Volleyball Nations League on Sunday, setting up a semi-final showdown against a strong Iran.Nepal, who were already assured of a semi-final spot, won against winless Maldives 25-8, 25-19, 25-18 at the National Sports Council’s covered hall in Tripureshwar, Kathmandu.The outcome means Nepal finished their league stage in second position with nine points from four matches, which included three wins and one loss.Aruna Shahi’s team’s only loss in the tournament so far came against Iran on Saturday, which prevented them from topping India in the group.The Indians defeated Sri Lanka 25-13, 25-21, 25-20 that gave them 10 points from four matches.The winners of the group stage face the fourth-placed team in the last four, while the second-placed team battle against the third-placed team.It means Nepal will clash against strong Iran in the semis but it will also be an opportunity for the home side to avenge the group stage loss.Shahi, whose team are still fresh from their historic first ever victory over India on Friday, said Nepal could overpower Iran in the final four but will have to make some improvements.“We need to tighten our receiving and defence. If we do that, we could beat Iran,” said Shahi during the post match conference after defeating the Maldives.“We also made many minor mistakes that cost us the game on Saturday. We will need to work on that as well.”India face Sri Lanka, who finished in the fourth position with four points.Both semi-final matches will take place on Tuesday. \nFor the past five days, every TV screen in Nepal has been displaying a message: Dear customers, due to a sudden and unforeseen problem with the channel distributor, international channels like Sony, Star, Zee, and Icast are currently unavailable.” Cable and internet TV operators have apologised for the disruption and assured that they would resolve the matter. Consumer rights activists say that consumers are being cheated under various pretexts.Nepali operators say that delays in approving the à la carte pricing guidelines by the Finance Ministry led the Indian broadcaster to cut some channels from cable and internet TV services last Thursday evening. “As the dues piled up due to the delays by the government in giving approval to the pricing guidelines, the Indian Broadcasting and Digital Foundation decided to cut channel services in Nepal,” said Sudhir Parajuli, president of the Federation of Nepal Cable Television Association.The Indian Broadcasting and Digital Foundation is a unified representative body of TV broadcasters and over-the-top platforms in India. Over-the-top platforms are streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, among others, that deliver content over the internet directly to viewers.Before the à la carte system, broadcasters and distributors would reach an agreement and sign a contract that included pricing details, said Parajuli. “With the implementation of the à la carte system, new pricing guidelines were required.”In August last year, the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology formally implemented the “pick-and-pay” option for Nepali television viewers.“Since the Indian broadcasters were initially not ready to adopt the à la carte system, we were also in a dilemma. Eventually, the government strictly enforced the system.”The Ministry of Communications then prepared and sent the tariff guidelines to the Ministry of Finance. “It took a while for the Ministry of Finance to give its approval,” said Parajuli.The Ministry of Finance finally gave its approval to the guidelines last Thursday and sent them to the Ministry of Communications, said Parajuli.“The distributors have not been able to pay the Indian broadcasters for the last 14 months. The outstanding dues amount to Rs500 million,” Parajuli said. The Ministry of Communications could not issue foreign exchange recommendations for distributors to pay their Indian vendors because the guidelines had been stalled.“Now that the guidelines have been approved, services will resume within a few days,” Parajuli said.Government officials claimed they were unaware of the issue.The secretary at the Ministry of Communications, Radhika Aryal, said she was unaware of the issue because she had been newly appointed to the ministry.The Post's multiple attempts to reach the ministry spokesperson Gajendra Thakur were unsuccessful.Officials from the Department of Information and Broadcasting, also said they were unaware of the issue.The à la carte system allows viewers to choose and pay only for the channels they want to watch. This allows viewers to watch their favourite channels and pay only for those, rather than the whole package that includes channels they rarely watch. The Ministry of Communications has fixed a minimum monthly fee of Rs250 per customer for cable television to cover carrying costs.This model is used in countries like India, the United States, and Canada.According to the federation, there are eight cable TV operators, including internet TV providers in Nepal. Around 110 Nepali channels and 98 foreign channels are broadcast in Nepal, serving around 1.5 million subscribers who have renewed their subscriptions. Service providers pay monthly fees to both the distributor and to the Indian broadcasters. “We have been paying the distributor every month, but the distributor has not received foreign exchange approvals from the Ministry of Communications,” said Parajuli.According to the federation, the Indian broadcaster has suspended all packages from Zee, Sony, Colours, and Star across the country. If some customers still have access to these channels, then it must be pirated.Currently, TV channels in Nepal are broadcast through direct-to-home, multiple-system operators, multichannel multipoint distribution services, internet protocol television, and digital terrestrial television, among other methods.“Customers pay in advance for cable TV services, but the service has been interrupted for five days, and there is no sign of resumption. This is a total scam,” said Prem Lal Maharjan, president of the National Consumers Forum.“Who is responsible for this, and who will compensate for this?” He demanded that the service providers compensate the customers for the disruption. \nBangladesh’s army chief will meet student protest leaders on Tuesday as the country awaits the formation of a new government a day after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled following a violent uprising against her that killed hundreds.Student leaders, who spearheaded a movement against job quotas that turned into a call for Hasina to resign, said early on Tuesday that they want a new interim government with Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus as its chief adviser.“Any government other than the one we recommended would not be accepted,” Nahid Islam, one of the key organisers of the student movement, said in a video on Facebook with three other organisers. “We wouldn’t accept any army-supported or army-led government.”“We have also had discussions with Muhammad Yunus and he has agreed to take on this responsibility at our invitation,” Islam added.Yunus, 84, and his Grameen Bank won the 2006 Nobel Peace prize for work to lift millions out of poverty by granting tiny loans of under $100 to the rural poor of Bangladesh but he was indicted by a court in June on charges of embezzlement that he denied.Yunus did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Bangladesh Army Chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman plans to meet the protest organisers at 12 noon local time (0600 GMT) on Tuesday, the army said in a statement, a day after Zaman announced Hasina’s resignation in a televised address and said an interim government would be formed.Zaman said he had held talks with leaders of major political parties - excluding Hasina’s long-ruling Awami League - to discuss the way ahead and was due to hold talks with the president Mohammed Shahabuddin .An interim government will hold elections as soon as possible after consulting all parties and stakeholders, President Shahabuddin said in a televised address late on Monday.He also said that it was “unanimously decided” to immediately release the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) chairperson and Hasina’s nemesis, Begum Khaleda Zia, who was convicted in a graft case in 2018 but moved to a hospital a year later as her health deteriorated. She has denied the charges against her.A BNP spokesperson said on Monday that Zia, 78, was in hospital and “will clear all charges legally and come out soon”.Hasina, 76, had ruled since winning a decades-long power struggle with Zia in 2009. She landed at a military airfield, Hindon, near Delhi on Monday after leaving Dhaka, two Indian government officials told Reuters, adding that India’s National Security Adviser Ajit Doval met her there.They did not elaborate on her stay or plans. The Indian Express newspaper reported that Hasina was taken to a “safe house” and she was likely to travel to the United Kingdom. Reuters could not immediately verify the report. \nThe ripples of Nepal’s political instability are far-reaching, extending beyond its border. Soon after a government falls and a new prime minister assumes office, provincial leaders are toppled, senior bureaucrats are transferred, and ministers are changed—and so are the ambassadors. Little do our leaders seem to care how detrimental the coming and going of envoys is for the country’s image. The new coalition government headed by KP Oli has recently finalised the names of 19 envoys to serve in different capitals. The ambassadors appointed by the previous coalition under Pushpa Kamal Dahal were recalled. Only time will tell the fate of the new appointees, as we cannot say how long the incumbent government will last. Recalling envoys en masse every time there is a government change is not conducive for a country like Nepal that is having to maintain an increasingly difficult balance between major powers like India, China and the US. Ambassadors, when appointed to a new place, need some time to familiarise themselves with their new environment. But if they are replaced no sooner than they are appointed, the very purpose of diplomacy is lost. Half of Nepal’s ambassadors are political appointees and the rest are career diplomats. The political appointments in particular are problematic. Krishna Prasad Oli, a close associate of the prime minister, has been picked as the ambassador to China. (His main coalition partner, Sher Bahadur Deuba, the Nepali Congress chief, also undoubtedly got to have his say in other picks.) Oli’s envoys are predominantly so-called upper-caste men, with only four women and not a single Dalit ambassador nominee. There also seems to be little forethought on when and when not to recall ambassadors. Take the case of Shankar Sharma, Nepal’s former ambassador to India. Appointed by Deuba in March 2022 when he was in a coalition with Dahal, Sharma was recalled when Dahal allied with Oli to form a new government back in March this year. He has been reappointed after coming to power of the UML-Congress coalition. This kind of immature diplomacy with a country as important as India will do great harm to Nepal’s interests. Experts have suggested increasing the proportion of career diplomats as ambassadors from the current 50 percent to 80 or 90 percent. That will apparently decrease political meddling in the process. Perhaps an even better idea is to pick ambassadors, at least to important capitals like New Delhi, Beijing and Washington DC, on the basis of broad political understanding. After all, even if there is a change in government, a combination of the same two or three parties will come to power. If that is the case, why not make these picks judiciously through political consultations and let the ambassadors work for their full four-year term? That would also be in keeping with our national interest. One thing that can be done to ensure that the right people are picked is to make the nominees undergo a rigorous parliamentary vetting process. Up until now, such hearings for ambassador picks have been no more than rituals. But as we recently saw in the case of Krishna Man Pradhan, someone charged with sexual exploitation who was nominated as election commissioner, the parliamentary hearing process can be quite effective in keeping out the bad eggs. Again, in these testing times around the world for international relations and diplomacy, Nepal cannot afford to continue with its current ad hoc approach. \nThe Gurung villagers, including some women, assaulted a Dalit man and his mother at their home in the Gurkha village of Lwang, Machhapuchhre Rural Municipality, Kaski, on Friday night. They also broke windows and shouted casteist slurs as well as demeaning remarks. The Dalit victims survived the unprovoked attack, but the single mother required treatment in intensive care at a hospital in Pokhara. Someone bravely took a video of the brutality on their mobile and uploaded it to a YouTube channel. That’s how the terrible crime came to public notice. I learnt from both the video reporting and community members that the local police have refused to register the case as an attempted murder motivated by caste hatred. The local authorities have bent on protecting the accused, their caste fellows, from legal action. This case shows how Dalits continue to suffer mental and physical violence at the hands of ethnic or tribal groups as well. Upper castes are generally blamed for committing crimes against Dalits, but it is not exclusive to them. I suggest that the incident can also be a window into the rather perplexing question of why ethnic groups like the Gurung, Magar, Rai and Limbu continue to segregate and dominate Dalits, even though their movements have vociferously denounced caste hierarchy and distanced themselves from Hindu customs and cultures for decades.Criminals of historyIn a recent Kathmandu gathering hosted by the newly established “Front for Identity” (opened two months ago under the leadership of Mahendra Lawoti, professor of political science at Western Michigan University, USA), Gopal Kirati, veteran leader of ethnic communities and former minister from the Maoist party, made an interesting self-reflexive remark. He said, “I’m a criminal of history. Growing up, I learnt nothing from this society and culture except how to treat Dalits worse than animals.” I wish more ethnic leaders and activists came forward like Kirati and acknowledged their and their communities’ ill-treatment of those considered lower or less pure than themselves. The fact that they continue to humiliate and attack Dalits even now should deeply concern them. It’s also time they realised their grave mistake of excluding Dalits from their movements, which peaked in the late 1990s and included them in their fight against Brahmanism. Dalits themselves recognise many differences between their issues and those of ethnic minorities; however, in reality, there are many overlaps. For one thing, in the eyes of the so-called high-caste Hindu, even ethnic minorities are low-caste Shudra; they, too, are denied the sacred thread and treated as untouchable. Upper castes, mainly orthodox Hindus, don’t accept rice prepared by members of ethnic communities. High castes wouldn’t normally marry ethnic minorities, and even if they did, the latter would face certain restrictions, mainly in the religious and spiritual sphere. An ethnic woman married to an upper caste may be barred from worshipping the lineage deities, for example.Not to mention, thanks to the extensive Hinduisation of ethnic groups over the years, there’s a degree of caste hierarchy practised within and amongst those communities as well. The Gurung wouldn’t marry a Tamang, for example, as the latter has been placed only slightly above the Dalit on the scale of ritual pollution. If the ethnic activists had brought Dalits on board—or at least forged a strong alliance with them—their movements would have become larger and stronger. In the meantime, their populace would probably have been educated about the fallacy and inhumanity associated with the Dalit exclusion. Members of ethnic communities would have learnt that the rejection of caste hierarchy also implies the termination of ritual hierarchy altogether. Thus, the behaviour of these ethnic groups towards Dalits would have hopefully changed quite drastically by now. Ethnic leaders and activists not only excluded Dalits from their movements but also didn’t talk about ending untouchability. They were keen on toppling the Bahun hegemony and separating and suppressing the Dalits. This has been a big failure of ethnic and indigenous identity politics so far. Proponents of ethnic identity should now see this drawback, as Gopal Kiranti seems to have done, and try to bring Dalits along with them. The Front for Identity, led by Prof Lawoti, appears keen to move in this direction. Identity: Horizontal versus vertical In a highly caste-ridden society like ours, the issues of collective identity and individual freedom seem conflicting. Ethnic politics does reify and solidify group boundaries. Ethnic groups are eager to highlight and bolster those inter-group boundaries, whereas Dalits want to dissolve those boundaries once and for all. How do we conceptually overcome this apparent mismatch?Notably, ethnic groups are horizontally arranged—long-term Hinduisation and caste-ification notwithstanding. They are culturally separate but, by and large, equal in status hierarchy. There’s much equality in how these groups interact with each other. Ethnic activists are keen to preserve and promote this horizontal separation.This doesn’t necessarily hurt Dalits’ quest for equality because they want to dismantle the vertical hierarchy and arrange themselves horizontally. They don’t want the statuses to be conceived as big and small, high and low, top and bottom, pure and impure. This explains why many Dalits hate the caste system while loving their caste identities. Dalit caste associations aren’t as big and influential as ethnic associations, yet they have been an important part of the Dalit movement for decades.Once people understand the difference between these two sets of identities arranged horizontally and vertically, the ethnic and Dalit movements can coalesce. This way, ethnic and Dalit campaigners can find common ground and struggle together. This should be the new way forward to accelerate societal change. The recent case of caste violence sheds light on the fact that caste discrimination is rampant within ethnic minority communities, too. They may resent the Hindu social hierarchy in terms of Bahun supremacy, but they are eager to continue suppressing Dalits. My past research and experience show that ethnic communities have played a big role in dominating Dalits, sometimes worse than upper castes! Things should change now, and activists from the new generation must be the active agents of that important change. If you really want to shake the social structure, don’t just fix the ones above you. Consider the plight of those below you. It’s basically the same principle and practice. If you want to challenge Brahmanic supremacy, get rid of your own supremacy as well. Charity begins at home, and so does change!  \nPakistan’s human rights battles are now playing out across its digital landscape. The X ban drags on, fantasies of data localisation persist, and talk of further social media regulation is circulating. The state says it is indigenising internet infrastructure and better securing the nation. Digital and human rights activists are bracing for more censorship and targeted surveillance. In all scenarios, there is a risk that digital developments exacerbate gender inequality.This is the key warning of a new report from Amnesty International on Gender and Human Rights in a Digital Age. The wider deployment of technology—whether for good or evil—brings with it risks of what Amnesty refers to as tech-facilitated gender-based violence. Both Pakistan’s authoritarians and activists should ensure that digital deployments do not exacerbate gender discrimination in our country.Talk of tech is by default optimistic, and marginalised groups have overall benefited from digital technology, whether through finding online communities of like-minded souls or accessing information and services previously denied to them. The greatest threat to this digital empowerment remains access: Pakistan’s digital gender gap is severe, with 26 percent of women accessing the internet as compared to 47pc of men.While internet infrastructure is often posited as the solution to access gaps, the Amnesty report emphasises that the persistence of patriarchal structures in the digital realm means that discrimination endures even where infrastructure becomes available. One reason for this is the datafication of our lives. To exist in the 21st century, you need a data profile. And this profile is born from digital identity cards, online credit histories, e-bills to physical addresses, and yes, unfettered internet access. These are all things routinely denied to marginalised groups, particularly women, in the offline world. Any new digital regulation that prioritises security considerations over inclusion would be doing a disservice to the Pakistani people.Data collection is also inherently discriminatory. The approach is often rooted in existing structural inequality, rendering marginalised groups invisible online as well. The Amnesty report points to digital identity systems as a key example of this. Think of our own national identity cards that require identification in the context of patriarchal family structures. Nadra is specifically called out in the report for deciding in 2023 to temporarily suspend the option for individuals to identify as ‘X’ in the gender category, leaving many transgender people without digital identification and so without access to other social services.Of course, with more inclusive data profiles comes a greater need for data protection and privacy. For marginalised groups, datafication also means enhanced vulnerability. Such groups may go online to access information or services that are sensitive or stigmatised (for example, information about reproductive health). The ability to freely access and share information and services without fear of surveillance should be respected as a core human right.There is also a gendered aspect to the economic opportunities that digitisation offers. The Pakistani debate on technology has become entirely securitised. But digital access is also about finding jobs in the gig economy, availing the benefits of digital entrepreneurship and ensuring that contract workers are fairly compensated by non-transparent algorithms. In all these arenas, women are at higher risk of reduced access to opportunity, discriminatory wages and oppressive workplace surveillance. Indeed, Amnesty argu­­es that tech-fa­c­­­­ilitated gender discrimination is likely to worsen gende­red poverty worldwide.Once online, women are also more vulnerable to online harassment. In a 2022 HRCP report Rethinking the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, Farieha Aziz highlights how Peca has failed to protect women. Not only has the law failed to deter against online harassment, but it has also, she argues, exacerbated patriarchal oppression through its implementation. She documents how women who have sought justice under Peca have, instead, been subjected to additional offline harassment and intimidation by FIA officials, humiliation by lawyers, and retaliatory defamation charges. Such gender-based harassment should be the real security concern.Sadly, women will also increasingly bear the brunt of state efforts to control the digital realm. This will be due to a vicious cycle in which women will turn to feminist activism or political protest to defend their rights, and then find those rights further trampled through digital surveillance and censorship. Pakistani women have it hard enough; digital technology should not set them back further.-Dawn (Pakistan)/ANN \nGeneral elections give the political parties the only real chance to test their popularity. What we have seen in the recent past is a clear preference of Nepal’s major forces for pre-poll alliances. With the country’s mixed electoral system unlikely to give any single party an absolute majority and thus a shot at forming the government on its own, what is the harm in jointly contesting elections with other parties? That, at least, is the argument of the proponents of such pre-election tie-ups. But in reality such pre-poll alliances smack of an utter lack of confidence and conviction. Nepali parties detest being in the opposition’s bench; there is no political culture of smaller parties accepting their limited mandate and waiting for the next five years for another shot at governing. So it makes sense for them to try to ensure, even before people head to the polls, to maximise their chances of being on the right side of the parliament’s aisle. What is more, such pre-poll alliances often come with the added bonus of safe seats for top leaders. But with parties professing vastly different ideologies standing on the same platform, the only message people get is that the country’s top parties are interested less in good governance and delivery than getting to power for its own sake. But lo and behold! All three of the country’s major parties—the Nepali Congress, the CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre)—have now publicly committed to single-handedly contest the 2027 general elections. That, we are afraid, is an unlikely prospect. The Maoist Centre, the latest of the Big Three to make such a declaration, could be wiped out at the next polls without other parties’ help. Pushpa Kamal Dahal, someone who has been at the party’s helm for 35 years—and by extension his Maoist Centre party—has lost all credibility with his pendulum-like political swings. The party, which once championed the causes of the marginalised and the downtrodden, is these days an ardent backer of the kind of crony capitalism it used to accuse the Congress and the UML of fostering. In the past elections, the Maoist Centre has allied with both the parties, to limited success. The benefits of such pre-poll alliances for the two biggest parties is questionable, too. It thus makes sense for these parties, including the Maoist Centre, to test their individual strength in upcoming elections. Despite the short-term risks, that would be the right thing to do, for the individual interests of these parties and for the larger good of Nepali democracy. People today are confused as they have no clear options at elections, and many of them choose not to vote. If instead the ballot papers reflect a clear choice between competing ideologies and agendas, it’s a whole new ballgame. The electorate can then make informed choices. For the political parties, the general elections offer a rare chance to test the strength of their programmes and leaders. Why lose this golden opportunity to do so and adapt accordingly for long-term success? Once individual parties know their real electoral strength, they can always join hands with other parties to form federal and provincial governments. Their public positions notwithstanding, do our political parties and their leaders have the self-belief to take the poll-plunge alone? People doubt it. But they will be happy to be proven wrong.   \nFormer Constituent Assembly member and senior industrialist Shrawan Kumar Agrawal passed away on Monday. He was 77.Agrawal, the former chair of the Marwadi Sewa Samiti, breathed his last at his residence in Sanepa.He was the father of Rajesh Kumar Agrawal, the president of the Confederation of Nepalese Industries (CNI).The CNI issued a condolence statement today, paying tribute to him.The late Agrawal had been leading various industries for the past 58 years. He is survived by his wife, two sons, and one daughter. He will be cremated at Pashupati Aryaghat today, according to the statement. \nAt least five US personnel were injured in an attack against a military base in Iraq on Monday, US officials told Reuters, as the Middle East braced for a possible new wave of attacks by Iran and its allies following last week’s killing of senior members of militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah.Two Katyusha rockets were fired at al Asad airbase in western Iraq, two Iraqi security sources said. One Iraqi security source said the rockets fell inside the base. It was unclear whether the attack was linked to threats by Iran to retaliate over the killing of the Hamas leader.The US officials, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said one of the wounded Americans was seriously injured. The casualty count was based on initial reports which could still change, they said.“Base personnel are conducting a post-attack damage assessment,” one of the officials added.Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, was assassinated in the Iranian capital Tehran last week, an attack that drew threats of revenge by Iran on Israel. Iran blamed Israel for the killing, but Israel has not claimed responsibility.Coupled with the killing of the senior military commander of the Lebanese group Hezbollah, Fuad Shukr, by Israel in a strike on Beirut last week, the killings have fuelled concern the conflict in Gaza was turning into a wider Middle East war.Iran has said the US bears responsibility in the assassination of Haniyeh because of its support for Israel.In a call on Monday, US. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant agreed that the attack marked “a dangerous escalation,” according to a Pentagon readout.Last week the US. carried out a strike in Iraq against individuals US. officials said were militants getting ready to launch drones and posed a threat to US. and coalition forces.The US. has been watching to see if Iran would make good on its vow to respond to the killing of Haniyeh two days ago in Tehran, one in a series of killings of senior figures in the Palestinian militant group as the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza rages.The Pentagon has said it will deploy additional fighter jets and Navy warships to the Middle East, as Washington seeks to bolster defenses following threats from Iran and its allies Hamas and Hezbollah.A rare ally of both the US. and Iran, Iraq hosts 2,500 US. troops and has Iran-backed militias linked to its security forces. It has witnessed escalating tit-for-tat attacks since the Israel-Hamas war erupted in October.Iraq wants troops from the US.-led military coalition to begin withdrawing in September and to formally end the coalition’s work by September 2025, Iraqi sources have said, with some US. forces likely to remain in a newly negotiated advisory capacity.Baghdad has struggled to reign in Iran-backed armed groups that have attacked US. forces there and in neighboring Syria dozens of time since Oct. 7.Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani spoke with US. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken on Sunday.An Iraqi official said Blinken asked Sudani to help decrease regional tensions by helping to convince Iran to temper its response to what it says was an Israeli strike in Tehran that killed the leader of Hamas last week. US. Army General Michael “Erik” Kurilla, head of US. Central Command, is currently in the Middle East. One of the US. officials said Kurilla was speaking with allies to ensure there was coordination in case of an Iranian attack against Israel. \nOn Tuesday, the weather will be generally cloudy across the country, with light to moderate rain accompanied by thunder and lightning expected in many areas of all provinces. The Meteorological Forecasting Division said there is a possibility of heavy rainfall at one or two locations in the Koshi, Madhesh, Bagmati, Gandaki, Lumbini, and Sudurpaschim provinces.Additionally, heavy to very heavy rainfall may occur at one or two spots in Koshi, Bagmati, Gandaki, and Lumbini provinces.Tonight, cloudy conditions will persist nationwide, with light to moderate rain and thunderstorms anticipated in many areas across all provinces. Heavy to very heavy rainfall may affect a few locations in the remaining provinces, while very heavy to extremely heavy rainfall is possible at one or two sites in Bagmati, Gandaki, and Lumbini provinces.Meteorological analysis indicates that monsoon winds are affecting the country, with the monsoon trough positioned to the north of the average location.On Tuesday, the highest temperature recorded was 38.4 degrees Celsius in Janakpur, while the lowest temperature was 15 degrees Celsius in Jomsom.In terms of rainfall, Ghorahi received the highest amount at 53.6 mm, followed by Dadeldhura with 30.1 mm. Other notable rainfall figures include Pokhara with 10.3 mm and Jiri with 8.6 mm. Some areas, such as Dipayal, Birendranagar, and Simara, reported no rainfall during this period. \nUnited States has been urging other countries through diplomatic channels to tell Iran that escalation in the Middle East is not in their interest, a State Department spokesperson said on Monday, at what Secretary of State Antony Blinken called a “critical moment” for the region.Blinken said Washington was “engaged in intense diplomacy, pretty much around the clock” to help calm tensions amid fears Iran is preparing a retaliatory strike against Israel.“All parties must refrain from escalation,” Blinken said during a signing ceremony with his Australian counterpart in Washington.“All parties must take steps to ease tensions. Escalation is not in anyone’s interests. It will only lead to more conflict, more violence, more insecurity.”Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in the Iranian capital Tehran last week, an attack that drew threats of revenge on Israel and fueled further concern that the conflict in Gaza was turning into a wider Middle East war.Iran has blamed Israel and said it will “punish” it; Israeli officials have not claimed responsibility for the killing. Iran backs Hamas, which is at war with Israel in Gaza, and also the Lebanese group Hezbollah, whose senior military commander Fuad Shukr was killed in an Israeli strike on Beirut last week.US President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were briefed by their national security team on the situation in the Middle East, including threats posed by Iran and its proxies to Israel and US servicemembers, the White House said. They were also briefed about an attack on Iraq’s al Asad airbase on Monday and discussed the US response.During that briefing, Biden and Harris were told by their national security team that it is still unclear when Iran and Hezbollah are likely to launch an attack against Israel “and the specifics of such an attack,” according to a US official.At least five US personnel were wounded in the rocket strike, US officials told Reuters. It was unclear whether the attack was linked to threats by Iran to retaliate over Haniyeh’s killing, in which the US said it had no involvement.Biden and Harris were also updated on US efforts to support Israel militarily if it is attacked and diplomatic efforts to “de-escalate regional tension” and reach a ceasefire and hostage-release deal in Gaza.Blinken earlier on Monday spoke with Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani and Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty.“One of the points of the engagements that we have had is to urge countries to pass messages to Iran and urge countries to make clear to Iran that it is very much not in their interests to escalate this conflict, that it is very much not in their interest to launch another attack on Israel,” said State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller.Miller, speaking at a press briefing, did not say definitively whether or not Washington’s messages have been disseminated to Iran or through which channel.“I would expect that some of them would pass that message along and impress that point upon the government of Iran,” he added.Blinken in his remarks also called for parties to “break this cycle” of violence and agree a ceasefire in the Gaza conflict, despite the killing of Haniyeh, who was a key figure in the negotiations between Israel and Hamas.“What it comes down to really is all parties finding ways to come to an agreement, not look for reasons to delay or to say no,” Blinken said. “It is urgent that all parties make the right choices in the hours and days ahead.” \nDue to civil unrest in Bangladesh, Nepal has increased security at its India-Nepal border to prevent illegal entry from third countries, including refugees fleeing the country.\nSheikh Hasina, Bangladesh's Prime Minister, fled Dhaka amid widespread protests, seeking safe passage in India, while an interim government is being formed.\nBreakthroughs have been achieved on four tunnels of the Kathmandu-Tarai Expressway, including beidended twin-tube tunnels at Dhedre and Lendanda.\nNepali Embassy issues safety advisory for Nepalis in Bangladesh amidst unrest, advising caution and offering repatriation assistance.\nIn Nepal's 2,000-year-old Kumari tradition, young girls are worshipped as goddesses, with Matina Shakya serving as the Kumari of Kathmandu from 2008-2017 before being succeeded by Trishna Shakya, with the tradition evolving to provide better education and support for Kumaris.\nMost economists believe spending on infrastructure has a significant multiplier effect. During the construction phase, infrastructure generates real cash flow for workers and their families. In the long run, it has a direct and indirect impact on the economy, with a multiplier effect, particularly in job creation.In Rupandehi, which hosts the industrial city Bhairahawa, and Lumbini, a landmark of the Buddhist world listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1997, infrastructure built with a sizeable investment has gone to waste.Big infrastructure projects like the international convention centre, meditation centre, industrial zones, and Gautam Buddha International Airport have failed to generate income and have turned into veritable white elephants.Nature has started reclaiming most of the under-utilised infrastructure.Since 2010, talk of building an international airport led to the construction of large-scale infrastructure, including a bevy of luxury hotels.Proliferating factories and a rapidly spreading transport network turned the Butwal-Bhairahawa metroplex into an economic powerhouse.Nepal opened its second international airport in May 2022 in the southern city of Bhairahawa, but no international flight stops there right now.The objective of building an international airport in Bhairahawa was to bring in more tourists, energise businesses and create jobs. But the situation is just the opposite. Traders are closing down their shops and moving abroad for decent jobs.The private sector, too, invested heavily. When the finished project started to sit idle, it hit the sector, and many enterprises were teetering into bankruptcy.Economists term this development in Lumbini a cascading failure—a breakdown in a system of interconnected parts in which the failure of one or few parts leads to the failure of other parts. Hem Raj Regmi, deputy chief statistician and data curator at the National Statistics Office, said Lumbini province saw heavy investment from the government and the private sector, but the output has slowed. “Enterprises are unable to raise even the operating cost.”In the last fiscal year, Lumbini province was estimated to grow at 4.05 percent to a GDP of Rs814 billion, from the low base of the 1.99 percent growth it had achieved in the previous fiscal year. Lumbini is estimated to contribute 14.26 percent to the national GDP. The highest value-added growth rate in Lumbini was in electricity and gas, which grew by 28.93 percent, while the manufacturing sector was estimated to shrink by a negative 1.43 percent in the last fiscal year.Most completed infrastructures in Lumbini have become white elephants, as their expenditures have been growing instead of them generating income. The Butwal International Convention Center, built with an investment of Rs1.11 billion in ward 10 of Butwal Sub Metropolis, is currently without business. The centre has 13 halls, each with a capacity to accommodate 2,700 people. The auditorium is the largest of the 13.The government built the convention centre to organise national and international conferences and events, but it is not generating much income. Construction started in 2014 and the centre was inaugurated in August 2022.Officials say that the centre is struggling to pay its staff. While the centre is under-utilised and lacks maintenance, bushes have grown around it.Dharmendra Panthi, chief of the Butwal International Convention Center project, said 22 events or functions have been conducted in the past three years, earning Rs4 million. The centre is currently closed as the provincial cabinet is yet to pass the operating guidelines even in three years.However, Panthi said they have been occasionally renting the hall on request. The centre charges Rs96,000 for a day-long event.Prabin Pathak, president of the Nepal Hoteliers Association, who took part in a recent function at the convention centre, said the infrastructure is in a sorry state due to lack of periodic maintenance.“If the building is not utilised properly, it will be a waste of tax money,” said Pathak. “The washroom faucets are dry, and it is difficult to sit in the hall due to the stench from the washroom.”“In Nepal, there is a growing trend of building new infrastructure, but their upkeep is often ignored. This is sad,” Pathak said. “No one is accountable for the losses the projects incur. Similarly, questions are raised about the quality of construction. In most projects, low-quality materials are used, severely compromising the structural integrity.”A hall with a capacity to accommodate 5,000 people built near the Buddha’s birthplace, Lumbini, has yet to do any business, except hosting a few functions. It was built with an investment of Rs720 million.Sanuraja Shakya, member-secretary of the Lumbini Development Trust, said that if a social organisation wants to conduct a function at the centre, they have to pay a fee.Shakya said that since it is a meditation centre, they do not allow other functions, especially those involving entertainment.Questions were raised about the construction when the roof started leaking soon after project’s completion. It was repaired later.Likewise, the Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in Bhairahawa, has not been fully operational for a long time. As factories have not been set up in the SEZ, the area has turned into a jungle. Construction of the SEZ had started in 2003 and it was inaugurated in 2014.Located in south-central Nepal, the Bhairahawa Special Economic Zone has 69 industrial plots of sizes from 1,400 to 3,700 square metres. A few industrialists have booked plots, but have not set up their plants as the government has failed to provide pledged services and amenities. The government had promised to provide 24-hour electricity, a one-stop service system, customs, banks, and insurance among other things inside the SEZ.“Every year, new entrepreneurs book plots, but do not set up their factories due to associated tough conditions,” said Saput Dumre, assistant director of SEZ. Dumre said industrialists are concerned about the mandatory export provision. According to SEZ guidelines, which were amended three months ago, firms that lease space inside the SEZ must export at least 30 percent of manufactured goods. “There is a water tank in the SEZ, but it has no water, the weighing machine does not work, the petrol pump is defunct, there are no parking areas, and the road is covered in thick bushes,” said Ujjwal Prasad Kasaju, a central member of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry. Then there is the new Gautam Buddha International Airport—all dressed up, and nowhere to go. The airport awaits applications for flight slots from international airlines after more than two years of opening.Nepal's second international airport was ready after ten years and nearly Rs40 billion pumped into the project, but despite the build-up, the expected rush of eager carriers is nowhere to be seen.The airport is a landmark located in south central Nepal and spread over 787 bighas (533 hectares).The modern facility has a 15,169-square-metre terminal building that can serve nearly a million passengers a year. The airport's 3,000-metre runway is long enough to handle the largest commercial jets. However, no commercial jet wants to fly to the airport. \nIn Kathmandu, where construction dust often clouds the air, the resumption of the pavement widening project at New Road on July 17 has elicited mixed reactions. While some citizens harbour doubts and disagreements, people with disabilities have their fingers crossed as well. For Narayani Dawadi, who is visually impaired, the initiative offers hope and apprehension in equal measures. She worries that the Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) might overlook the parameters for disabled-friendly infrastructure and execute the project superficially.Dawadi’s scepticism is not unwarranted. Her distrust stems from her 20 years of experience navigating Kathmandu, where she has become familiar with its footpaths and pavements. Despite this familiarity, she cannot navigate confidently due to the ever-changing, unpredictable condition of the pavements.“I don’t know if I can call the footpaths accessible,” Dawadi says. “There is tactile paving for white cane users but it’s not perfect. Sometimes they guide us to a pole or a tree, and in many places, there are only partial tactile guides, leaving us confused.”Her experience highlights a recurring issue: lack of a reliable, consistent infrastructure for people with disabilities in Kathmandu.The roads and footpaths that appear fine during the day are often damaged or under-construction by the evening, giving people with disabilities a hard time navigating them.Dawadi isn’t entirely critical; she appreciates the KMC’s sidewalk widening projects and regulations on street vending and parking. Areas like Baneshwar have become much easier to navigate, Dawadi says.However, Dawadi hopes the KMC doesn’t just displace street vendors without providing alternatives. “They need options that won’t affect their income; a crackdown won’t work.”Dawadi emphasises that KMC shouldn’t view current projects as a complete solution to make public infrastructure ‘disabled-friendly.’ Issues like half-finished tactile paving, narrow roads, and misplaced poles and tiles need to be addressed. “People with disabilities should be involved in planning,” she says.Rishi Dhakal, 44, a wheelchair user for the past 21 years and president of the Spinal Cord Injury Network Nepal, says that while the KMC has been building new footpaths and pavements with nice bricks and tiles, they often fail to meet the measurements for wheelchair use.Rishi notes that the footpath in Narayantar, between Bagmati Bridge to Jorpati Chowk, has become easier for pedestrians and the visually impaired due to reduced parking and fewer street vendors. But it remains inaccessible for wheelchair users due to a lack of proper slopes.“On many footpaths, especially at crossroads, the slope is not favourable for wheelchairs to climb,” he explains. “The footpath has become just a showpiece.”Rishi and his organisation are working to arrange a meeting with the minister and secretary of the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport to present a memorandum advocating for wheelchair-friendly slopes on Kathmandu’s footpaths. On July 21, Rishi met with the ministry’s Joint Secretary Sushil Babu Dhakal to discuss the next steps.While Rishi appreciates the ongoing work to widen pavements on New Road, he doubts the standard measurements for slopes and inclined planes for wheelchair users will be adhered to, citing KMC’s recent work on footpaths near Tribhuvan International Airport where the slopes are inaccessible.Another wheelchair user, Muskan Adhikari, pointed to a double problem of inaccessibility: footpaths lack slopes, and the sky bridges are not wheelchair-friendly. Moreover, she has faced incidents where vehicles did not stop at crossings when traffic police were absent, leading to several close calls.Rishi’s organisation has also received reports of incidents of wheelchair users being hit by vehicles in the Jorpati area.“The constitution promises accessible infrastructure for people with disabilities to navigate independently, but the current footpaths and infrastructure makes independent travel very difficult,” Adhikari said. “Forget pavements, even government offices are not accessible.”Rishi says that even the Health Ministry is only accessible up to the first floor, “forcing us to wait all day for meetings as ministers do not sit on the first floor.” This lack of accessibility extends to the KMC office itself, which has a metal ramp that is extremely difficult for wheelchair users to use and there is no tactile paving either.Vishwo Shrestha, director at the Blind Youth Association Nepal, reveals that their organisation frequently receives reports of blind and visually impaired individuals falling into sewers and rivers due to inadequate safety measures. In Sukedhara, where several offices catering to the blind community are located, a lack of proper fences along Dhobikhola river had previously resulted in accidents. The association had petitioned the KMC a year and a half ago for guard rails or road safety barriers.“Despite the installation of guard rails, there have been recent cases of individuals falling into the river due to gaps in the barriers,” Shrestha says. Shrestha adds that while not all incidents are reported, they receive two to three cases every two months involving falls into rivers or sewers. Many incidents involving collisions with poles or trees due to poor tactile guidance or uneven footpaths go unreported. “This reflects a major failure of the state’s duty,” he said.Meanwhile, for 36-year-old Radha Kumal, a blind white cane user, problems in footpaths and pavements are just part of the larger problems in the country’s road infrastructure. “We don’t know where the zebra cross begins, and traffic lights are useless for us as we cannot see the colour change,” she says. Many like Kumal hope for audio signals at traffic lights to ensure safe and independent road crossings.Sukhdev Ray, 41, who is deaf and lives in Baneshwar, points out a different but equally critical issue: lack of proper signage. “Without clear directional signs in public spaces like pavements, it’s hard for us to find our destinations,” Ray says. “As I can’t hear, I rely on signs for guidance.”Ray also adds that many traffic lights either malfunction or are ignored by drivers. “Crossing the road can be chaotic,” he notes. “With drivers in a rush and traffic lights often disregarded, I often fear getting hit, like I was the last time.”Ray was hit by a motorcycle while walking at Satdobato four months ago. Though he didn’t suffer major injuries, he is still reminded of the incident while walking on the road. He was also hit by a Safa tempo twice in Bhaisepati in June.Sugam Bhattarai, general secretary of the National Federation of the Disabled Nepal (NFDN), acknowledges that the KMC’s new footpaths and railings are a step forward but “they are usually limited to major areas like New Road and lack comprehensive accessibility features.”According to Bhattarai, in Nepal, the term ‘disabled-friendly’ often translates to just adding tactile paving and a ramp, ticking off an ‘inclusivity checklist’ without genuinely addressing accessibility needs. “What about individuals with deafness or intellectual disabilities?” he questions. The Act Relating to Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 2017, and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD), which Nepal has ratified, mandate accessibility to infrastructure.Article 9 of the UNCRPD says, “States Parties shall take appropriate measures to ensure to persons with disabilities access to the physical environment, transportation, information and communications, and other facilities and services open or provided to the public, both in urban and in rural areas.”Despite these legal frameworks, implementation remains inconsistent.Kumal shared that the ongoing pavement widening project at New Road has uprooted both sides of the road, leaving no alternative paths or assistance for the blind. “There’s no guidance or facilities for us,” she said.Shrestha criticises the KMC’s approach for lacking provisions for the blind and visually impaired. “Construction continues without first ensuring alternative routes or proper information,” he said.Nabin Manandhar, spokesperson for the KMC, assures that their pavement widening project at New Road includes considerations for disability access. “While we’re committed to making footpaths accessible, we’re not yet at the stage where we can address all types of disabilities,” he said.“We’ve just started. We welcome suggestions and acknowledge that we can’t address every issue alone.”Baburam Bhattarai, an expert member at the City Planning Commission under the KMC, emphasised that new projects adhere to disability guidelines. “We are monitoring compliance and plan to address issues with old pavements, including complaints about obstructing electric poles,” he said.However, officials blame funding constraints as a barrier in implementing good ideas.In 2021, the Department of Roads allocated Rs50 million for disabled-friendly pavements. The first phase (1.5km from Putalisadak to Thapathali) was completed, but the second phase at Durbarmarg and Jamal was halted due to budget constraints, according to Narayan Dutta Bhandari, division chief of the Road Division of Kathmandu.Rishi said that they, along with the NFDN, will start monitoring construction across the capital. If the right parameters are not followed, they will negotiate with the KMC, even if it means halting the work, he said.“We’ve learned to navigate the inconveniences in Kathmandu’s pavements and roads, but that doesn’t mean they’re not problematic,” Kumal says. “Accessible infrastructure is our right. While we do our best to adapt, we expect the government to adapt to our needs as well.” \nThe Monetary Policy for Fiscal Year 2024-25 issued last Friday by the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB), the monetary authority of Nepal, is generally hailed as expansionary. Nepal’s stock market responded positively to it, triggering a bull run and circuit breaks on Sunday’s trade, the first day of trading after the policy announcement. The Nepal Stock Exchange Index crossed the 2,700 mark after 29 months.The market seemed to have responded positively to the abolition of the Rs200 million ceiling to institutional investors in margin-type lending by the bank and financial institutions, an extension of the loan repayment period for the construction businesses by the end of December 2024, and provision for uncollateralised loans to those going for foreign employment, among others. These, indeed, are more reactive than well-thought-out sustainable policy responses that are unlikely to deliver desirable impacts on containing the severe recessionary trends faced by the economy.Monetary policy-makingFor decades now, Nepal’s monetary policy formulation has been a ritual orchestration rather than a substantive assertion of legally empowered independence by the NRB. The first compromise on monetary policy independence emanated from the fact that the Nepali currency is strictly pegged with the Indian currency. Pragmatically, the pluses of this arrangement may outweigh the minuses for the Nepali economy, so policymakers are not even considering discontinuing it.First, according to the universally acclaimed monetary theory of the impossible trinity, “a country can’t have a fixed exchange rate, independent monetary policy, and free capital movement all at once”. This means that no monetary policy can be ‘independent’ as long as it is pegged with any other currency. But we continue to embrace this impossibility.Second, the central bank shoulders three distinct responsibilities: Controlling inflation, ensuring financial sector stability through supervision and regulation, and, for all practical purposes, functioning as the government's key development finance agency. This reality has often obviated the NRB from an undivided focus on the 'core' central banking functions of money supply, inflation targeting and aversion to systemic risk.Third, the monetary authority and the monetary policy it brings out are often burdened with undue expectations beyond their jurisdiction and capacity. For example, a monetary policy is expected to come out with stimulus packages to ‘rescue’ the economy reeling down the recession, which could be appropriately addressed only by a bold and creative fiscal policy. The monetary policy can only complement this endeavour by managing financial resources for the same.Fourth and the saddest of all, the central bank is exhausting all its autonomy and energy in utterly un-innovative ritualisation of the tasks it should have shed decades ago. For instance, the directed lending policies in the name of the priority sector, deprived sector or the schemes aimed at financial inclusion should no longer be part of monetary policy since they may give rise to a conflict of interests between the roles of a regulator and concessional development financer. The most striking ambiguity of the sort is manifested in the NRB dilemma in dealing with microfinance institutions.The missesThe Monetary Policy appeared as if the central bank was unaware of the current economic malaise and the sources of recalcitrant stagnation. One major sector where the banks have over-invested in the past and suffocated at present is real estate. Except for raising the credit limit from 50 to 70 percent of the valuation to the homeowners with a ‘proven tax file’, the policy has left the land and housing entrepreneurs completely at bay. With India reducing duties on gold imports by 9 percent, as announced in the country’s annual budget last week, the gold market in Nepal, for better or worse, is going to be impacted differently. It will have a bearing on both investment and foreign exchange reserves. The new monetary policy grossly overlooks this phenomenon.Despite repeating a decade-old idea of setting up a second-tier oversight institution to regulate the saving and credit cooperatives and streamlining the operations of the microfinance institutions, the policy has blatantly failed to reinvigorate the small-and-medium-enterprise (SME) ecosystem. At present, the SMEs of Nepal face a grave crisis of legal/official recognition that has, in turn, impeded their access to formal financing mechanisms.The Economic Census of Nepal 2018 has shown that out of 923,356 establishments, only 462,605, or 50.1 percent, are registered. The rest—49.9 percent—have no legal identity. These are important entities providing self-employment and livelihood support to a large population. However, they have hardly any scope to find sizable investments and scale up their operations to enable them to reap the benefits of economies of scale. Again, it must not be misconstrued that the central bank should be directly involved in financing these SMEs. However, as a policy-maker, it should make functional arrangements by engaging relevant stakeholders like the subnational governments to facilitate and recognise grassroots businesses. This reflects the glaring gap in the public policymaking mindset that devolved financial power under federal polity can help optimise implementation, including monetary policy.Flimsy approachSome haphazard and over-ambitious policies have only eroded the central bank’s credibility as the regulator. A provision not to blacklist the contractors deliberately issuing bank checks without adequate balance in their accounts is in direct contravention of the best universal practices in banking.The monetary policy proposes to support the government in achieving an economic growth rate of 6 percent, as proposed by the budget of the current fiscal year, through liquidity management and credit disbursement towards the productive sector. It projects the broad money supply to be at 12.0 percent and credit disbursement to the private sector to grow at 12.5 percent. This means an increase of about Rs660 billion from the current Rs5.3 trillion disbursements of loans.The target is clearly to invest about Rs700 billion worth of loanable funds now lying idle in the system. This is a huge ask considering that during 11 months of the last fiscal year, loans from banks to the private sector increased only by 5.1 percent.The policy also fails to address the risk of alarmingly increasing non-performing assets in the banking system, making the banks more hesitant to invest aggressively. Such policy orchestration does not support the wider agenda of overdue structural reform of the financial system.  \nWhen the Ranjitkar group was established, they discovered this forgotten dance and devoted two years to researching it.Now, they are reintroducing it during Indra Jatra by training the new generation in this traditional art form. \nHe is known for his nationalist legacy, marked by the amendment of Nepal's map to include territories like Kalapani, Lipulekh, and Limpiyadhura, and his strong stance against India, especially during and after the 2015 Nepal blockade.But how did he rise to become the country's powerful man? \nPyakuryal holds a Phd in Public Affairs from the University of Akron, US. In this interview, they discuss Nepal’s elusive political stability, the narratives governing Nepali politics, the role of patriarchy, and the trends in Nepali politics Pyakuryal will be closely following in the years ahead. \n\nWriter and journalist Ghanshyam Khadka has released a new book, ‘Ananda Samhita.’ Known for his novel ‘Nirvana’, Khadka discusses philosophical insights on attaining a joyful life in this latest publication.Khadka's book highlights the issue of human suffering, delving into its root causes and exploring methods to end it to achieve lasting happiness.A statement by the publisher Alchemy reads, “While everyone spends their lives searching for happiness, many end up facing the opposite outcomes, leading to the belief that suffering is the reality of life.” They added, “This book discusses how anyone can achieve happiness under any circumstances if pursued with the right approach.”Each chapter of the book presents a straightforward concept of happiness and a practical method for implementing it.'Aananda Samhita' delves into the philosophical foundations of joy, examining how spirituality, psychology, and daily life intersect. Khadka explores these areas by providing readers with an understanding of joy beyond superficial happiness.The book also analyses different perspectives on happiness, explaining overcoming small and large obstacles in everyday life. \n“Factionalism is unacceptable in our party,” Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, who also chairs the CPN-UML, said at a party meeting on Sunday.Some people might provoke factional feuds on the pretext of strengthening internal democracy in the party, but that is not allowed in the UML, Oli said. “Some of you might take it lightly, arguing that we have heard such dictats since a long time ago,” Oli emphasised. “But it is not something to ignore. It is something to heed seriously.”Oli cautioned the party members against groupism in the party, while administering the oath to the newly appointed vice-chair of the party, Guru Baral, two standing committee members, Mukunda Neupane and Lilanath Shrestha, and 17 central committee members at the party’s central office in Chasyal, Lalitpur on Sunday.Though Chairman Oli ruled against promoting factional activities within the party, some UML leaders accuse him for giving rise to factionalism.It is common practice worldwide to pursue a “two-line struggle” in a communist party. During the party convention, rival leaders often present parallel political documents.While the incumbent party chief presents a political paper, those from the anti-establishment camp float a different paper to counter its ideas. This eventually sets the ground for a two-line struggle in a communist party. Though communists tried to sugarcoat the two-line struggle as a way to rejuvenate party activities and strengthen intra-party democracy, political analysts say such exercise is limited to propping up factions. For Nepali politicians, factions are platforms to exercise power. “When two or more leaders with parallel influential groups exist within the party, that often results in factionalism,” Keshav Dahal, a political analyst, told the Post. “But when there are no leaders to challenge the party’s top leader, there remain fewer chances for groupism.”After a group of UML leaders under former party chiefs Madhav Kumar Nepal and Jhala Nath Khanal split the party to form the CPN (Unified Socialist) in 2021, there was no one to openly challenge Oli. Therefore, the UML doesn’t have a faction now running activities parallel to the party establishment from the centre to the grassroots, which used to be the case in the past.Oli was the one who led a strong faction for many years when Nepal or Khanal was the party chief. Then, why is Oli himself afraid of factional activities in the party?UML leaders say there are no reasons for the party chair to fear from an exercise of intra-party democracy if the top leaders don’t promote factional activities.“It is the duty of the party leader not to engage in factionalism within the party, rather than urging party members not to do so,” Usha Kiran Timilsina, a central committee member of the UML, told the Post. “If the leadership does not promote this, party members will automatically avoid factionalism.”Another UML leader lambasted Oli for being the party's arbitrary leader and a promoter of groupism.A UML standing committee member said the party’s central secretariat meeting on August 1 showed favouritism while deciding a work division among top leaders. He claimed that leaders close to Oli and General Secretary Shankar Pokharel got important responsibilities while others were sidelined.When Prithvi Subba Gurung, the minister for communication and information technology in the Oli Cabinet, is relieved of party responsibilities after becoming minister, Finance Minister Bishnu Paudel of the same Cabinet is given the party’s responsibility as well, the leader told the Post, requesting anonymity.According to the work division decided last week, Paudel still coordinates the monitoring of the party’s organisational activities. Gurung had earlier got the responsibility of leading the party’s parliamentary affairs department. Now Gurung heads no department in the UML.The newly appointed central committee members are loyal to party chair Oli and General Secretary Pokharel, the leader claimed.But Krishna Bhakta Pokharel, who was sworn in as a central member on Sunday, ruled out factionalism in the party. “It was not groupism that party chair Oli pointed to while administering the oath to us,” Pokharel told the Post. “The party chair only tried to make party members aware of the possible foul play against the UML.”Despite being one of the organising members of the 10th general convention of the UML held in Chitwan in November 2021, Pokharel, who earlier was a central committee member and two-time lawmaker, was excluded from the committee.Left-leaning analysts also claim that there is intense rivalry between various groups at the provincial level even if there is no vertical division at present.“But the party is not free from groups exercising parallel activities within the organisation,” Jhalak Subedi, a left-leaning political analyst, told the Post.Political analyst Dahal also claims that even though there are no leaders in UML to challenge the party chair at present, there are struggles between party leaders to project themselves as being close to Oli. The tussle visible among second-rung leaders while picking the chief minister in Lumbini is the latest case in point.When the Congress and the UML decided to form the Lumbini provincial government under the UML’s leadership, many saw UML’s Lumbini Assembly leader Leela Giri as a natural candidate for chief minister.However, Chet Nath Acharya, the deputy leader of the assembly, was appointed the chief minister on July 22. Giri is close to party vice-chair Bishnu Paudel while Acharya is loyal to Pokharel. As General Secretary Pokharel is closer to Oli, the party chief directly instructed Lumbini assembly members of the UML to support Acharya—not Giri. “We are not sure why the party selected Acharya instead of Giri, but we believe it was due to the rivalry between party vice-chair Paudel and General Secretary Pokharel,” a provincial assembly member then told the Post on the condition of anonymity.“Due to the personal rivalry between Paudel and Pokharel, Acharya got the opportunity despite Giri having been considered the chief minister.”During the party's provincial convention held in September last year, Paudel and Pokharel were fiercely engaged in electing leaders loyal to them as the provincial committee chair. The same rivalry was evident while electing the chief minister, according to the leader.Soon after the appointment, Giri had said that if central leaders try to embrace their close supporters while sidelining others, that could sow the seeds of groupism in the party.However, when the Post contacted Giri on Sunday, he refused to comment on the selection of the chief ministerial candidate.Party insiders said that just like the Paudel-Pokharel rivalry in Lumbini, there are similar exercises in other regions as well. For instance, senior leaders Gurung and Khagraj Adhikari are vying for a grip on the party committees in Gandaki Province. \nIn March last year, the National Assembly unanimously endorsed a resolution motion directing the government to end discrimination and oppression against Dalits and ensure their proportional representation in all state agencies and structures.Appearing before the upper house, then-prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal committed to addressing the issues raised in the motion to the fullest extent possible. However, no Dalits were included in the Cabinet and his government overlooked the provision of proportional representation.KP Sharma Oli, who succeeded Dahal, followed suit. The Oli government is without a Dalit Cabinet member. Rupa BK, a junior minister, is the only representative of the community in the 25-member Council of Ministers.Like his predecessor, Oli has also overlooked their representation in other state agencies. Not a single ambassadorial candidate picked for 18 diplomatic missions is a Dalit. Dalits, considered the most marginalised community, comprise 14 percent of Nepal’s population. However, their representation in the state agencies is very low.Dalit lawmakers have taken serious exception to successive governments’ indifference to the resolution motion. On Friday, they voiced their concerns at the Public Policy and Delegated Legislation Committee of the National Assembly and accused the government of perpetuating discrimination against their community. The House committee has got the charge of monitoring the implementation of the motion.“The country has seen various political changes. However, the attitude of a certain group towards Dalits has not changed,” said Jagat Bahadur Parki, a lawmaker from the CPN (Maoist Centre). “I warn those in power that there could be a revolt from the Dalit community if the discrimination continues.”The lawmakers representing the community said Dalits have been discriminated against everywhere including in Parliament. There are 14 committees under the House of Representatives and the National Assembly combined, but none of them has Dalit as its chairperson.“The resolution motion was necessary as little attention was given to implementing the inclusive and non-discriminatory legal and constitutional provisions,” said Tul Prasad Bishwakarma, a Rastriya Janamorcha lawmaker. “Despite the commitment before the sovereign Parliament, nothing has been done to implement it.”A sub-committee to monitor the implementation of the motion held discussions with the secretaries at the prime minister’s office and various ministers in different periods, but without any progress.“No parliamentary committee has summoned responsible government officials to inquire about implementation status of the motion. This needs to be done immediately,” said Bhuwan Bahadur Sunar, coordinator of the monitoring committee.Along with proportional representation, the 19-point motion envisions directing the government to act strictly against all sorts of discrimination in public and private spaces and to ensure proper legal actions against the culprits. It also wants the government to report to the upper house about the steps it has taken to create an equal and equitable environment for the Dalits.The motion’s provisions also include free education for Dalit students up to the university level, and special reservations in vocational and technical education; assurance of social security to people from the community; and incentives to promote inter-caste marriages.“Direct all tiers of governments to allocate budget for the awareness campaign against caste-based discrimination,” reads one of the points in the motion.“Establish the offices of the Dalit Commission in all seven provinces and allocate necessary budget and resources so that they can effectively work to stop discrimination and oppression against Dalits and conduct monitoring.” The motion has pointed out lax implementation of the laws that criminalise caste-based discrimination as a major reason the practice persists in Nepali society.Responding to concerns of the lawmakers, Narayan Dahal, chairperson of the upper house, said it is vital for the entire House to stand together to put pressure on the government to implement the motion. “Caste-based discrimination is not just a Dalit issue, it is a national issue that concerns all. This must be a common issue for everyone,” he said. “It is vital to summon relevant government authorities and give necessary directives for its implementation.” \nWhen the Supreme Court’s verdict in March 2021 dissolved the then Nepal Communist Party (NCP) and revived the CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Centre), most of the leaders returned to their mother parties.A group of Maoist leaders, however, joined the UML. They included some key Maoist leaders such as Ram Bahadur Thapa, Top Bahadur Rayamajhi, Lekh Raj Bhatta, Prabhu Sah and Mani Thapa. Some central committee members and scores of other cadres from various lower committees followed them to join the UML, the bigger communist party among the two.The UML and the Maoist Centre jointly fought the general elections in 2017 and later merged to form the NCP in 2018. But the merger was challenged in court, accusing them of copying the name of a fringe communist party. The Supreme Court in 2021 invalidated the merger, reviving their original parties.While around 30 central level Maoist leaders had joined UML, only a few have succeeded to hold important positions in the UML.CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli on Thursday convened the party’s central secretariat meeting to divide work among the leaders as several of them have become ministers in federal and provincial governments. The same meeting relieved former Maoist leader Mani Thapa of all his positions and roles from the party citing his failure to fulfill the roles and responsibilities assigned by the organisation.Thapa, who was a standing committee member in the UML, however, had reportedly tendered his resignation around a year ago expressing his differences on various issues with the UML leadership.Former key maoist leaders Ram Bahadur Thapa and Lekh Raj Bhatta are now vice-chair and secretary in the UML, respectively. Former Maoist leader Top Bahadur Rayamajhi, who was elected UML secretary in 2022, is now suspended after he is accused in Bhutanese refugee scam. He is now in judicial custody as the case is sub-judice.Prabhu Sah, a prominent Maoist leader of Madhesh Province, quit the UML to form the Aam Janata Party.Lil Bahadur Thapa and Jwala Kumari Sah are politburo members in the UML.According to multiple UML leaders with Maoist background, Mani Thapa remained inactive in the party activities and he also remained inactive during the November 2022 election.A Maoist-turned-UML leader said that the former Maoist Centre leaders, who were given more importance at the time of NCP split and immediately after joining the UML, were gradually sidelined. “That was one of the reasons why Mani Thapa became inactive in party activities,” the leader told the Post requesting anonymity.At the time of the NCP split, UML chair Oli was in serious trouble as the then UML leaders Madhav Kumar Nepal, Jhalanath Khanal, backed by a powerful group of second-rung leaders, had challenged him in the party. At the time, Oli managed to stay in the leadership taking support of the former Maoist leaders.“Thapa was a standing committee member in the UML. I am not aware of what exactly he had expected in the party but he was unhappy,” another UML leader with Maoist background told the Post. “It was Thapa’s personal decision to stay away from party activities. It has nothing to do with the party’s work style.”The Post’s attempts to contact Thapa were unsuccessful.Among the leaders who left the Maoist Centre to join the UML, Ram Bahadur Thapa, Rayamajhi, and Bhatta had played crucial roles in leading the decade-long Maoist insurgency.Some UML leaders with Maoist backgrounds admitted that they get discouraged when the party leadership does not acknowledge the people’s war. At times, UML leaders including chair Oli express critical views against Maoists and their decade-long insurgency.“It is true that UML leadership, especially chair KP Sharma Oli, ruthlessly criticises people’s war, but it is also the fact that both the parties signed a 12-point agreement and agreed to work together for the betterment of the country in 2006,” a former Maoist, currently with the UML, told the Post.The leader said that UML is the suitable option for communists in the country as the Maoist Centre’s political prospects have drastically diminished in recent years. “Though some of their statements on the Maoist insurgency at times cause bitterness, UML is the safest place for us now,” he added.Niru Darlami, another Maoist-turned-UML leader, rubbished the claims that former Maoists were deprived of opportunities in the UML. Some Maoist leaders got a chance to become ministers after joining the UML, says a UML leader.Mani Thapa himself was never given a ministerial position as a Maoist Centre leader but soon after joining the UML, he got the opportunity to lead the Ministry of Water Supply under the KP Sharma Oli government.Similarly, Jwala Kumari Sah held ministerial berths more than three times after joining the UML.Giridharilal Naupane, another UML leader with Maoist background, claimed that the leaders’ former Maoist background was no longer an issue in the UML. “We former Maoist leaders have already been mixed in the UML like sugar in water,” he said. “If some former Maoist leader raises the question to UML, it is due to their misunderstanding.”Meanwhile, some leaders argue that the UML leadership didn’t support Rayamajhi when he got in trouble after being accused in the refugee scam. The party leader still considered Rayamajhi an outsider, they say.“If any UML leader other than Rayamajhi was indicted in the refugee scam, the UML would have made a lot of efforts to release him from custody,” a Maoist-turned-UML leader told the Post on condition of anonymity.However, Maoist-turned-UML leader Tanka Angbuhang, who claims to have met Rayamajhi recently in jail, claims that Rayamajhi himself does not feel the party has alienated him.“During our meeting, Rayamajhi did not show any displeasure to the party,” Aangbuhang told the Post. \nAs Nepal adopted the federal system while promulgating the constitution in 2015, the country’s governance was expected to be more effective with the centralised power being devolved to the seven provinces and local units.However, in practice, provincial leaders are too dependent on the top politicians at the centre when it comes to forming and running the sub-national governments.Though the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML have pledged political stability in the country, observers are not convinced as the two parties too are for rotating the government leadership after some time both at the centre as well as in the provinces.The country’s mixed electoral system has been giving fractured results, resulting in no single party being able to form the government, not only at the centre but also in the seven provinces. The result is that the parties must form coalitions to constitute national as well as subnational governments. Every change of ruling partners at the centre has immediate implications on the provincial level. This was not envisioned while drafting the constitution, according to experts.Before the federal system, the authority was centralised. Even though the country was divided into five development regions and 75 districts, they only served as administrative hubs and centres. The new constitution gives executive as well as legislative powers to the provincial governments. Also, the local governments have all executive, legislative and judicial powers exercised by an elected council.“The country’s federal structure was designed to devolve the central government’s rights to the provinces and local units. But, in practice, the centre has grabbed hold of the provinces’ rights, in the same manner as in the old political structure,” former lawmaker Radheshyam Adhikari of Nepali Congress, who was a member in the Constituent Assembly as well, told the Post. “This was not how the federal structure was envisioned while drafting the constitution.”Blaming the electoral system for the prolonged political instability, the Congress-UML coalition has now vowed to amend the constitution and electoral laws purportedly to ensure stability. However, Adhikari questions the rationale behind such an amendment.“If the political leadership allows provinces to exercise their rights without dictating their daily functions from the centre, the federal system will still work,” he adds. “But they are afraid to give up power that they have been exercising for years to the subnational governments.”The July 1 change in the central coalition caused immediate jolts at the provinces.As per the two-party agreement, the UML formed the government at the centre with the Congress rallying KP Sharma Oli of the second largest party.The two parties also reached an agreement to lead governments in three provinces each while they supported the Janamat Party to form the provincial government in Madhesh. As per the deal, the UML will lead governments in Koshi, Lumbini, and Karnali provinces in the first round while the Congress will take the reins in Bagmati, Gandaki and Sudurpaschim. Except in Sudurpaschim, the governments in the other five provinces have already been formed. Chief Minister of Sudurpaschim Province Dirgha Sodari of the CPN (Unified Socialist), which is now in the opposition coalition, resigned on Friday.This arrangement in the provinces will change again, with the handover in federal government leadership to the Nepali Congress after two years from the day Oli was appointed the prime minister. Prime Minister Oli, reading out the seven-point agreement from the rostrum of Parliament on July 21, said he will lead the federal government for two years, and hand over the mantle to Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba.With the change in leadership at the centre, coalitions in the provinces too are expected to realign. “Even so, there will not be the kind of instability we saw earlier,” says Congress Chief Whip Shyam Kumar Ghimire.With the change of power equations at the centre, the whole dynamics of provincial politics changed, he said. For instance, in under two years, the Koshi government changed five times. “Though the provincial governments’ leadership can change as per the two-party deal, the Congress or the UML will continue to lead, thus providing political stability.” There are already signs of discord in the Congress-UML alliance.Congress and UML leaders have already started disputing power sharing in Gandaki Province, where Congress is leading the government.UML provincial leaders have been warning Gandaki Chief Minister Surendra Pandey of the Congress not to take long-term decisions as they expressed reservations over some of his moves. While forming the two-party coalition, the leaders said they wanted to ensure political stability, among other things. But political observers aren’t very optimistic. “The agreement between the two major parties says the leadership of the provincial governments will be rotated within an agreed timeframe. This will only lead to more instability,” Pitambar Bhandari, a political observer, told the Post. “The way our political parties are trying to run the federal structure, there could soon be a systemic crisis.” \nThe Lions Club of Kathmandu Corporate, Nepal MD325-D has felicitated various personalities as part of its endeavour to recognise the contribution of the individuals and business entities for the society.As part of its campaign, the Lions Club of Kathmandu honoured Prateek Pradhan with Social Journalism Award, Sylapa T Rimponche with Social Spiritual Award, Erika Gurung with Social Player Award, Ramesh Corporation with Social Corporate House Award, Rajendra Malla with Social Corporate Leader Award and Rajesh Hamal with Social Celebrity Award.Likewise, Chandra Ghimire is honoured with Social Bureaucratic Award, Binod Das with Sports Management Award, Anil Kedia with Social Academic Award, Mohan Ojha with Social Management Award and Surya Nepal with Corporate Social Responsibility Award.The Lionism embarked in Nepal in 1971 as the Lions Club of Biratnagar under the stewardship of former Prime Minister Matrika Prasad Koirala.The Lions Clubs International says it has over 2,000 clubs operating across the nation. \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City has resumed pavement widening in the New Road area from Wednesday. Officials at the Public Construction Department under the metropolis said that the contractor resumed the work after the High Court, Patan issued an interim order paving the way for following an interim order from the High Court, Patan allowing the work to proceed. “Now there is no obstruction from locals nor from federal government agencies,” said Baburam Bhattarai, a member of the City Planning Commission under the KMC. “We hope that the project will be completed at the earliest.”The metropolis had awarded a contract to widen the sidewalks by 1.5 metres along both sides of the road section between the New Road gate and the Juddha Statue roundabout in the last fiscal year. The work started in the New Road area in May, but a jurisdictional dispute between the city office and the Road Division, Kathmandu, caused the project to come to a halt. The division confiscated contractors’ equipment, and the federal government deployed police in to prevent the city office from working. Some local residents, too, had demonstrated against the pavement widening plan. The division had even repaired the parts of roads cut for pavement expansion.And on June 9, the metropolis moved the High Court challenging the breach of jurisdiction by the road division, which is a federal agency, and its intervention in the city’s work.City officials were already frustrated by the years-long delay by federal agencies in completing another project, the widening of Kathmandu’s Ring Road in the Kalanki-Maharajgunj section, which has caused huge inconvenience to the public due to dust and mud.Mayor Balendra Shah then directed city officials to dump truckloads of dirt from the Ring Road section in front of the main entrance of the Road Division office at Minbhawan, accusing federal agencies of delaying the work.The 8.2km Kalanki-Maharajgunj section was set to be widened by the Chinese government, and the work was initially planned to start in early 2020, but the project has not progressed even after years due to Covid and delays in clearing the power poles and in some cases structures along the right of way.Regarding the jurisdiction dispute over the sidewalk widening work in the city, a division bench of judges Dhurba Raj Nand and Prakash Kharel at the High Court Patan issued an interim order in favour of the metropolis on Sunday.The City office has already widening pavements by 1 metre on both sides in the Bhrikutimandap area. “Neither did the federal government agency intervene, nor did locals object while expanding pavement in the Bhrikutimandap area by narrowing the road,” said Bhattarai. “Further decisions on pavement widening in other areas like Thamel, Handigaun and others will be taken after collecting public feedback.”Officials said that the long-term plan is to restrict motor vehicles altogether in the New Road area due to heavy pedestrian traffic. “We have also been working to find a solution to the parking problem and weighing various options including setting up multi-storey parking facilities,” said Bhattarai, who is also an urban planner.Officials said that pavements in the New Road area, which always remain crowded, should be widened to ensure free pedestrian movement. Officials claimed that New Road residents have also requested the city office to expand the pavement.According to city officials, local residents have, from time to time, complained about feeling unsafe and experiencing sexual harassment on the narrow and crowded sidewalks. \nIn a bid to prevent garbage from piling up on streets during the monsoon, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City has deployed heavy equipment including bulldozers, excavators, and loaders, to clear the road to the landfill site. Officials said the move aims to ensure smooth transfer of waste as roads to the landfill often become impassable during the monsoon, preventing the passage of garbage trucks.“We have deployed three excavators, two bulldozers and two loaders to clear landslide debris along the road to the Bancharedanda landfill,” said Rabinman Shrestha, chief of the Environment Department at the metropolis. “Also, we have kept five more vehicles on standby for immediate deployment if needed.”Every year, during monsoon season, the road to landfill sites gets obstructed in multiple places, obstructing the transfer of house waste collected in the three districts of the capital city—Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur. Apart from these, some local levels of Kavrepalanchok also discard garbage at the landfill site at Bancharedanda.The metropolis officials said that they had purchased 10 high-pressure pumps to drain floodwaters from inundated settlements.“Five pumps have already been sent to the high-risk areas along riversides,” said Shrestha. “These can quickly pump away floodwaters.”The city office started repairing the Sisdole road leading to the Bancharedanda landfill in Nuwakot district just a few weeks before the start of the monsoon. Officials said Rs30 million had been allocated for repairs, which included fixing potholes, concreting roads, and other works.Around 200 metres of road near the Sisdole area, which is often damaged by garbage trucks and excavators, will be concretised, according to officials.Besides monsoon-induced road obstructions, garbage disposal is sometimes disrupted due to obstructions by the residents living in settlements near and around the landfill site. These obstructions cause weeks-long halt to door-to-door garbage collection, leading people in the Valley to discard their trash on streets.Officials said that a high-pressure pump is being used to prevent the overflow of leachate from the dumping ground.Landfill leachate is a hazardous liquid containing harmful bacteria, chemicals and other components. It forms when rainwater passes through a landfill or when organic matter decomposes naturally.Officials say the leachate needs to be re-injected into the landfill, which quickens the decomposition process of the landfill waste and prevents the liquid from flowing into the river. The City office has also started segregating degradable and bio-non-degradable waste materials from households in its seven wards. Wards 5, 7, 10, 12, 24 and 27 have been segregating the waste materials generated in the households. The city office has also arranged separate trucks for collecting segregated waste materials from the households.Degradable waste materials are being turned into compost at the KMC’s waste transfer station. Officials said that the metropolis has also been using reagents to expedite the compost-making process.The city office recently sold non-degradable waste worth Rs700,000.Waste segregation at the source was one of the measures Mayor Balendra Shah touted as a solution to Kathmandu’s chronic garbage problem. After he assumed office, Shah asked city residents to start segregating waste at the source. They started doing so, using separate bins in their homes. But the plan didn’t work, largely due to a lack of preparations on the KMC’s part.The Kathmandu Valley generates over 1,200 tonnes of solid waste every day, nearly 60 percent of which comes from the KMC alone. Experts say 60 percent of organic waste originating in the Valley can be converted into compost and the remaining 30 percent of non-degradable waste can be recycled. \nCome autumn, Nepal will deploy heavy lifter drones to transport garbage from the 6,812-metre tall Ama Dablam, south of Everest. This will be the first commercial work an unmanned aerial vehicle does in Nepal’s high-altitude zone.The heavy lifter from China’s biggest drone maker, Da Jiang Innovations (DJI), will take on tasks traditionally handled by Sherpas. Officials believe it will help reduce casualties on Everest.Then, in spring (March-May), DJI drones, which make sounds similar to a swarm of bees, will be put to work on Everest.It will fly to Camp I (5,943 metres) to supply ropes and ladders to prepare routes and bring garbage to the Everest base camp at 5,364 metres.On Sunday, a tripartite memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed between the Sagarmatha Pollution Control Committee, the Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Rural Municipality, and the Airlift Technology Pvt Ltd for the use of advanced drone technology to efficiently manage garbage in the mountains of the Khumbu region.In April, Chinese drone maker DJI conducted the world’s first drone delivery test on Everest.“After a successful test in April, we plan to use drones commercially in the Everest region,” said Jagat Bhusal, chief administration officer of the rural municipality that hosts Everest. The test result showed that the DJI FlyCart 30, the long-distance heavy lifter drone, could airlift 234 kg per hour between Camp I and Base Camp, a task usually accomplished by at least 14 porters in six hours. Drone manufacturer DJI is under the microscope as US lawmakers push for a ban on Chinese drones, amid deteriorating relations between the US and China, the world’s largest trading nations.Nepali officials and mountaineers, however, see the drone as a life-saving vehicle.Traditionally, local Sherpa guides are responsible for transporting supplies and clearing trash on Everest. They may need to cross the icefall over 30 times a season to transport supplies such as oxygen bottles, gas canisters, tents, food, and ropes.All climbers and guides must navigate the icefall on the route to the world’s tallest peak. The icefall is so notoriously dangerous that even experienced Sherpas hesitate to move when the sun shines.The Khumbu Icefall, a river of ice a kilometre or so long, is usually crossed at night or early morning, with climbers putting headlamps on their helmets.Normally, the route is crossed early in the morning, when the ice blocks and the hanging glaciers are stable and avalanche risks are low.During the day, as the sun warms the mountain, the hanging glaciers melt, and ice crumbles, increasing the risk of avalanche.“Using drones will help us avoid the dangers in the Khumbu Icefall,” said Bhusal. On April 18, 2014, an avalanche resulting from a falling serac buried 16 Sherpa guides in the Khumbu Icefall, eventually leading to the cancellation of the season’s expeditions.Last year, three Sherpa guides mobilised to prepare the routes were buried under the ice masses triggered by an avalanche in the Khumbu Icefall. Their bodies are yet to be recovered.The Himalayan Database and the government records show that nearly 50 individuals died on the icefall between 1953 and 2023.The climb from Everest Base Camp to Camp I takes six hours. Between these two camps lies the Khumbu Icefall, the most treacherous part of the route.The most exciting and easiest part of the route is reaching Camp II (6,400 metres), which takes four hours from Camp I.There is a set of restrictions in the mountains for carrying loads.According to government rules, workers climbing high altitudes must not carry loads exceeding 20kg between 5,000 and 6,000 metres, 17 kg between 6,001 and 7,000 metres, 14 kg between 7,001 to 8,000 metres, and 12 kg for altitudes above 8,000 metres.“Yes, there are concerns that the machines may actually cut jobs. But our sole purpose is to reduce potential deaths in the Khumbu Icefall, the danger zone,” said Bhusal.“We will train Sherpas, as drone operators cannot handle tasks at the higher camps. In the future, all work will be done by Sherpas.” In the trial phase, the drone could lift 30 kg from Camp I. However, its performance dropped to 18 kg from Camp II. “Based on the MoU framework, we will soon sign a commercial agreement with the drone supplier,” said Bhusal. “The municipality will monitor all the activities.”The municipality has, so far, spent Rs800,000 on the trial. Climate change is melting snow and ice, exposing even more garbage and bodies that have been covered for decades on Everest. This waste pollutes the natural environment and poses a severe health risk to everyone who lives in the Everest watershed.Nearly 100 tonnes of garbage were collected during this spring climbing season from Everest and Lhotse, which share the same base camp.According to the Sagarmatha Pollution Control Committee (SPCC), 77.19 tonnes of waste was collected from the Everest base camp alone during the Spring 2024 climbing season. With 8-9 tonnes coming from the higher camps brought down by the expedition agencies, the SPCC collected 85 tonnes of waste this spring.The breakdown of collected waste shows burnable garbage at 27.99 tonnes, recyclable garbage at 7.51 tonnes, human waste at 27.53 tonnes, and kitchen waste at 14.15 tonnes. The Nepal Army also collected over 11 tonnes of garbage. In Spring 2023, the SPCC managed nearly 70 tonnes of waste from expedition groups.Insiders say the Everest Base Camp has become more luxurious, leading to an accumulation of people and garbage. Nearly 60,000 people trek to the Base Camp annually.Since 2015, the SPCC has enforced the 8 kg garbage rule, requiring every climber ascending the Everest base camp to return with at least 8 kg of garbage. Visitors to Everest must also pay a $4,000 garbage deposit, which is refunded if the person returns with 8 kg.Before this year’s climbing season, the Supreme Court issued a mandamus order directing the government to regulate the rising number of expeditions on the world’s tallest mountain.The court order followed frequent traffic jams and increasing trash on Everest, which has even been called the ‘world's highest garbage dump’.“Drones can replace helicopters as a relatively low-risk transport vehicle to supplement supplies on the plateau, which will greatly expand the application space of UAVs,” Cai Yong, a senior engineer at East China Normal University, told Xinhua, the state news agency of China, after the April test.In recent years, more electric drones have been used in agriculture and forestry, power line inspection, logistics, and emergency rescue, and each breakthrough will help save human and material resources and protect the safety of life and property, Jin Wei, deputy secretary-general of the China UAV Industry Innovation Alliance, told Xinhua.The April tests used the DJI FlyCart 30 to fly three bottles of oxygen and 1.5 kg of other supplies from the base camp to Camp I of the world's highest peak and to carry garbage down on the return trip.During the tests, the DJI FlyCart 30 flew up to 6,191.8 metres on Everest, which straddles the Nepal-China border.  \nA year after rolling out the Nepal Trade Integration Strategy (NTIS), Nepal’s export of high-value products grew at a snail's pace in the last fiscal year.According to the statistics from the Trade and Export Promotion Centre, the export of high-value goods increased by 10 percent in the review period.NTIS 2023, which supersedes NTIS 2016, was implemented from the beginning of last fiscal year. The latest trade strategy is meant to support Nepal's graduation from the least developed country (LDC) status to a developing country by 2026.As per the statistics, export earnings from the goods identified by NTIS 2023 totalled Rs110.38 billion in the review period.Nepal’s total export amounted to Rs152.38 billion in the last fiscal year.The aim of NTIS 2023 is to diversify the export market for which a country-wise strategy was said to be prepared and implemented. But little has been done towards that end.“It’s true. Few works have been done for the implementation of the latest trade strategy and the result is not as expected,” said an official at the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies requesting anonymity. There are problems in production, quality entrepreneurship development and global price competitiveness in the implementation of trade strategy. “We have started consultation with the private sector and stakeholders since the beginning of the current fiscal year regarding the legal, resource and other aspects of effective implementation of a trade strategy in the current fiscal year,” said the official.The ministry has got a budget of Rs34.5 million for the implementation of NTIS in the current fiscal year. Officials said that budget constraint is one of the problems in the full implementation of the trade strategy.According to the latest NTIS estimation, around Rs463 billion will be required for its implementation.The major target of NTIS 2023 is to attain Nepal’s trade-to-GDP ratio of 55 percent by 2026 from 43.81 percent in 2021. Trade is the sum of exports and imports of goods and services measured as a share of the gross domestic product (GDP).Proper coordination among the ministries and government bodies concerned is crucial for an effective implementation of the trade strategy but in the lack of the coordination there is a problem in budget mobilisation.“The development of entrepreneurship and its ecosystem from the private sector and increase in the government’s capital expenditure are also required to achieve the objective of NTIS.”Trade experts have been stressing for long that as Nepal is preparing to graduate from the “least developed” status by 2026, the increase in the export of high-value goods is not satisfactory which is not a good sign for the graduation.“The performances of former NTIS-listed goods were not good, demonstrating that Nepal failed to develop the products’ value chain. Making plans alone doesn’t work if they are not properly executed,” said Purushottam Ojha, former commerce secretary and trade expert in a recent interview with the Post. “There are problems in increasing and enhancing production, assuring quality and marketing Nepali products.”A major implication of LDC graduation is the loss of preferential market access available through LDC-specific schemes under the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) and other arrangements.After LDC graduation, Nepal may lose a huge European market as it might not get facilities under the Everything But Arms (EBA) initiative. This scheme grants full duty-free and quota-free access to the European Union Single Market for all products (except arms and ammunition).There are around 184 activities for the implementation of the NTIS and provision requiring monitoring and evaluation. But the monitoring mechanism does not seem to have done its work, a trade expert said. There should be a dedicated review after a certain time gap, which helps focus on problematic issues.The export of iron and steel products, readymade garment, fabrics, medicinal herbs, cement, footwear, lentils, fruits, honey and textile, yarn and rope has increased in the last fiscal year.Shipment of iron and steel rose by 60 percent to Rs17.40 billion during the review period, making it top exportable goods from listed products. The export of iron and steel contributed 11.4 percent in total export share.Export of textile, yarn and rope increased by 30.09 percent to Rs19.22 billion contributing second largest export from Nepal. The export of textile, yarn and rope contributed 12.6 percent to the total export.Readymade garment export increased by 9.12 percent to Rs8.96 billion in the review period.The export of fabrics increased by 6.68 percent to Rs2.52 billion while medicinal herbs shipment increased by 19.27 percent to Rs2.25 billion.Cement shipment jumped by 449.05 percent to Rs1.97 billion during the review period. Footwear exports grew by 22.84 percent to Rs1.32 billion.Nepal’s lentils export increased by 14.12 percent to Rs568.47 million while fruits export jumped 517 percent to Rs19.02 million. The export of honey rose by 210.83 percent to Rs57.47 million.The exports of carpet, readymade garment, cardamom, jute and related products, felt products, dog food, pashmina, rosin and resin acid, ginger, handmade paper, silver and gold jewellery, vegetable, tea, coffee and spice fell in the last fiscal year compared to the previous one.Shipments of carpet from Nepal declined by 8.12 percent to Rs10.57 billion while cardamom export declined by 4.06 percent to Rs7.94 billion.Exports of jute and processed goods fell by 7.86 percent to Rs7.04 billion.Shipment of felt products dropped by 8.18 percent to Rs4.79 billion in the review period.Dog chew export came down by 6.59 percent to Rs3.18 billion in the last fiscal year. Shipment of pashmina also fell 5.32 percent to Rs3.02 billion.Export of rosin and resin acids declined by 10.51 percent to Rs1.47 billion. Shipment of Nepali paper declined by 10.18 percent to Rs1.02 billion.Gold and silver jewellery exports declined by 69.14 percent and 22.39 respectively to Rs58.23 million and Rs167.05 million accordingly.Nepal’s tea, coffee and spice exports shrank by 4.48 percent to Rs13.44 billion.Shipment of pasta fell by 14.38 percent to Rs1.96 billion during the review period. \nAt the Nepal Tourism Board, the country’s tourism promotional body, crises appear to be hovering all around again.Politicking at the board, which operates under a public-private partnership model, has been a long-standing problem, affecting its national and international tourism promotional plans for decades.Political manoeuvring becomes rampant when the time for appointing a chief executive officer (CEO) begins every four years. And the key tourism promotional body is already headless.Apart from the politics over the chief’s appointment, the board has yet to introduce its annual budget, a serious matter for the agency promoting Nepal abroad.“The board is in severe crisis,” said a top board official. The crisis arrived after most countries launched free-visa policies to attract tourists.Nepal plans to draw 1.6 million tourists this year, but that will not be possible without promotions. Amid all this, the country’s poor air safety has further hindered tourism growth, the official said. There is now tough global competition to attract tourists.Laos is extending its visa exemption policy and increasing visa validity for tourists from certain countries.The Thai cabinet has rolled out a series of new visa promotions, including visa-free and visa-on-arrival schemes, extended student stays, and reduced compulsory health insurance for retirees. Under the new scheme, visitors can stay in Thailand for up to 60 days, compared to the earlier limit of 30 days.Indonesia plans to introduce visa-free entry for tourists from 20 nations, including India, by October this year.In December last year, Malaysia granted visa-free entry to citizens of China and India for up to 30 days.Zimbabwe is giving a leg up to its tourism industry with a new visa-free entry policy for 35 countries.However, poor planning, unstable politics, and plane crashes have marred Nepal’s tourism, the country’s economic growth engine, at a time when most economic indicators are dim.The tourism board has been headless since January 30 when the term of its former CEO Dhananjay Regmi ended.On top of that, the board is yet to present its annual budget. “We are on a budget holiday,” said Mani Raj Lamichhane, spokesman for the Nepal Tourism Board. “From Sunday, there will be not a penny to spend on day-to-day activities.”As per the board’s financial bylaws, it has to bring the full budget by July 9. If the budget is not passed by then, it can manage expenses for day-to-day activities through a partial budget up to August 9. And there is a mandatory provision of passing the budget by August 19. If the budget is not passed by August 19, the tourism board may face a legal crisis. “We don’t know what will happen in that case,” said another senior board official.Officials say that given the ongoing crisis, the full budget seems impossible.Last fiscal year, the board earned Rs1.04 billion in tourism promotional fees charged to foreigners who departed from Kathmandu’s Tribhuvan International Airport, the main source of its budget. However, only 30 percent of it has been spent. The board estimates that it will introduce a Rs1.25 billion budget this fiscal year.Lamichhane said they met Tourism Minister Badri Pandey on Wednesday, and the minister assured them that the budget would be passed.Officials say frequent government changes have affected the functioning of the board, creating a leadership vacuum. Power tussles have become common among the board of directors, appointed by different ministers belonging to different parties at different times. “In the board of directors, the members face four different directions. No agendas can be approved.”The 11-member Nepal Tourism Board comprises five representatives, each from the government and the private sector, and the CEO. The tourism secretary chairs the board.As per the law, even a six-member board can pass the budget. “We don’t know what’s stopping the tourism secretary, the board chair, from doing that,” said the official.The CEO appointment, too, seems uncertain. As per the process, a three-member CEO selection committee should be formed to appoint the chief.The sub-committee shortlists three candidates based on their presentations and interviews and submits their names to the board, ultimately selecting the CEO within 90 days of the committee’s formation.After Regmi’s term ended, the board of directors initiated the process of appointing a new CEO. However, the applications were invited only on April 6. Twenty individuals, including Regmi, had applied for the executive position. The sub-committee had shortlisted 16 candidates. However, this was challenged when a writ petition was filed at the Patan High Court questioning the legality of the sub-committee members.On April 29, the joint bench of High Court Judges Sudarshan Dev Bhatta and Kailash Prasad Subedi continued the short-term interim order issued on April 22, ordering the halt of the CEO selection process. The next hearing was scheduled for Sunday. However, the government has declared Sunday a public holiday, on the occasion of Bhoto Jatra. On this day, the Machhindranath chariot festival concludes with the showing of the legendary vest at Jawalakhel in Lalitpur.Kundan Sharma Mishra, an official at the tourism board, filed the writ petition, contesting the legality of the two board members Milan Devkota and Madan Kumar Acharya, who were nominated to the CEO selection subcommittee. The director general of the Department of Tourism is another subcommittee member.“As per the law, the Cabinet should appoint board members. But it was former tourism minister Prem Ale who appointed the two board members. This minister-level decision is illegal. If the appointment is illegal, the CEO they select will also be illegal,” said Mishra.Devkota and Acharya were appointed in March 2022.The CEO appointment process had run into controversy even in the past.In 2011, the board had shortlisted 12 applicants in the first week of November.However, it was four years later, in December 2015, that the CEO was appointed. In that period, more than two dozen writs were filed in courts to halt or postpone the appointment process.The tourism board, established in 1998 under the public-private partnership model, is mandated to promote Nepal in domestic and international markets.But the board soon became a political playground. \nNepal has eased the foreign exchange facility for Nepali travellers, traders, and those with dollar accounts as the central bank is awash with foreign currencies, with a historic high of reserves.As of mid-June, the 11th month of the last fiscal year, the country had Rs1.96 trillion in foreign exchange reserves. The Nepal Rastra Bank’s own stock amounts to Rs1.75 trillion.The central bank said on Thursday that it amended the unified directives to allow Nepali citizens travelling abroad to carry $2,500 per trip. Earlier, Nepali citizens were allowed $2,500 twice a year.“Two years ago, we set the limitation on foreign exchange facilities in view of the country’s depleting foreign exchange reserves. Now we have amended the unified guidelines and removed the frequency limit as resources have improved. It will be helpful for frequent travellers,” said Ramu Paudel, spokesperson for the central bank.However, the limit of the amount of currency available remains unchanged. The amendments are based on the central bank's recently announced monetary policy for the current fiscal year.Similarly, the central bank has doubled the foreign currencies available to Nepali citizens travelling to Tibet, China, and the SAARC countries. Nepali citizens travelling to Tibet via surface route can now get an exchange facility of $1,000 one time and $2,000 in a fiscal year. This will also apply to Nepalis travelling to the SAARC countries, excluding India, via surface route.This provision, however, will not apply to the residents of border regions who make frequent travels to Tibet.The country’s foreign currency stock has been breaking records in recent months, mainly due to a robust remittance growth and ever-increasing migrant departures to foreign lands in search of better incomes.Economists say that robust forex reserves suggest a scenario of low investments, particularly in a least developed country like Nepal.In June 2022, Nepal’s foreign exchange reserves slid to a critical level that could sustain imports of goods for less than six months. Even the central bank's import controls did not improve the situation.Instead, the measures nearly suffocated Nepal’s economy, according to the International Monetary Fund.Following the Russia-Ukraine war, which choked the global supply system and caused prices to rise like never before, Nepal, too, suffered chronic current account deficits and was increasingly vulnerable to external economic shocks, while forex reserves dwindled fast.In late April 2022, the government banned imports of at least 10 goods considered luxury or non-essential in a bid to stop the country’s foreign exchange reserves from depleting further. The ban was lifted in December 2022.Paudel said that the foreign exchange ceiling has gone higher not only due to the improving forex reserve situation but also to prevent the hassles that travellers and traders are facing.People who travel frequently despite the limited forex convertibility were facing the problem of submitting documents required by the central bank, he said. “The amended provision will help such travellers.”The central bank has also amended the foreign exchange limitation for traders.According to the amended provision, traders who import goods through demand draft and telegraphic transfer are allowed to import goods of $100,000 at once, up from $60,000 before.Paudel said that the traders ordering goods beyond the limitations are required to submit documents to the central bank.But with the amendment, they can access needed facilities from any commercial bank.The amended provision has increased the payment limitation to import silver.Bullion traders importing silver to produce silver jewellery, artistic goods, and utensils, among other things, can get a foreign exchange facility of $300,000 per import. The other bullion traders importing silver can get a foreign exchange facility of $100,000 per import.The foreign exchange limitation for companies outsourcing services from foreign countries and invisible imports by domestic companies and their sister concerns has increased to $25,000 monthly from $15,000 monthly. \nAmid monsoon rains causing widespread death and destruction, the risk of infection of water- and vector-borne diseases intensifies.Officials at the Ministry of Health and Population are bracing for tough days ahead, as the escalating monsoon not only pollutes sources of drinking water but also provides breeding grounds for various disease-spreading vectors.“Over 2,000 people from 73 districts have already tested positive for the dengue virus and several districts have witnessed outbreaks of waterborne diseases, including cholera,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “We are aware of the possible risks and have alerted the relevant agencies.”The division said that 23 cholera cases have already been confirmed in Lalitpur, Kailali and Kathmandu districts. Likewise, as many as 2,061 people from 73 districts have tested positive for dengue. Health facilities across the country have been grappling with a surge in water- and vector-borne diseases. “Infection of the dengue virus has not risen this time compared to the previous years,” said Ghimire. “Ongoing rain has contaminated drinking water sources which increases the risk of potential outbreaks of waterborne diseases in the coming days.”According to data provided by the division, among the 73 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases at 249, followed by Jhapa 130, Chitwan 105, Tanahun 87, Makawanpur 78, Kaski 74, Bhojpur 62, Kavrepalanchok 60, and Okhaldhunga with 59 cases.Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika, according to the World Health Organisation.Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. Likewise, cholera is a highly infectious disease that causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting, which in turn results in dehydration and can lead to death within a few hours if left untreated. The World Health Organisation says cholera is a global threat to public health and an indicator of inequality and a lack of social development.Health officials said that the Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool samples of the infected patients. They concede that the outbreaks of the deadly disease are being reported only from the districts having active case surveillance programmes. Active cholera surveillance is being carried out from 27 health facilities in Kathmandu Valley and 10 in Kailali district.The monsoon season in Nepal is a time of epidemics during which thousands of people across the country become infected with waterborne and vector-borne diseases. Officials warned that health facilities could witness an uptick in the number of viral fever cases, and waterborne diseases—diarrhoea, dysentery, food poisoning, and snakebites—in the coming days.The Ministry of Health and Population last month urged provincial and local health authorities not to grant leave to health workers during the monsoon season and step up vigilance about the potential risks.Officials say that they have been raising awareness through all available means to inform people of the risks and directed agencies concerned to stockpile essential medicines.Doctors say the only ways to prevent deaths from waterborne diseases, including diarrhoea, are to raise awareness and ensure safe drinking water.They say a combination of careful surveys, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation and treatment are required to contain the spread of the diarrhoeal infection. \nAt least 20 diarrhoeal patients—12 from Lalitpur, eight from Kailali and two from Kathmandu—were found to have contracted cholera recently. People residing in other districts may have also been infected with the deadly disease, but due to absence of an active cholera surveillance programme in most of the districts, no one knows what is going on.“Active cholera surveillance is being carried out only in the three districts of the Valley—Kathmandu, Lalitpur and Bhaktapur—and in Kailali,” said Dr Hemanta Chandra Ojha, an official at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “We have a system in place in other districts as well but intensive surveillance is being carried out in Kathmandu Valley and in Kailali only.”Cholera is a highly infectious disease that causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting, which in turn results in dehydration and can lead to death within a few hours if left untreated. The World Health Organisation says cholera is a global threat to public health and an indicator of inequality and a lack of social development.Health officials said that the Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool samples of the infected patients. They concede that the outbreaks of the deadly disease are being reported from the districts having active case surveillance programmes. Active cholera surveillance is being carried out from 27 health facilities in the Valley and 10 in Kailali district.“Report of cholera outbreak in districts having intensive cholera surveillance is an obvious thing, as we carry out testing only when we find problems,” said an official at the Department of Health Services, asking not to be named as he is not authorised to talk to the media. “We will not know anything about the cause of disease outbreaks, if we stopped testing.”Officials at the Ministry of Health and Population, however, claimed that even if active cholera surveillance programmes are not in place in most of the districts, systems are in place to collect stool samples of the diarrhoeal patients and send them for lab testing if needed.“We have provincial public health laboratories in all provinces that can carry out cholera testing, and we also bring samples to the National Public Health Laboratory for examination when a massive diarrheal outbreak occurs,” said Ojha of the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “We have an Integrated Health Information Management System and Early Warning, Alert and Response System, which reports about the disease outbreaks. Active surveillance is being carried out only in high risk districts.”Officials, who wish not to be quoted in news as they fear retribution for speaking to the media, however, said that Integrated Health Information Management System only provides monthly reports; moreover, the system provides only clinical reports, not the reports of lab testing. The Early Warning, Alert and Response System is also not very effective.“The thing is systems on which health authorities rely much do not give an exact picture of the disease outbreak, and such systems do not help contain massive outbreaks,” the official said. “Major outbreaks of waterborne disease could happen at any time and at any place, and authorities concerned get alerted only after loss.”Health officials concede that it is not the government that is carrying out active surveillance of the deadly disease in four districts but the International Vaccine Institute, Korea. When asked why the government does not think it necessary to carry out active cholera surveillance in other districts, they said that the existing health budget is insufficient for the task.Cholera outbreaks during the monsoon season are not a new thing in Nepal, as hundreds of people throughout the country suffer from diarrhoeal infections that continue for months every year and scores contract the disease.In 2022, a total of 77 cholera cases were confirmed in the Valley. Last year, health authorities administered an oral cholera vaccine in Kathmandu Metropolitan City’s wards 11, 12, and 13, which were highly affected by the outbreak.Public health experts say that due to poor sanitation and hygiene conditions, the country as a whole is highly vulnerable to water-borne illnesses including diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid, hepatitis, and cholera, with thousands of people getting infected every year.They say sheer negligence from authorities concerned is responsible for ongoing outbreak of diarrhoeal diseases including the deadly cholera.Health authorities in most local units had stopped the testing of drinking water just before the start of the monsoon season, citing lack of funds, although deadly microbes such as faecal coliform and E coli were frequently detected in drinking water samples.Faecal coliform and E coli, both microscopic organisms, are found in human faeces. According to doctors, the presence of faecal coliform and E coli in drinking water means it is contaminated with sewage.Doctors say bottled water, which is widely used by households and offices in Kathmandu Valley, is generally considered safe, but water quality of several companies have been found questionable. Dangerous microbes are detected in bottled water every year, which means not all jar water brands are safe to drink without treatment.Doctors have asked authorities to launch awareness drives against water-borne diseases and ensure safe drinking water to prevent deaths from illnesses like cholera.To contain the spread of the infection, a combination of careful surveys, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation, and treatment is required, according to doctors.The World Health Organisation also said that a multifaceted approach is key to controlling cholera and reducing deaths. \nThe polio immunisation drive launched in the Kathmandu Valley a week ago has achieved an impressive 104 percent coverage rate. This is not the first time coverage rate of a healthcare campaign has exceeded 100 percent.What concerns public health experts is that even if the coverage of the health campaign exceeds 100 percent every time, post-campaign surveys reveal actual coverage falling short.“We don’t have the exact count of the floating population or those living in the city slums,” said Dr Arjun Spkota, chief of Health Office Kathmandu. “Moreover there are refugees in the capital. Providing healthcare programmes to these groups is always a challenge. Chances of children missing vaccination or other health campaigns is always high in big and crowded cities like in the Kathmandu Valley.”Health authorities launched a special immunisation programme in the three districts of the Valley—Kathmandu, Lalitpur and in Bhaktapur—following the detection of a highly contagious poliovirus in sewage samples.Officials say that presence of type-3 poliovirus in sewage samples has been confirmed by the National Institute of Health of Thailand, a World Health Organisation’s collaborating centre. The virus, which originated from a vaccine, was detected in sewage samples collected from the confluence of the Tukucha and Bagmati Rivers [in Kathmandu] on May 26, according to them.Nepal has been polio-free since 2010, but was officially declared polio-free by the World Health Organisation only on March 27, 2014, after maintaining zero polio cases for three consecutive years.After having zero human cases of polio for about 14 years, the infectious disease has surfaced in the capital city’s sewage, which is a serious problem, according to public health officials. They said that the presence of poliovirus in sewage samples indicates the looming risk of an outbreak.The Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services had planned to carry out a four-day polio vaccination in all three districts of the Valley from July 24 but later extended for a week.All children under five years of age have been inoculated with an additional dose of oral polio vaccine in the drive.Oral polio vaccine, which consists of Type-1 and Type-3 polioviruses have been administered during the campaign. Health workers and female community health volunteers were deployed to homes, schools, bus parks, and entry points to ensure that no eligible children miss the vaccine. “We found over 3,000 children living in city slums,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section. “We are aware that children might still miss the vaccine despite our best efforts to meet the target.”The health ministry said that the vaccine coverage rate for polio is 95 throughout the country. An estimated 300,000 children live in three districts of the Valley. But the 104 percent coverage rate shows that more children reside in the Valley than estimated. Health authorities do not have exact data on the people residing in the city slums. Floating population, scattered slums, high density of working-class people, and lack of awareness and poor access to health services are some of the challenges identified in improving health indicators, experts say. They urge the authorities to focus on high-risk groups when designing health programs, as vulnerable populations are always disproportionately affected during disease outbreaks.Doctors say the poliovirus mainly affects children and is usually transmitted through droplets or aerosols from the throat and by faecal contamination of hands, utensils, food and water. Those who do not wash their hands properly, and those who consume contaminated food and water or reside in an area where water and sanitation conditions are poor are at high risk of getting infected with the virus.Experts urge health authorities to carry out post-campaign surveys to know the actual coverage of the campaign.“Achieving 104 percent coverage is more of an administrative number,” said Upreti, former director general, who is also a child health expert. “Health authorities must carry out a post-campaign survey to reveal the true picture.”Regular immunisation is one of the most successful programmes in Nepal, boasting a high coverage rate. The country has made remarkable progress in reducing the under-five mortality rate and the regular immunisation programmes are credited with this achievement. \nAt least three diarrheal patients— one from Kalimati in Kathmandu Metropolitan City, one from Tokha Municipality, and another from Gwarko of Lalitpur district—have tested positive for cholera. Officials at the Health Office Kathmandu said that the National Public Health Laboratory, which carried out testing on stool samples of diarrheal patients, confirmed cholera infection on Monday evening.“Reports from the laboratory confirmed cholera outbreaks in additional three places in the Valley, including two areas in Kathmandu,” said Dr Arjun Sapkota, chief of Health Office Kathmandu. “Earlier rapid diagnostic tests too had shown cholera infection in those patients.” With these additional cases, the total number of diarrheal patients testing positive for cholera across the country has reached 16 within a week. Last week, cholera outbreaks were reported in Godawari Municipality of Lalitpur district and Dhangadhi Sub-metropolitan City of Kailali district.At least 13 people—seven in Godawari Municipality and six in Dhangadhi Sub-metropolis tested positive for cholera, according to officials at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division.Cholera is a highly infectious disease that causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting, which in turn results in dehydration and can lead to death within a few hours if left untreated. The World Health Organisation says cholera is a global threat to public health and an indicator of inequality and a lack of social development.Health officials said that the Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool sample of an infected patient. Health officials concede that the outbreak of the deadly disease in several places at once shows that the cholera has spread to multiple locations of the Valley.According to Officials at the Health Office Kathmandu, the infected patients have been admitted at the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital and Chabahil-based Helping Hands Community Hospital. Following news of the suspected cholera outbreak, the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, along with Health Office Kathmandu and the local units, which are responsible for responding to the disease outbreaks, scrambled to contain the spread of the infection.“Contaminated water is the main culprit behind the cholera outbreaks in Lalitpur and Kailali,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director at the division. “Various programmes including water and sanitation initiatives, and awareness campaigns, are being organised in the affected areas.”The Kathmandu Valley often witnesses cholera outbreaks during the monsoon season, with hundreds of people suffering from diarrheal infections that continue for months. Public health experts say that due to poor sanitation and hygiene conditions, the country as a whole is highly vulnerable to water-borne illnesses including diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid, hepatitis, and cholera, with thousands of people getting infected every year.This year too, major hospitals in Kathmandu Valley have been grappling with a surge in cases of water-borne diseases including severe diarrhoea. “Fifteen to 20 diarrheal patients have been seeking care in our emergency department every day,” said Dr Ravi Shakya, director at the Patan Hospital. In 2022, a total of 77 cases of cholera were confirmed in the Valley. Last year, health authorities administered an oral cholera vaccine in wards 11, 12, and 13 of the Kathmandu Metropolitan City, which were highly affected by the outbreak. Public health experts said that sheer negligence from parts of authorities concerned is responsible for ongoing outbreak of diarrheal disease including deadly cholera. Health authorities in most local units had stopped testing of drinking water just before the start of the monsoon season citing lack of funds, although deadly microbes such as faecal coliform and E coli were frequently detected in drinking water samples.Faecal coliform and E coli, both microscopic organisms, are found in human faeces. According to doctors, their presence of faecal coliform and E coli in drinking water means it is contaminated with sewage.“Ensuring water quality is a regular job and basic duty of the relevant agency,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of Clinical Research Unit at the Sukraraj Hospital. “Such essential services should not be halted under any conditions.”Doctors say bottled water is widely used by households and offices in Kathmandu Valley and is generally considered safe, but water quality of several companies have been found questionable. Presence of dangerous microbes in bottled water every year, which means not all jar water brands are safe to drink without treatment.Doctors have asked authorities to launch awareness drives against water-borne diseases and ensure safe drinking water to prevent deaths from illnesses like cholera.A combination of careful surveys, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation, and treatment is required to contain the spread of the infection, according to doctors.The World Health Organisation also said that a multifaceted approach is key to controlling cholera and reducing deaths. \nOver the decade, Nepali doctors, categorised as “foreign national residents” in India’s prestigious All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), have been deprived of stipends.On June 26, Dr Indra Shekhar Prasad, the president of the Resident Doctors Association (RDA), and Raghunandan Dixit, general secretary of the RDA, wrote to the director of AIIMS and raised the issue of non-payment of stipends to the foreign national residents at AIIMS.“This long-standing grievance demands immediate redressal and your decisive intervention,” the letter said. “The RDA has tirelessly advocated for the rights of these residents, who contribute to AIIMS's mission despite facing this glaring injustice.”Most of the foreign students are from Nepal. Ekata Vyas, who campaigns on behalf of the Nepali students—estimated to number at least 60—told the Post that she is hoping for positive results this time. She has received positive feedback and responses from New Delhi and the Indian Embassy in Kathmandu. The monthly stipend ranges from IRs 90,000 to 1,20,000.Besides taking up the matter, the foreign national doctors, mostly from Nepal, took up the issue before 2011. According to the Nepali doctors who are serving in AIIMS, a case was filed in the Delhi High Court against the discriminatory provision over the stipends and arrears in 2011. The Delhi Court gave its verdict in favour of the students on July 16. In 2013, however, the AIIMS filed a counter case which was made absolute on December 4, 2017, after 27 hearings, most of them just formalities marked by absences on the bench and of defendants. A Nepali student said that since they did not have the time and resources to follow up on the case in court, it was dismissed. “Then, we started discussing the matter with government officials and diplomats,” said the student.During the Nepal visit of Indian prime minister Narendra Modi in 2018, then-prime minister KP Sharma Oli also took up the matter with the Indian delegation.“Then we came to know that the India prime minister's office directed the Ministry of External Affairs to look into the matter and expedite its resolution. The Indian Embassy in Kathmandu also confirmed to India’s Ministry of External Affairs that Indian students in similar courses are getting stipends equal to their Nepali counterparts from their respective institutions in Nepal. In May 2018, India’s Ministry of External Affairs wrote to the Ministry of Health and Family Affairs to examine and expedite the prime minister’s directive.Then, India’s health ministry wrote to AIIMS, the Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (JPIMER), and the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, seeking the details of the foreign national residents.“It is pertinent to note that esteemed institutions such as JIPMER and PGIMER have already rectified similar issues by ensuring stipend payments to their Foreign National Residents as early as 2020. AIIMS, renowned for its commitment to excellence and equity, cannot afford to lag behind in such matters of principle. As representatives of the RDA, we assert that the workload and dedication of Foreign National Residents are equivalent to their peers who receive stipends,” the RDA stated in its letter to the AIIMS director.After two premier health institutions started providing the stipends in April 2020, the Resident Doctors Association of AIIMS wrote to the Prime Minister's Office in India seeking its intervention and solidarity with the foreign national residents who have been deprived of the stipends for the past decade.Again in May of the same year, the AIIMS association wrote to the AIIMS director to recognise the efforts by foreign national residents during the pandemic and consider resuming the stipend, but the request went unheard.In January 2023, the AIIMS issued a public notice stating that the government of Nepal should sponsor these students.Nepal’s foreign ministry then clarified that the Nepali students had competed openly and were selected on merit with no sponsorship or role of the government of Nepal. It directed the Nepali Embassy in New Delhi to look into the matter. “We took up the issue with prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and urged him to raise the matter while meeting with Modi,” said the Nepali doctors. “In September, 2023, the Supreme Court of India issued a verdict in a similar case stating that nonpayment of stipend cannot be justified.”Arguing that it is equivalent to bonded labour, the verdict directed the Medical Council to take note of instances in which the stipend is not paid.The Indian government informed the Supreme Court of India that, as per its directive, action will be taken to ensure that there is parity in medical education. “We again wrote to the foreign minister of Nepal, the Nepali Embassy, and the Indian Embassy to discuss the matter during the bilateral commission meeting scheduled for the first week of January 2024,” a Nepali doctor said.Both foreign minister NP Saud and Nepal’s ambassador Shankar Sharma took up the matter during the seventh joint commission meeting held in Kathmandu, according to the students.Then, several meetings were held, correspondence was made by the resident doctors of AIIMS, and Nepali students submitted applications to the health minister of India, people informed on the matter said.\"RDA asserts that the workload and dedication of foreign national residents are equivalent to their peers who receive stipends,\" said RDA President Dr Inder Shekhar Prasad. \"Denial of their stipends not only undermines their morale but also tarnishes AIIMS's reputation as a beacon of medical education and equality.\"The Nepali doctors said that since India has come up with a new budget, they hope their long struggle for getting stipends will be resolved. \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result.

Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar. \nThe noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built. Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nNepal national women’s volleyball team suffered their first defeat of the 2024 CAVA Women’s Volleyball Nations League as they lost to a resilient Iran 2-3 at the National Sports Council’s covered hall in Kathmandu on Sunday.Nepal were already assured a place in the semi-finals after Sri Lanka defeated the Maldives in straight sets of 25-22, 25-12, 25-12 earlier in the day.Aruna Shahi’s team also arrived in the evening match brimming with confidence following their historic first ever victory over India.But they were so reckless that they soon found themselves 16-10 behind and by the time they started caution it was already too late. Nepal could not recover and lost the set 25-16, which would cost them dearly.Nepal started the second set strongly and took a 7-0 lead and got back in the game with a dominating 25-16 victory.The hosts were also bright in the third set controlling the game 7-2 but Iran showed a remarkable recovery to level the set 9-9 before winning the competitive contest 25-23.Nepal gathered themselves up in the fourth set and pushed the contest to a deciding fifth set with a comfortable 25-15 win.But Iran floored Nepal with a calm performance and a disciplined defence, winning the fifth set 15-13.The victory gave Iran seven points from four games.Nepal have six points and a match in hand. They play the Maldives, who have already exited the competition after a three-match winless run, on Monday.India have seven points and play Sri Lanka, on four points, in their last league game, also on Monday. \nNepal's national women's volleyball team defeats India for the first time in their history, putting them in contention for a semi-final spot in the CAVA Women's Volleyball Nations League.\nBangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled the country on Monday after hundreds of people were killed in a crackdown on demonstrations that began as protests against job quotas and swelled into a movement demanding her downfall.Jubilant, cheering crowds stormed into the opulent grounds of the presidential residence unopposed, carrying out looted furniture and TVs. One man balanced a red velvet, gilt-edged chair on his head. Another held an armful of vases.Elsewhere in Dhaka, protesters climbed atop a statue of Hasina's father, state founder Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, and began chiselling away at the head with an axe.The flight into exile ended a 15-year second stint in power for Hasina, who has ruled for 20 of the last 30 years as leader of the political movement inherited from her father, assassinated with most of his family in a 1975 coup.Army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman announced Hasina's resignation in a televised address to the nation and said an interim government would be formed. He called for peace and promised justice for those killed in weeks of unrest.He said he had held talks with leaders of major political parties - excluding Hasina's long-ruling Awami League - and would soon meet President Mohammed Shahabuddin to discuss the way ahead.India's ANI news agency said Hasina, 76, landed at a military airfield near Delhi. Reuters could not immediately verify this, but commercial tracking services showed a Bangladesh Air Force plane leaving the country and flying west before it disappeared.“The country is going through a revolutionary period,” said Zaman, 58, who had taken over as army chief only on June 23.“I promise you all, we will bring justice to all the murders and injustice. We request you to have faith in the army of the country. I take full responsibility and I assure you to not get disheartened,” he said. “I request you all to be a little patient, give us some time and together we will be able to solve all the problems,” Zaman added. “Please don't go back to the path of violence and please return to non-violent and peaceful ways.”Bangladesh has been engulfed by violence since student protests last month against the quotas, which reserve some public sector jobs for veterans of Bangladesh's 1971 independence war, seen as favouring allies of the ruling party.The protests escalated into a campaign demanding the overthrow of Hasina, and were met by a violent crackdown in which about 250 people have been killed and thousands injured.She had won a fourth straight term only in January this year in an election boycotted by the main opposition party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party of her nemesis Begum Khaleda Zia.Hasina had ruled since winning a decades-long power struggle with Zia in 2009. The two women each inherited political movements from slain rulers - in Hasina's case, from her father Mujib; in Zia's case, from her husband Ziaur Rahman, who took power after Mujib's death and was himself assassinated in 1981.“Hasina’s resignation proves the power of the people,” said Tarique Rahman, the exiled eldest son of the two Zias who now serves as acting chairman of the opposition party.“Together, let’s rebuild Bangladesh into a democratic and developed nation, where the rights and freedoms of all people are protected,” he posted on X.WEEKS OF PROTESTS, VIOLENCEStudent activists had called for a march to the capital Dhaka on Monday in defiance of a nationwide curfew to press Hasina to resign after clashes across the country on Sunday killed nearly 100 people.On Monday, at least six people were killed in clashes between police and protesters in the Jatrabari and Dhaka Medical College areas, the Daily Star newspaper reported. Reuters could not verify the report.Sunday's death toll, which included at least 13 policemen, was the highest for a single day from any protests in Bangladesh's recent history, surpassing the 67 deaths reported on July 19 when students took to the streets against the quotas.Last month, at least 150 people were killed and thousands injured in violence touched off by student groups protesting against the job quotas.The government declared the indefinite nationwide curfew starting at 6 pm. (1200 GMT) on Sunday and also announced a three-day general holiday starting from Monday.Over the weekend, there have been attacks, vandalism and arson targeting government buildings, offices of Hasina's Awami League party, police stations and houses of public representatives, local media reported. Bangladesh Railway said it had suspended all services indefinitely due to the escalating violence. Garment factories in the country, which supply apparel to some of world's top brands, have also been closed indefinitely.The role of the country's army in tackling the violence had come into focus with a group of retired military officers urging Hasina to withdraw troops from the streets and undertake “political initiatives” to resolve the crisis.Critics of Hasina, along with human rights groups, have accused her government of using excessive force against protesters, a charge she and her ministers deny.Hasina had said that “those who are carrying out violence are not students but terrorists who are out to destabilise the nation”. \nJuddha Shumsher Rana founded the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden in 1932, featuring a diverse collection of animals including elephants, tigers, rhinoceroses, monkeys, birds, and even lions, and serving as both an entertainment venue and a private sanctuary for the prime minister.\nNepali book market is flooded with unauthorized translations of international bestsellers, violating copyright laws, harming authors, and diminishing the quality of literature available to Nepali readers.\nBharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality’s ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via ‘tallo bato’—backdoor route—and that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal. \nNepal's recent Monetary Policy, praised for its expansionary measures, has led to a 4.4% surge in the stock market, particularly due to the removal of margin-loan cap for institutional investors, raising concerns about excessive leverage and the potential for speculative mania.\nThe Annual Kathmandu Conference on Nepal and the Himalaya, organized by Social Science Baha, showcased diverse research presentations from scholars on themes related to Nepal, the Himalayas, and society.\nThe prime minister and several ministers keep on asking: Since the quota reform has already been implemented, why are the students still demonstrating? The repetition of this question only proves how blind to facts and disconnected with the people the government and Awami League leaders are. They are denying or seem to be oblivious to the fact that over 200 killed—the government itself admits to 150—and thousands injured by the indiscriminate firing by the police and Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) has totally changed the situation. In one eye hospital in Dhaka, during the violence, nearly 400 people who sustained eye injuries were treated, 300 of whom had to be admitted, and 250 had to undergo eye surgery. The majority of them had pellet (a particular type of ammunition used by police during the recent violence) wounds in one or both eyes. Imagine what the total figure could be like. We have no count yet of how many will have to amputate one or both arms or legs due to gunshots, and how many more will have to be operated upon. How many will really return to normal life? Everything points to mindless violence that cannot be termed as police action to quell unrest that emanates from usual demonstrations in our part of the world. The evidence is of a mindset of \"shoot at sight,\" as announced by an AL leader.Today's issue is seeking justice. Justice for the massacre of students and other citizens, the unleashing of a killing machine that the police and BGB turned out to be, the large-scale arrests, the \"block raids,\" the house-to-house search, the false cases, and the insults of terming the demonstrators in general to be agents of destruction and anti-Bangladesh forces.The all-encompassing issue that has alienated the students and enraged the people is the atmosphere of fear under which all students, youth, politically involved citizens, and people in general are having to live. (A father called this author and said, \"I have a school-going son. I become tense with every sound of a car stopping near my house at night\".) The killings definitely stand as the most brutal retaliation by a government on any civic movement in the post-liberation Bangladesh history—and may be that of the subcontinent. We shudder at the thought of how a civilian government could allow its law enforcers to attack its own people with such brutality. The killing was not just an event, but one that took place over several days. Wasn't there any reflection, any afterthought and reassessment at the end of the first, second or third day that such heartless and continuous killing of one's own people must stop?What brought the party that led us during the Liberation War to this? Over 15 years of unaccountable power, greed, cronyism, wealth accumulation, abuse of authority, and the attitude that they are above the law.Of all the deaths, the most heart-rending is perhaps the story of Riya Gope, a six-year-old in Nayamati, Narayanganj, who was playing on the rooftop of their four-storey building. On July 19 afternoon, when police started firing on the demonstrators on the street near her house, her father Dipak Kumar Gope rushed to the roof to get her; he was carrying his daughter back to their flat when a bullet struck the child's head. She died at the Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH) on July 25. How could a bullet hit someone on the roof of a four-storey building unless the police took an aim to do so? Was Riya a threat? The explanation will most likely be that it was an accident. But can that be acceptable when she was in her father's arms on the roof of a four-storey building?Use of helicopters to fire sound grenades and tear gas shells is a new element we saw in crowd-handling by the law enforcers this time around. However, there are disturbing accounts from the public, reporters and especially photographers that rifle shots were fired from these helicopters upon demonstrating crowds. On July 18 and 19, around mid-morning, helicopters hovered over Mayor Hanif Flyover, Shanir Akhra, Kajla and Signboard areas, sometimes sweeping down as they flew and fired on the crowd gathered below. These helicopters were clearly marked with the insignia of our law enforcers.The case of Sumaiya Akter in Narayanganj adds credibility to this claim. She was 20 years old and the mother of a healthy two-month-old daughter. Hearing the sound of the helicopter and that of the clashes going on outside, following her mother, Sumaiya ventured out to the veranda of her sixth floor apartment to see what was going on. She got hit by a live bullet and died soon after. Where could the bullet come from? Given the height and the location of the apartment, the most likely possibility is that the shot came from a helicopter, as claimed by her family. This gives substance to claims by many others that they saw gunshots coming from helicopters.How can a protesting crowd be fired upon from the air by their own government? Firing from helicopters is known to occur only when operating in an \"enemy\" territory or a location captured by armed terrorists. How can our own BGB or Rab or police fire upon our own people in such a manner?We demand a credible and thorough investigation on the use of helicopters and their firing on demonstrators. While the judicial investigation to probe all deaths should continue, a separate and fast-track probe must be conducted to reveal the truth on this specific matter.It must also be investigated as to what led to such a large-scale killing in the hands of law enforcers. Who made the threat assessment, and how? At what stage were they allowed to open fire on demonstrators, and who gave the orders to shoot? The rifles used were all modern and sophisticated. BGB used weapons meant to protect our borders. How could they be allowed to tackle student demonstrators with the same weapons? The investigation should also consider whether or not excessive force and disproportionate firepower were used against the demonstrators, none of whom have so far been seen to carry firearms. They were all carrying sticks and iron rods.It is our considered view that the government and the ruling party continue to live in their own bubble and underestimate the depth of the people's grievances that has resulted from the killings of students and the public. We also feel that peace will not return to the campuses and the streets until justice is done and convincingly seen to be done. Force can be used to \"calm\" the situation, but it will be temporary. The lengthier the period of uncertainty, the more grievous will be its impact on our economy and the country's international acceptability.Those who are used to using power to get their way are usually not aware of its limits. We have used Ansar, police, Rab, BGB and even the army, and an extreme measure like curfew. What has been the result? Yes, brutality, death, arrests and harassment can be further ratcheted up. But all that will generate more resentment, deeper hatred, and critical desperation. Such use of force may, at best, show a superficial show of calm, but will never solve our real problem of \"power corrupting and absolute power corrupting absolutely\" (adopting Lord Acton's time-honoured observation).We urge the government to no longer hide behind convenient narratives that stand totally contradicted by facts. We further urge them to examine the brutality with which the demonstrators have been treated and the death and injuries that ordinary students and the people have had to suffer, and respond to the call for justice. We also urge them to stop befooling themselves as facts are in people's hands due to modern technology. Yes, there could be a lot of false news and videos in the digital sphere. But there are many credible ones too. Wisdom should compel the government not to brush them aside, which it will do only at its own peril.-The Daily Star (Bangladesh)/ANN \nTwo swept-away buses in the roaring Trishuli River remain untraced, revealing insufficient disaster preparedness, necessitating heightened vigilance, skilled rescuers, and community-level mobilization.\nNepal's Parliamentary Hearing Committee rejected the appointment of Krishna Man Pradhan as election commissioner due to sexual exploitation allegations, highlighting the importance of the committee's scrutiny despite the Constitutional Council's recommendation.\nNepali students are flocking to Japan for higher education due to its affordability and work-study options, but the nation should focus on building a global network of Nepalis and fostering collaboration to harness their potential.\nAjaya Dixit’s current work focuses on studying challenges of building resilience across boundaries and at sub-national scales. He has studied and written extensively on water resources, trans-boundary water cooperation, flood management, wash services and climate change adaptation, clean energy transition and related policy studies. In this interview with the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal, Dixit discusses river management in Nepal’s urban areas: Where have we gone wrong in this endeavour and what can we do? You have extensively studied river systems and have been following changes seen in river basins. How do you see recent problems caused by encroachment and rampant development activities?We humans have lived and have to continue to live within water cycles: water evaporates from the ocean to the sky and then precipitates to the land and flows via rivers back to the ocean. Rivers that function as arteries of the land surface, sustaining humans, aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems face widespread abuses: pollution, rampant extraction of their bed and banks, fragmentation and degradation. Without rivers, we would not be who we are. Unfortunately, we have forgotten this essence. We neglect and abuse rivers. In 1981, just after the monsoon ended, I, along with my students, walked from Sundarijal to Teku studying Bagmati rivers’ sediment. At many places, we walked on the riverbed. The river then was clean. Gradually, the river systems began to face all-round decay. I have read painful accounts of my contemporaries who remember swimming in the clean Bagmati and its tributaries. In less than 50 years, our rivers in Kathmandu Valley and other basins no longer look like rivers. I feel helpless and ache with pain at this collective failure! What state of rivers are we passing on to our next generation?River encroachment is common across Nepal but more serious in urban areas, including in Kathmandu. How can this be stopped?Our approach to rivers is an imitation of the trend common across South Asia, or the subcontinent, which is again largely based on the knowledge system developed in the industrialised Global North without contextualising locally. The region features waterscapes of high and punctuated rainfall during the monsoon months, rivers, wetlands, ponds, and springs, all connected with groundwater aquifers in one of the most complex landscapes of the world: the Himalaya-Ganga region. Yet, current development endeavours subjugate water rather than respect and live with it. In 2022, the Indus River in Pakistan faced major floods with devastating consequences. Referring to these floods, a group of global scientists stated that “the impacts [of the floods] were the outcome of an outdated river management system.” This approach is primarily based on building of physical structures such as buildings, bridges and roads close to rivers interfering with their natural flows. The approach that began in the early twentieth century keeps marching on even while we are facing twenty first century water challenges.There is an increasing trend of building corridor roads along the rivers in Kathmandu as well as other places. Is this a good or bad practice? In Nepal, road building in the hills has earned the sobriquet of “dozer roads,” meaning politically designed roads excavated by heavy machine operators without adhering to basic engineering, social, environmental, or hydrological safeguards. Even highways built with “engineering,” such as the Mugling-Narayanghat section, face regular accidents. The sliding of the two buses in the Trishuli is the recent example. Building roads along the banks of rivers, defined as “river corridors,” is the preferred approach for improving connectivity. In the Kathmandu Valley, this is also associated with rivers shackled within concrete walls in the name of river beautification. In the monsoon, however, they all overflow as we have been seeing in the last few years and this year as well.What will happen to these rivers 10-15 years down the line? Is there any chance of some of our rivers dying? Or, will the measures taken in recent times protect them?All rivers must flow clean and free in selected stretches. But today, rivers are disconnected with their floodplains. Within walls and embankments, they have become conduits of filth. Many rivers are already seriously degraded. If the current trend continues, many rivers may die. I remember Jacques-Yves Cousteau, the French oceanographer, filmmaker, and author, who wrote: “Water and air, the two essential fluids on which all life depends, have become global garbage cans.” Our current efforts at conserving, developing and managing rivers are grossly inadequate. During the Covid-19 pandemic, we saw some rivers heal as human actions across the board ceased due to the lockdown. But this healing came at huge human and economic costs. The lessons, however, are clear. We must stop turning rivers into garbage cans for them to begin to heal. The onus lies on us, our activities, our governance, and the policies we make and put into practice effectively. We need new ways of imagining rivers in harmony with human needs. Otherwise, the rivers will die. If rivers die, what will become of us?What problems may city dwellers face as a result of this continued destruction of rivers?A 2020 analysis of rivers in Nepal found that the quality of rivers in the mid-hills and the Tarai are already deteriorating. Industries, cities, towns, and agriculture produce waste that, when disposed of in rivers untreated, cause pollution. Solid and liquid wastes produced by expanding cities and towns pollute nearby rivers, streams, and water bodies. Pollution kills aquatic life such as fish, which are sources of livelihood for many communities. Polluted rivers and water bodies degrade human and environmental health, leading to negative impacts on human livelihoods. The impacts of pollution on rivers are considerable during non-monsoon months when river discharge, and consequently the capacity of rivers to dilute waste, are low.What should be done to conserve the rivers, at least in the present form, and stop further damages?All rivers are a combination of water (W), energy (E), biodiversity aquatic (B), and sediment (S), represented by the acronym WEBS. In the current scheme of things, the focus is on water and energy. Aquatic ecosystems are the concern of only those working on freshwater ecosystems. They are neglected in the larger context though the state has made some provisions for conserving ecosystems. In Nepal’s Hydropower Development Policy of 2001 all hydropower plants must release 10 percent minimum flow to the downstream reaches to enable fish and other aquatic life to survive in the river. A 2021 study of 50 hydropower plants however found that none of the plants surveyed release environmental-flows. All hydropower plants, as per their power purchasing agreements, are required to produce maximum power during the dry season. We should start by accepting the fact that rivers need clean flowing water and respecting the policies we have made. Then we must systematically introduce changes and avoid the oversights embedded in the present approach. The present approach to water development and management focused on engineering and structural solutions is based on single-disciplinary education that is blind to gender and social inclusion challenges and aquatic ecosystems. In the present approach, nobody seems to want sediment which is a natural consequence of flow within the water cycle.To meet such an objective, we need to begin with a system of integrated knowledge that synthesises natural science, social science, and indigenous practices. By incorporating fields such as hydrology, ecology, social science-supported context-specific engineering, and indigenous knowledge and practices, we can take a comprehensive approach to water management challenges and solutions. Interdisciplinary approaches can build collaboration, innovation, and systemic decision-making and promote innovative water management for the benefit of both ecosystems and human societies.Do you think initiatives such as river clean up campaigns run by various groups help protect these waterways?I see such initiatives as manifestation of dissatisfaction of concerned citizens with the degradation of rivers and to bring about changes. In 1990, I was part of the Save Bagmati Campaign, which aimed to highlight the degrading state of the river. This campaign has taken many new forms, and citizen groups have begun campaigns in other rivers of Nepal. They however remain fragmented and ad-hoc. Similar campaigns in some countries have led to granting rights to rivers. In 2017, New Zealand recognised the Whanganui River and its tributaries as legal entities, acknowledging their physical and spiritual significance as “living and indivisible” and ensuring their survival, health, and integrity to balance the needs of humans and nature. Promulgations like Living Indus (Pakistan), Namami Gange river-improvement programme (India) can offer lessons for a holistic water journey. The collective voice of concerned citizens for the integrity of rivers can be a powerful medium for policy and pathway changes. Nepal must also begin country-wide river restoration initiatives. We need more dialogue and conservation around water challenges and solutions.As cities turn into concrete jungles, their water tables are said to be receding alarmingly. You often propose redesigning our settlements and development infrastructure in a way that wouldn’t disturb rivers’ natural courses and catchment areas. Could you elaborate?South Asia is a region of waterscapes containing streams, ponds, wetlands, open spaces, floodplains, springs, and underground aquifers. Yet, our towns, cities, and infrastructure are planned, designed, and built to disregard water rather than live with it. As land-centric urban growth dominates, waterscapes temporarily seem to vanish but later water comes back. In Nepali we have a saying “In twelve years a stream returns”. The present practice of urban development is obsessed with concretisation, making these areas impermeable. Rainwater, part of which would naturally infiltrate the ground, now immediately reaches the rivers already constrained by walls. The river at a downstream section immediately peaks and when the rainfall stops the river has very low discharge. Basic parameters, like the intensity of rainfall (mm per hour), are poorly recognised and used in design guidelines. The interaction of current urbanisation practices and increasing extreme rainfall, temperature and humidity rise spawned by climate change and urban heat island effects will make our urban areas as crucible of hazards, and unhealthy. A new urban future must harmoniously integrate nature, including water bodies and wetlands, and preserve natural land cover, including traditional ponds to promote groundwater recharge. It can be further achieved by preserving green open spaces, forests, gardens, permeable “sponge” pavements, and natural waterfronts for healthier communities in sustainable cities. The starting point will be recognising cities as waterscapes. Amplified mitigation of emissions of greenhouse gases at global levels remains a critical imperative in this new future. The major impacts of climate change are evident through the water cycle. Squatters settled along the riverbanks are taken as one of the major headaches in preserving rivers’ catchment areas. How can this issue be resolved?The squatters and migrants to urban regions are outcomes of the present-day political economy of development. People move to cities seeking livelihood, education, and opportunities to move up the social ladder. These groups who end up living in high-risk areas are sometimes also seen as political vote banks. This issue needs to be viewed within the larger development question including generation of local employment, new livelihood opportunities and addressing insecurities of water, food, health, and education.Recently the Supreme Court asked authorities to make septic tank and soak pit mandatory while approving building designs in order to help recharge groundwater, and a recent Cabinet meeting has banned building any structure within 40 metres on both sides of major rivers in Kathmandu, Do such measures help keep the rivers alive or is that too little too late?Such decisions, in some way, seem to underscore the notion of giving space to rivers and maintaining their integrity. Building of septic tanks as part and parcel of new houses began in the 1970s as primary treatment units that can prevent the direct dumping of human waste into rivers and water bodies. The regular cleaning and safe disposal of waste from septic tanks are emerging questions. Rivers and waterscapes face much deeper challenges, however. The present water development model marches on like a mighty tusker, trampling in its path communities, villagers, residents, natural ecosystems, the terrestrial and aquatic beings, and past memories. Turning that around will require those working on water and river integrity across geographical, social, disciplinary and political boundaries to join hands in seeking changes and laying the foundation for a new ethical social contract for rivers and waterscapes as a first step in that long journey. \nWithin days of CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli and Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba reaching a deal to form a new government under Oli’s leadership, some Congress leaders including the two party general secretaries started doubting the deal’s implementation. Independent observers also have doubts over the longevity of the Congress-UML partnership. To get some insight, the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Congress Central Committee member Govind Raj Pokharel, who is also former vice-chair of National Planning Commission. Many have expressed doubt over the longevity of the Congress-UML alliance. What is your observation?There was a discussion in the political circles on the need for the Congress and the UML joining hands to address some serious problems the country has been facing for years. The issues of governance, flaws seen in the practice of the electoral system, and the national economy are some pressing issues that need to be addressed. In the meantime, the top leaders of the two largest parties reached a deal overnight. The dramatic turn of events made people suspect some unspoken reasons had brought the leaders of the two rival forces together. The leaders have stated that they joined hands mainly to review the constitution, to make changes in the electoral system, improve governance and address problems seen in the economic sector. These are the stated objectives. As far as my observation goes, people don’t have full faith in the leaders of the two parties because of past records. On the economic front, this coalition may achieve some improvements because both parties are on the same page. Both follow liberal economic ideas. Of late, even the UML has become increasingly liberal on economic issues. The private sector has welcomed the new alliance. There are already some signs of reforms. Their plan to make changes in the electoral system through constitutional amendment however is not easy. First, their numerical strength in the federal parliament, mainly in the upper house, is insufficient to amend the constitution. Such a move would be risky from a strategic perspective as well. Many groups and forces have reservations over various provisions of this constitution. Once they start the amendment process, it will be like opening Pandora’s Box. Thus I am optimistic only on the economic front. If they get that right, it will help address the society’s mass frustration.The two parties have cited the perennial political instability as a major reason behind their coming together. Can we now expect policy consistency as well?Political instability is an excuse to cover up their failures. Even the alliance of largest parties cannot guarantee political or policy stability. Numbers alone are not enough. Leaders also need to have a democratic culture and the capacity to manage emerging issues. Even governments led by a single party commanding up to two-thirds majority have failed. On certain occasions, coalition governments have done commendable jobs. Handling the post-quake situation and producing the constitution in 2015 were examples of big parties justifying their coalition. Thus even with some doubt, we can expect political stability and some economic reforms.The Congress unanimously endorsed the deal of party president Sher Bahadur Deuba and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli. But in public, leaders from the anti-establishment faction of the Congress don’t seem satisfied. Why this unease?The deal was made in a dramatic way without proper consultations with other leaders. At least those in the executive committees of the party should have been consulted. It is challenging for the Congress leaders to ally with their major rival, the UML. A cadre-based party, the UML’s style of governance is different to that of the Congress. When in government, the UML treats even government institutions, constitutional bodies and independent agencies as the party’s structures. Whereas the Congress allows more freedom to government agencies. So, there is a risk of the UML misusing state mechanisms while the Congress leaders are in the Cabinet. This is one big risk for the Congress. The second concern is the working style of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli. He is a towering personality, a hard-working leader, and with his strong command over his party organisation, he can swiftly implement any proposal. The Congress ministers who also have to listen to the concerns of the party’s top leaders may struggle to strike a balance. In Oli’s Cabinet, ministers are likely to get less freedom within their ministries. A rift is thus likely because of Prime Minister Oli’s working style.Why didn’t the Congress then send influential leaders to the Cabinet to check the prime minister?The leaders might not have been so interested in joining this government. They might have sensed intervention from the prime minister’s office and thought they might not be able to perform as per their expectation under Oli’s leadership. See, chiefs of the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre work in a dictatorial way. Once they are elected at the party convention for four years, they behave like dictators. They take decisions on their own without any consultations. People in Nepal often lobby for a directly-elected prime minister or President. I wonder what these leaders would do if they were directly elected as executive head. So, the problem is in the working style and attitude of our leaders, not in the constitution or the electoral system.Shekhar Koirala and Gagan Thapa had first pitched for joining hands with the UML to end ‘unnecessary bargaining’ of fringe parties. Suddenly, Deuba struck the deal with Oli. And, now Koirala and Thapa seem sceptical about the deal.The proposal of Koirala and Thapa was for Congress leading the government and the UML supporting it. In fact, Oli was ready to accept Congress leadership. He requested the Congress leaders to take the lead. Surprisingly, the negotiating team led by our party president reached an opposite deal. They offered government leadership to Oli.Then, could it be that, as some claim, Deuba and his wife Arzu were desperate to unseat Dahal fearing they could be dragged into corruption scams?I don’t know much about that scenario. But what I knew is that Oli was willing to join a Congress-led government.Why would Deuba, who is a very clever leader in making such give-and-take deals, have given up a chance to be prime minister right away?It’s true that all three party chiefs—Deuba, Oli and Dahal—are very clever in making deals in their own favour based on their numerical strength. A leader beats the other two on one occasion and on another, another of them comes out on top. It’s like a see-saw. This time Oli won the game.Congress General Secretaries Gagan Thapa and Bishwa Prakash Sharma have expressed suspicion over the implementation of the deal. Many say they did so as Deuba didn’t involve them in negotiations on power-sharing. Is it true?The party’s central work execution committee endorsed the deal signed by the two leaders. The leaders who participate in such meetings should speak up then and there if there is anything objectionable, instead of making such statements in public. Why didn’t they oppose it at the meeting? I don’t see any point in expressing doubt over the deal in public while endorsing the same in party committees.The two general secretaries also expressed doubt over Oli handing over government leadership to Deuba as per the agreement. Why this mistrust?The experience of the past two or three decades makes politicians suspicious of each other. Nepali politicians have hardly ever handed over government leadership easily. After four or five months of collaboration, some issues emerge and a rift is created. So, history makes us doubt that this coalition will last for three and half years. In the meantime, the party establishments have sidelined other factions when it comes to picking ministers, both at federal and provincial levels. When the government fails to perform as per expectation, party cadres of the ruling parties start criticising the government. Is it possible to amend the constitution as the two parties have announced?We can’t backtrack on the inclusive system. We must abide by the policy of inclusion in state agencies. The leaders who spoiled this system are saying that the proportional representation (PR) system is not working. But there is room to make our three-tier federal system more cost-effective. People get irritated when they see a large number of representatives benefitting from state coffers. We can bring down the number of local units from 753 to around 400. However, there should be sufficient wards as those units are directly involved in service delivery while the Palikas are more engaged in development activities. The number of ward members can also be decreased. In provinces, we don’t need PR seats as those elected from the provincial constituencies automatically represent the local communities. Likewise, the provincial cabinets can be downsized. Thus we can downsize the number of people who benefit from state coffers. This is vital to make the federal system sustainable. Similarly, we can rightsize the number of PR seats by adopting a rotational constituency for women, dalits and other marginalised communities. Only the candidates from underrepresented sections will compete in those constituencies. This will help elect competent people even from within the targeted communities. This is how we can address some concerns without compromising the inclusive system envisioned in the constitution.Why has the Congress picked gangsters and tainted individuals as ministers in provinces?The selection of such controversial individuals as ministers and policy makers will damage the party’s image. People are going to raise this issue seriously. In fact the pace of criminalisation and commercialisation of Nepali politics is faster than the political reform being undertaken to clean up politics.It seems intellectual leaders are being sidelined while gangsters are being promoted. Why is it happening?Because people from intellectual or political backgrounds voice critical views and leaders don’t like it. They speak what their conscience says is right. For instance, leaders like Mahesh Acharya and Minendra Rijal aren’t given any role in the party. It is a common problem in all the major political forces in Nepal.Is the space for leaders with intellectual backgrounds and having critical views being squeezed?The Congress used to be a very liberal organisation. But it has also become illiberal and leaders have become increasingly intolerant. All leaders—whether the seniors or young ones—are becoming less tolerant even of constructive criticism. Party leaders haven’t spoken against the selection of gangsters as ministers. Even the office bearers who are in decision making bodies and can change the decisions are silent now. This is dangerous. This is an example of how critical voices are sidelined.Haven’t the two young general secretaries been able to raise hope in the Congress?They are working like central committee members. General secretaries should be able to intervene while making crucial policy decisions. They can stop the party committees from making wrong decisions. But they are risk-averse. They are not taking the risk to fight the powerful party establishment.Historically, in all parties there is a trend of its anti-establishment faction bargaining for 40-45 percent seats in the party or government. If they don’t get an acceptable power sharing deal, they don’t cooperate with the party leadership. Is it a healthy democratic practice?Intra-party competition compels the leaders to do this. The ruthless establishment always sidelines party members and leaders if they aren’t loyal. So, the leadership of the anti-establishment has to protect such cadres because the rival factor too needs a strong support base of cadres to compete against the powerful establishment. Party establishments are strong due to centralised resources and other factors, so you need an equally strong force to compete against them. \nScores of people have been killed in landslides, floods and other monsoon-induced disasters within a month of the monsoon entering Nepal in the second week of June. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asks Jagadishwor Karmacharya, director general of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, what the department is doing to save people from disasters and whether our system is ready to cope with the challenges posed by climate change.Where is Nepal in terms of technology and expertise when it comes to forecasting the ever-changing weather patterns?If we compare to our situation a decade ago, we have made significant progress in setting up meteorological stations, collecting real-time data and increasing the frequency of weather predictions. We get rainfall data from around 350 stations, while we receive information about temperature and other related parameters from around 150 stations. We have an additional 175 centres to collect information about water levels. Our servers get real-time data every 10 minutes from all these stations. Besides that, we also have manual data collection centres. Thus, we have around 800 data collection centres in total. But we haven’t been able to set up enough stations in the Himalayan range due to difficult topography, low presence of government agencies and other factors. Also, we release radiosonde balloons to collect data on temperature, humidity and wind speed from the upper levels of the atmosphere. Overall, we have made huge strides in using technologies in the past decade, but it is still insufficient to cater to people’s expectations. They want specific weather information about their present location or destination. The expectation is valid. But our complex and diverse topography and meteorological phenomenon—ranging from the Tarai belt to the Himalayan range—makes accurate forecasts challenging. Kaski’s Lumle sees maximum rainfall in the country, and around 40 km north of it, the Jomsom area sees negligible rain. So great variability within a short distance adds to the challenge of forecasting.Do we have sufficient stations to cater to that variability?We need more stations because the higher you go, the more variabilities you find. In the plains, the weather pattern is more homogenous, while it is highly heterogeneous in the hills. In Tarai, even a station in around 100-150 kilometres may work because there is less variability of temperature as well as rainfall. But we need more stations in the hills where rain patterns drastically change.Are our methods and technologies being updated over time?Until around a decade ago, the forecasters used to predict based on their experience and the data received every three hours from the synoptic weather stations of Nepal and other neighbouring countries. At the time, we used to predict weather only for a day. Now, we synthesise the data collected from our systems and those from the modelling centres from India, China and other countries. Now, we can forecast for three days.Our capacity has significantly increased mainly in observing real time happenings. As I said, we take updates from hundreds of stations every 10 minutes. We also take satellite pictures from 16 channels of Japan’s Himawari Satellite, which has stationed its receiver in Nepal as well, also every 10 minutes. Until over a decade ago, we used to receive satellite pictures just once or twice a day. Even those pictures weren’t as good as those we get these days. We used to update surface-related data in three hours and upper air data in 12 hours. Based on that, we made a weather forecast for the next 12 hours. In comparison, we now have a large number of hydrological and meteorological real-time observation stations, the updates from Himawari and other satellites every 10 minutes and we have three radars to gather information. With the help of these technologies, now we can get immediate real-time updates. It helps us analyse the data of past hours and predict possible scenarios of the next six to 12 hours. We inform people accordingly. But we have to work more on the technology to make longer forecasts. Despite these progresses, we are still 15-20 years back in comparison to the technologies used by developed countries. We are behind in research. We need more expertise and an upgrade of our technology. Nepal doesn’t have its own satellite. Is this problematic?On the weather observation part, our work has not been hampered because we get data from the satellites of India, China and Japan. On the communication part, we are getting support from telecom companies—NTC and NCell—to transfer data. It covers most parts of the country. Absence of a satellite of our own is less of a concern compared to our other needs.Climate change has brought about massive changes in weather patterns. Do we have sufficient expertise to cope with this?The organisational structure and positions in our department haven’t changed much in over three decades. Demand for our work has drastically increased in the past two decades but we haven’t been able to cater to the demand. We need engineers capable of working with the latest technologies but we don’t have positions for such professionals in our current structure. We have procured some technologies and got some from our donors. But we don’t even have experts to use that as well.As you said, the department has made progress in the past decade but in this period climate change has progressed even faster. How do we keep up with this change?We face new challenges almost every year. In the past couple of years, mountain districts such as Manang and Mustang have not only witnessed rainfalls but also heavy downpours that even swept away bridges and other structures. Last year, over 30 hydropower projects were badly damaged by floods in eastern Nepal. The floods that wreaked havoc in Melamchi in 2021 were unprecedented. These incidents are evidence that climate change has already started to show unusual patterns and cause damages in this Himalayan range. We will face extreme weather patterns like long droughts and heavy rainfalls.The Dodhara weather station of Kanchanpur recorded 624mm of rainfall in 24 hours earlier this month. This is a new record. Before that, 540mm was the highest rainfall recorded, around two decades ago. Upward shifting of snowline in the mountains and formation of glacial lakes are other indications of the impacts of climate change. Don’t you think it’s already late to restructure government agencies, review policies and even redesign our systems?That is necessary. Devastation in Melamchi is one example that suggests the same. While developing such projects, we have to seriously consider possible impacts of climate change. Even if they analyse the possible scenario, they refer to the data of the past few decades. But things are changing so fast, decisions based on old data might not be useful. So, it is becoming more challenging to make projections. Design guidelines definitely need to be updated. Our division lacks policies, let alone updated ones. Though we are issuing red alerts and carrying out other tasks on scientific grounds, we don’t have a legal basis even to do these things.A large number of people in Nepal die in floods and landslides every year. Can we tweak our forecast system to save more lives?We have succeeded in reducing the deaths by floods in comparison to the loss we used to incur until 8-10 years ago. Earlier, we didn’t have flood alert service. It has been around a decade since we started the dedicated flood service. These days, we send mass SMS to the people of areas where floods may cause damage and for that we collaborate with telecoms—NTC and Ncell. We also work with district authorities and I/NGOs mainly in flood-prone districts to run campaigns and conduct drills. This has been quite effective. We are also taking similar initiatives in collaboration with telecom companies and other agencies to inform people on 13 various hydro-meteorological hazards such as, rains, lightning, winds.Working on floods is comparatively easier as it has certain catchment areas and we can focus on specific areas. So our efforts yield results. But in other incidents we can’t focus on certain areas. In floods, we inform the people hours before the flood so that they can shift to safe places. In the past, the death toll from floods used to be the highest. Now there are more deaths from landslides and lightning. We need to work more to give accurate information on lightning as well. Landslides vulnerability has increased due to extreme weather patterns, the impact of 2015 earthquake and rampant road construction.Why don’t people in Nepal follow and rely on weather forecasts? Is it due to negligence or lack of reliability of the prediction?It might be both. If the forecast doesn’t match reality, they may not follow or rely on us. So we need to improve our accuracy. Secondly, we need to increase awareness. Moreover, the weather isn’t as predictable as it used to be. So, we should keep on working, improving accuracy and making people aware. Many rely on international forecasts but not our own. Is our system less efficient?There are two aspects. One is getting accurate information and the second is user-friendly and attractive visual presentation of data, such as in mobile apps. We lag in the second part. Also, people want specific information about their locality and their intended destination. In the past, we used to give information by dividing the country in major regions such as eastern, central, western parts, tarai and hills. Now we have narrowed it down to each district. We need to work more on research.Have we succeeded in connecting weather forecasts to people’s livelihoods?The United Nations has launched the ‘Early Warning For All’ initiative to ensure that everyone on Earth is protected from hazardous weather, water, or climate events through life-saving early warning systems by the end of 2027. Various stakeholders need to join hands to implement it effectively as it has various components. Our expertise is to give as accurate information as we can. We give inputs but there are other agencies that go to the community level and work with the people.What are the things that need to be done in the changed context?We shouldn’t limit our work to simple forecasting but move to impact-based forecasts. For instance, we issue a seven-day Agromet Advisory Bulletin in collaboration with Nepal Agricultural Research Council which includes a summary on weather, crops, livestock, tables on weather and agrometeorological parameters, current weather information along with weather forecast (outlook). In a similar way, we can work with stakeholders on road transport as well. Then, we can make our forecast impactful, connect the general people and win their trust. But that requires proper policies and laws, updating this department’s organisational structure and enhancing the capacity of our human resource. \nThe July 1 midnight deal between the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, the first and the second largest parties in the federal lower house respectively, turned national politics on its head. Pushpa Kamal Dahal was thrown out as prime minister and KP Oli assumed the country’s leadership. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asked Maoist Centre leader Ram Karki, who has cultivated an image of a rebel within the party, on his reading of the event. How do you see the CPN-UML’s rebuffing of the CPN (Maoist Centre) and formation of a new government with the Nepali Congress?If you see it from the perspective of those who believe in parliamentary democracy, this is wrong. In the system, the largest party is believed to have the public mandate to run the government and the second-biggest to be the main opposition. A weak opposition makes for a weak parliamentary system. The system isn’t an ideal one for us [communists]. The two parties have made a mockery of the system they advocate for. Why didn’t the Maoist party that championed progressive agendas implement them when in government?We should admit that we lost the moral authority to implement and execute those agendas. We could have implemented those ideals by mobilising peasants, working-class groups, and people from oppressed communities, but our grip and connection with them have loosened.Why did the party and the leadership distance itself from the working class?The state has two arms—coercive and persuasive. The Maoists succeeded in using coercive force. But you can’t use this all the time. One has to use persuasive force most of the time. When we joined mainstream politics, we were the leading political force. We were in power. At the time we should have changed our education sector. For that, we should have worked on our curriculum and trained teachers. Our educational system is guided by patriarchal and feudal values. We need to orient people to questioning and following science. The party couldn’t do so. Had we done so, we would now have a critical mass with us. The Maoist leaders lost the moral ground. When you preach lofty ideas, the public won’t listen to you. They instead watch your lifestyle. Earlier, the Congress and the UML leaders, who were outsiders in Kathmandu, got ‘polluted’ when they worked in collusion with the capital’s elites. We, too, got ‘polluted’ by hobnobbing with the two parties. The working class and oppressed communities that had helped the Maoist party fight the state felt betrayed. The leaders and the masses are separated now. The Maoist party was the true leader of the progressive agenda such as inclusion, federalism, secularism and republicanism. These ideas are still valid, but the party failed to honour them. It failed because it lost its strength and disconnected itself from the class it fought for. It tried to become the leader of all people. The oppressed communities felt betrayal, while the other classes didn’t accept the party because of our past. Do you think the Congress and the UML will try to undermine progressive agendas enshrined in the new constitution?They have also sold lofty ideas to the people in the past. A counter-revolution under the two parties’ leadership is not easy. Their rank and file won’t accept it. The Congress, in fact, is not only a political party but a collective where you find radical Hindus as well as hardcore secularists. It stays strong as long as it works as a unified force of various groups. But when it imitates communists and tries to be a rigid cadre-based party, it loses its space and strength. So the Congress can’t lead a counter-revolution against progressive ideas. Counter-revolution is not easy, but the reactionary forces have certainly succeeded in regaining their space.Observers and politicians from rival parties claim that the Maoist Centre is now in an existential crisis. Do you think it can make a comeback?More importantly, the space that used to be occupied by the Maoist party is now left unoccupied.Can’t the UML or other forces make inroads into that space?The UML is a tried and tested force. Even the Maoist Centre is now described as a tested force. How can older forces enter that space? A force mightier than the Maoists can emerge. As a Maoist party member, I still vow to rejuvenate and revive the Maoist Centre. I am trying to convince my fellow comrades to do that. But my voice hasn’t prevailed. I have been presenting my papers in the party’s general conventions. We still have a strong belief that sooner or later, we will prevail because we are raising valid issues.Various leftist groups have at various times tried to create a strong, united left political force in Nepal. Do you think ideas like socialism and communism still attract the youth?Some rebel voices within our parties take some initiatives to raise our collective voice to build pressure on party establishments. But this has been limited to theoretical debates and failed to translate into politics. A theory or philosophy is like an iron plate, while crafting a tool from that iron is politics. We haven’t been able to transform our ideas into political action. If a leader floats a political agenda, the people first study the leader’s integrity. If a leader with a strong moral authority proposes an idea, people trust and follow it. If Gandhi was wearing a suit and telling people to wear handwoven khadi, Indian people wouldn’t have followed him. Similarly, if Mao was using clothes, watches and vehicles from developed countries while preaching for simplicity, Chinese people wouldn’t have followed him.Our people don’t listen to our leaders because they don’t see the leaders walk the talk. Youths are always attracted by adventurism; they are receptive and sensitive to certain incidents. Now, they aren’t following us because they don’t find any adventure and newness in our ideas. If we do some soul searching and correct ourselves, the Maoist Centre still can lead the process to complete the unfinished progressive agendas. Is that possible under the current Maoist leadership that has lost its credibility while staying in power for long? Will the people trust them?People will judge them based on their actions. If the Maoist leaders were more credible, there would be no space for the Congress and UML to come together. Either one or the other force would seek the Maoist party’s support. They wouldn’t have dared to ignore the Maoist party that led progressive issues in the recent past. They were emboldened because of the Maoists’ diminishing influence. Therefore, we have to correct ourselves in practice.You said that the classes and communities the Maoist party used to lead now have no leader. Can new outfits occupy that space?The traditional parties—the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre–don’t have any strategic vision on where they want to see the country in 20 years. The new forces are worse. They hit a ball and wherever it reaches, shift the goalpost there. They carry the goalpost with them. New forces with such visions can’t replace old parties. History shows that Nepal has witnessed political upheavals in a gap of 10-15 years. In the past such tsunamis have changed the political systems. Now we have seen sparks of movements but they are scattered. New forces need an ideological weapon. The Maoists forgot to sharpen their ideological weapon over time by holding ideological debates and upgrading themselves. Another is intra-party democracy. A political party that doesn’t practise intra-party democracy can’t enforce democracy in society.From the perspectives of intra-party democracy, the Maoist Centre is probably the most undemocratic of major political forces. Why?In the Congress, you are free to speak, but you don’t have a say in execution. Communist parties are too centralised. The structure conceptualised around a century ago in the context of wars and other contexts hasn’t been updated. Even new parties are run by the party chiefs imitating the anomalies of traditional forces. A leader is praised if s/he takes immediate decisions, gets them endorsed from the party committees and implements them swiftly. Those who say they have to first discuss the issue in party committees are described as weak. Such a trend is killing intra-party democracy.Do you think the Congress-UML coalition will succeed?A coalition between the parties that don’t even have a common minimum programme is a coalition of opportunists. They don’t have a moral ground either. On ideological grounds, the Congress still cites the late BP Koirala because no other leader of the party has worked on the theoretical front for decades. Such is also the situation with communists. They still cite the theoretical works of the late Pushpa Lal Shrestha. The current alliance is not a principled one, it’s a collaboration between opportunists. So, don’t expect anything better.How do you evaluate the outgoing government?It did nothing for the class it represents. The prime minister’s secretariat might have prepared a list of ‘100 important achievements of the government’. But what is the government’s priority? It failed to even give skills to those going abroad in search of work. They would have found better work had we given them valuable skills. Not only the outgoing one but all the previous governments have failed. The Congress-UML alliance has said it wants to review the constitution and amend the charter when necessary. How do you see this idea?This will be backtracking from the present constitutional roadmap. It is dishonest to create hindrance in implementing the federal system and then suggest the system is a burden. Such moves would give space to those who want to raise questions on republic and secular systems. There is a strong faction that lobbies for Hindutwa in the Nepali Congress. It is no secret that the Congress and the UML were not in favour of republic, secular and federal systems. But later, they rode the popular wave. But they have still not internalised it, and there are some regressive elements in both the parties but the people, who have come too far, won’t backtrack.Don’t you think the coming together of Congress and UML may ensure political stability?Instability is okay for me because stability may not necessarily be good for a country like ours. See, a single leader has been ruling a party continuously for over 30 years. What if they rule the country in a similar way? Look at some countries where a single leader has ruled for decades. The current arrangement is better than such stability.Will the Maoist party chairman and prime minister, who didn’t even appoint a minister from a Dalit community, have the moral authority to again champion the agenda of the oppressed?Appointing a minister is again an ornamental approach to appease certain communities. What we should do is ensure the participation of oppressed communities in policymaking.But party chair Dahal may again seek ways to get back to power. Will he pay attention to these issues?We should stop this chase for power at all cost. We will say this in our party meetings. We should accept the reality that we have just 32 seats and so we won’t get sufficient space to implement any important programmes even if we join the government.The way your party chief remained in power for over 18 months using various tactics, was it right?If you see it through a parliamentarian’s lens, it looks quite smart. If you see it through a Marxist perspective, just becoming a prime minister is futile if you can’t implement your policies and strengthen republicanism and participatory democracy. \nThe Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML last week reached an agreement to form a coalition government under the leadership of UML chair KP Sharma Oli. As a part of the package, they also aim to make certain changes to the constitution. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asked Pradeep Gyawali, deputy general secretary of UML, the reasons behind the coming together of the two largest parties, how they plan to run the government and to review and amend the constitution.Many are seeing the Congress-UML alliance as something unusual. What factors brought the two largest parties together even as there is no crisis-like situation or a special task such as constitution writing?Definitely, in normal parliamentary practice, the two largest parties don’t forge an alliance to run a government. The party that gets the biggest mandate leads the government, and the other big party remains in the opposition to make the ruling force accountable. In Nepal, the country’s two major forces, the Congress and the UML, have also joined hands in certain junctures for certain purposes. They worked together to make the constitution in 1990, to conduct general elections in 1999, to complete transition after the 2006 people’s movement and to bring out the constitution in 2015. We felt a need for a similar collaboration this time around. After the November 2022 elections, we saw three alliances in our parliament. At first, Maoist Centre chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal became prime minister with our support, but he failed to abide by the agreement sincerely. He changed the coalition within a month. The subsequent alliance between the Congress and the Maoist Centre lasted for a year. He again sought the UML’s support. Within four months of the March 4 deal with the UML, he started yet another gameplan to join hands with the Congress under the pretext of forming a national consensus government. It was quite unusual for the prime minister himself to instigate instability in the government. He publicly boasted that he had a ‘magical number’ [32 seats in the House of Representatives]. He thought that he could employ the tactic of ‘use and throw’ with the two largest parties and rule the country for the full term. He was completely indifferent to people’s plight, the country’s pressing issues and service delivery. This was the height of irresponsibility. So, the UML and Congress leaders concluded that the time had come to intervene to ensure political stability and service delivery and make sure public frustration doesn’t get out of hand. Did external factors play a role? Recent statements by UML leaders suggest that the party has taken it seriously. When national forces are weak, the neighbouring countries and international forces become more cautious, even more so given Nepal’s geo-political situation. Some of their concerns are valid. They fear political instability in Nepal may have an adverse impact on their genuine issues. We have to take this naturally. Second, it is no secret that we have a long legacy of facing external interference. Sometimes such interventions are carried out covertly and sometimes overtly. Therefore, national forces should be strong. Some political parties and leaders have a tendency of seeking external forces’ support to fulfil their vested interests. In return, they serve the external forces’ undue interests. Formation of a government is a purely domestic affair, but in our case sometimes it also becomes an issue of geopolitical interest. It is said that the UML was spooked when it learned that Prime Minister Dahal had reportedly approached the Congress for a new alliance. This reportedly happened after Dahal returned from New Delhi following Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s swearing-in.We were taken by surprise when the Congress leaders told us that the prime minister had reached out to them with a proposal to form a national consensus government. We were informed about the development from the leaders of the main opposition party. When we reached the March 4 deal with the prime minister, we thought he came to us with a commitment to course correction. Based on that, we supported him almost unconditionally. We didn’t bargain while sharing ministerial portfolios and didn’t talk about the prime minister’s term. We had even thought of allowing Dahal to run the government for the full term if the government functioned well and people were satisfied. We hadn’t even imagined that we would have to think about changing the coalition within four months.We definitely had certain grievances such as a lack of consultation with our party and our lawmakers while preparing the government’s policies and programmes and while allocating budget. Our party chair brought up this issue with the prime minister. But our concerns weren’t addressed. They had already started to ignore us. There were several issues with the prime minister, but we were committed to the partnership. But they had already gone too far. Fortunately, the Congress leaders didn’t accept the offer and instead raised critical questions about the rationale behind the proposal. Basically, the Congress didn’t trust Prachanda ji [Dahal] and came to us. It concluded that Dahal didn’t come with the intent of solving the country’s problems but to manoeuvre between the Congress and the UML.Besides jointly running the government, constitution amendment is another major aspect of the latest Congress-UML deal. What are the provisions the parties want to change?There are four major objectives of this agreement. Safeguarding national interest; strengthening economy; improving governance and service delivery; and ensuring political stability. A debate has started that some constitutional provisions are not helping maintain political stability. What we have said is that it’s been almost a decade since the promulgation of this constitution. Some of its provisions are yet to be implemented. On the other hand, provincial governments complain that they have not been able to work in a full-fledged way because the federal government has still not made some laws they need. So, first, we will undertake a comprehensive review on the progress in the course of implementing the constitution and the challenges we faced in the past decade, among other things. While doing so, we will find out if there are provisions that have posed challenges in maintaining political stability and running a stable government and suggest amendments accordingly.So, it’s not only about the amendment but also about review, assessment and recommendation for amendment, if there is a need. Even if the amendment process begins, it will be limited to ensuring political stability and won’t touch other aspects of the statute. There is no need to over-react. For instance, some Maoist leaders are trying to make it a political issue by describing it as a regressive move. That is wrong.So as per the two-party deal, the statute will be reviewed but not necessarily amended?Yes, whether to go for amendments will depend on the findings of the review. No constitution in the world is perfect. Its success largely depends on the practitioners. So, first we have to differentiate between the role of the constitution and the practitioners. It is true that our society is divided over certain provisions of our constitution. All these issues will be considered, but the fundamental features of the constitution such as democracy, inclusion and federalism won’t be altered. Our priority would be to only remove hindrances in making the system more functional, people-oriented and productive.Of late, people are debating the electoral system, provincial structure and secularism. Will these issues also be dealt with?Federalism is a new system for us. In fact, it is still an in-the-making process in Nepal. We have to note some timelines while analysing the performance of provinces. After the provincial and federal elections in 2017, the first provincial governments were formed in 2018, and they worked for around three years in a stable way. With small cabinets, they worked genuinely to strengthen the provincial system. At the time, most provincial cabinets had around six to seven ministers. They weren’t severely criticised at the time. The wrong trends in the provinces started with the division of the then Nepal Communist Party and the fall of the NCP-led governments at the centre as well as provinces. We saw the trend of horse-trading in provinces. Small parties made unjustified bargaining for ministerial portfolios, chief ministers started splitting ministries and increasing the number of ministers in their cabinets. Also, the November 2022 polls again gave a fragmented verdict, further augmenting the instability and anomalies at the provincial level. So, the problem is the way we are handling things more than the provincial structures. The time isn’t ripe to seek an alternative to the provinces. As far as the electoral model is concerned, we included proportional electoral (PR) system after long debates and discussions. Based on three general elections held after 1990, a conclusion was drawn that the first-past-the-post (FPTP) model couldn’t properly represent the historically under-represented sections. The premise is still valid. Based on the achievements, we may exclude certain communities from the list. But that time hasn’t come. Two questions raised over the use of PR are valid. Is the system really doing justice to the strata and class of the society for which it was introduced? This is the question not about the PR system but the leaders who use it. Similarly, some questions: Is proportional representation required in executive as well because representation is basically vital for policy making? The forms and modalities of the PR system might be discussed, but no one has even thought of removing the inclusive system.Similar is the case with secularism. The spirit is to make the state patron of all religions in the country. However, some sections of society have often tried to misuse and misinterpret the new constitutional provision. They try to interpret secularism as openly allowing rampant religious conversion, and some have made it an excuse to attack the age-old Sanatan faith. For instance, if the President or prime minister visits Lumbini, gurudwara or a shrine of any other faith on certain occasions, that is taken positively, but when they visit Pashupatinath Temple, a section of people raise questions. These activities have made some people think that these attacks on our Sanatan faith are taking place because of the secular system. There is no problem in the constitutional provision because the statute added an explanatory note that states, “‘secular’ means religious, cultural freedoms, including protection of religion and culture handed down from time immemorial.” But some extremist activities have given wrong impressions.Some experts believe the problem of fragmented mandate can be addressed by increasing the threshold required for a political party to be eligible to get PR seats, which can be done by amending laws. Will the Congress-UML alliance opt for this?Yes, this is one feasible option. I am in favour of this. As per the existing provision, a political party can secure seats under the PR category by securing 3 percent votes in the federal parliament and 1.5 percent votes in provincial assemblies. If a political organisation doesn’t even represent 5 or 7 or 10 percent of the population, what can they contribute to the country? You do politics to represent a sizable population and get a public mandate. Otherwise, the presence of such groups would only promote unreasonable bargaining and instigate instability in governments. This can be one of the agenda of the discussion between the two parties.This time, leaders have made it transparent that chiefs of the two parties will lead the government on a rotational basis. But why have other details of the agreement not been made public?There hasn’t been topic-wise discussions on specific provisions. The broader understanding is to review and assess the implementation aspect of the constitution and move ahead based on the findings of the assessment. We have also made it clear that such an act will be guided only by the objective of ensuring political stability and we will not go beyond that. Who will undertake this type of constitution review?We haven’t worked on it in detail. We haven’t reached any understanding. Naturally, inputs will be taken from the constitution makers, experts on constitutional law and politicians involved in this field. But no decision has been made on its nitty-gritty.The Rastriya Prajatantra Party that wants to revive the Hindu kingdom was the first party to welcome the Congress-UML deal while the Maoist Centre has accused Congress and UML of making a regressive move. So don’t you think this affair is tricky?I don’t think the political parties will touch the issues that the RPP talks about, such as reinstatement of Hindu kingdom and dissolution of federalism. No one is thinking about that. Also, the questions raised by the Maoist leaders have no meaning. They are only trying to make a political agenda.It also seems that the Congress and the UML floated this idea of reviewing the constitution to make a case for the two largest parties to form the government.That’s not true. This question undermines the spirit of this agreement. If this system fails, people will raise questions mainly to the leaders of the Congress and the UML, not Prachanda. It’s not only about running the government. We were already in the government and it isn’t a big deal for the Congress to return to power. If democracy fails, the democratic forces will lose the most. So we are genuinely working on this. The Congress and the UML are historical rival forces in Nepali politics. How can the two work together in government?It is true that the Congress and the UML are the two major competitors of this country. But we have some converging factors. First, we both believe in a broader democratic framework. Sometimes, the Congress may give more emphasis on liberal values while we may push for more socialism-oriented programmes. But the common ground is democratic values. We also have the experience of successfully carrying out certain tasks jointly. We may have some friction but we also have experience of managing bitter intra-party fighting as well as inter-party rivalry.How will the ministerial portfolios be shared in the new coalition?We haven’t reached any agreement in detail. As we aim to make this a ‘national consensus government’ we are in favour of accommodating other parties. So it will depend on the number of parties that join the Cabinet. Our only concern is that ministerial allocations should be done in a way that doesn’t weaken the prime minister in order to ensure that the head of the government can deliver.How can a government without the Maoist Centre and some other parties be called a consensus government?We have to wait for that. Leaders of political parties that fiercely criticise the government also join the Cabinet under one or other pretext. Some political parties seemingly cannot exist without being in the government.  \nToday, Nepal is expected to experience partly to generally cloudy conditions.
