Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nThe preliminary findings of the parliamentary special probe committee investigating crisis-ridden cooperatives suggest that the cooperative sector is on the brink of collapse, according to a committee member.“As the government bodies that were supposed to regulate the cooperatives sector failed to efficiently perform their duties, the situation has now gone beyond our control,” a committee member told the Post on the condition of anonymity. The committee has seven members.“This problem could pose a challenge to the overall economy,” the member further said. “The probe committee is yet to reach its final conclusion.”The special probe committee, which began its work a month ago, reached this assessment after a month-long discussion with top officials from government agencies, as well as chiefs and members of various panels formed so far by the government to look into problems involving cooperatives. The special parliamentary probe, which was formed on May 28, has been given three months to complete its task and submit a report to the government. It held its eleventh meeting on Monday. The cooperatives operating within their defined limits are functioning efficiently, the member said. “However, those that breached their bounds have faced problems.”After weeks of negotiations between the ruling and opposition parties, a seven-member committee led by CPN-UML lawmaker Surya Thapa was constituted to investigate the embezzlement of deposits in dozens of cooperatives across the country. Earlier, the Nepali Congress, the main opposition party, disrupted parliamentary proceedings for months, demanding such a committee. Besides Thapa, other members of the committee are Sarita Bhusal of the UML; Badri Pandey and Ishwari Devi Neupane of the Congress; Lekh Nath Dahal of the CPN (Maoist Centre); Shishir Khanal of the Rastriya Swatantra Party; and Dhruba Bahadur Pradhan of the Rastriya Prajantara Party. The committee had started drafting its work procedures on June 5 and began investigations on June 18.Numraj Khanal, an undersecretary at the Parliament Secretariat, says that until now, the special probe committee has tried to understand the conceptual framework of cooperatives after discussing the issue of misappropriation of cooperatives funds with various stakeholders. “During this period, we have discussed the issue with officials from regulatory bodies of cooperatives and with law enforcement agencies and tried to understand their findings on the matter,” Khanal told the Post. “Likewise, we also have discussed the issue with chiefs and representatives of various commissions the government formed in different times starting since 1990.”From 1990 to 2024, the Nepal government formed at least seven different committees to investigate the cooperatives sector’s problems and recommend solutions. The parliamentary special committee held a discussion with Maha Prasad Adhikari, the governor of Nepal Rastra Bank, on Monday. Governor Adhikari said that the current problem in cooperatives is clearly the result of the government allowing an unlimited number of cooperatives to operate throughout the country, said Surya Bahadur Thapa, the coordinator of the Parliamentary Special Probe Committee.Thapa said that Governor Adhikari pointed out a few more reasons.“Allowing cooperatives to run without defining their geographic boundaries, permitting them to collect deposits without any limit, and lack of effective regulation are some other reasons behind the problems seen in the cooperatives sector,” Thapa quoted Adhikari as saying.Adhikari called for setting up a powerful regulatory body to oversee the sector.The special committee has yet to start investigation into the Gorkha Media Network, though it falls under its jurisdiction. The media company has been accused of rerouting money from various cooperatives to the now dysfunctional Galaxy 4K television, where Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane used to be the managing director.“The panel is yet to study the details related to the Gorkha Media Network,” under-secretary Khanal said.Before this, the committee had on July 4 summoned Secretary of the Ministry of Home Affairs Ek Narayan Aryal, and the Inspector General of Police (IGP) Basanta Bahadur Kunwar, among other officials, to discuss the cooperatives under investigation.Apart from Home Secretary Aryal and IGP Kunwar, Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) Chief Shyam Gyawali and Crime Investigation Department Chief Tek Bahadur Tamang were also invited to the committee on the day.Thapa said they discussed the matter in detail with the home secretary, the IGP, and other senior security officials.According to a member, some committee members grilled IGP Kunwar about his previous statement in the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee. Speaking at the parliamentary committee meeting in the last week of March, the Nepal Police chief had claimed that police had found no evidence of Home Minister Lamichhane’s involvement in cooperatives fraud.“When I made the statement in the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee about the home minister, his involvement in the scam had not been disclosed,” a committee member quoted IGP Kunwar as saying at the special committee meeting.Another member of the probe committee, Shishir Khanal, said the IGP said he was not under any pressure to give a statement about Home Minister Lamichhane. Khanal is a lawmaker from the Lamichhane-led Rastriya Swatantra Party.“The IGP said that he spoke on the basis of facts, and that no information regarding Home Minister Lamichhane’s involvement in the cooperatives scam had been found till the day he made the statement.” In the course of seeking inputs from various stakeholders, the committee on July 2 wrote to all the national political parties seeking their suggestions on how to resolve the cooperatives crisis. Two weeks earlier, the panel had asked nine cooperatives on its list (under Schedule 2 of ToR) to submit details of their financial transactions. The special committee is mandated to investigate troubled cooperatives, their legal and institutional objectives, financial systems, regulations, supervision, and transparency. Another task of the panel is to recommend measures for immediate return of savings to the depositors of the problematic cooperatives identified by the Department of Cooperatives and the crisis-ridden cooperatives management committee.  \nAs heavy monsoon rains cause chaos across the country, dengue cases are surging in several districts, including Kathmandu.According to the Health Office Kathmandu, around 18 people are infected with the dengue virus every day. Officials, however, admit that this number could be just the tip of the iceberg, as the office gets reports only from 18 health facilities.“Yes, the number of people infected with the dengue virus could be several times higher than suggested by the reports we are getting every day,” said Dr Arjun Sapkota, chief of the Health Office, Kathmandu. “We are working to make daily reporting of dengue cases mandatory for private health facilities as well.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vectors also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus, according to the World Health Organisation.According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,432 people from 73 districts have been infected with the virus since January this year. Among the 73 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases with 159, followed by Jhapa with 120, Chitwan 83, Makawanpur 65, Tanahun and Doti 49 cases each, and Okhaldhunga and Sindhupalchowk 46 each.Sapkota informed that his office has sensitised the local bodies about the looming risk of a massive dengue outbreak in the coming days.“Mandatory reporting of dengue cases every day is among the preventive measures through which we can identify dengue hotspots,” said Sapkota. “This will help health workers target such measures in particular areas. Additionally, starting this week, we are resuming the “10 minutes at 10 am” initiative every Friday, during which mosquito breeding grounds will be destroyed.”Officials informed that several local units, including the Kathmandu Metropolitan City, have already started preventive measures against dengue. Dengue symptoms include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes. Patients with these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and proper medical care can prevent death.Doctors say many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and can be treated with paracetamol at home.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district. Since then, an increasing number of dengue infections, including major outbreaks, have been reported from many districts. Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Though the post-monsoon period is considered the dengue epidemic season, the deadly disease has already become endemic in Nepal, as outbreaks are reported every month, including in the winter months.According to health workers, storage places for scrap materials, discarded cups, plastic material tossed in open spaces, and unused lands will be potential hotspots for the dengue virus in the coming days. Health workers have warned the owners of these sites that action will be taken if mosquito larvae are found there.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects, such as plastic cups and bottles, could be breeding grounds for these mosquitoes. \nThe government last week raised the minimum support price for paddy by more than 6.5 percent for the harvest of the next fiscal year, 2023-24, soon after the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led administration was reduced to a minority.This was the second time the government fixed the minimum support price during the paddy transplantation period. The Ministry of Commerce and Supplies tabled the proposal to increase the price, which was approved by the Cabinet meeting on July 4.The government decided to increase the minimum support price of common paddy to Rs3,580.62 per quintal (Rs35.80 per kg), up 6.50 percent. Similarly, the floor price for ‘mota dhan’ has been increased to Rs3,410.51 per quintal (Rs34.10 per kg), up 6.64 percent.The minimum support price is the lowest legal price that farmers receive for their harvests. The government does not fix the floor price of fine paddy.A minimum support price is an intervention by the government to protect farmers against sudden slumps in market prices. It is the rate at which the government buys farm produce when no other buyers are in the market.Usually, it is announced in time for farmers to make their production plans before the beginning of the planting season. Under the scheme, the government has to buy a certain amount of the total paddy harvest.In 2012, the government announced the resumption of the policy of fixing the minimum price following complaints that middlemen had been determining the market rate.Until 1999, the minimum support price for paddy and wheat would be announced regularly.According to reports, the practice was fully abandoned that year after the government launched the 20-year Agriculture Perspective Plan.Even when the minimum support price was announced, it was irrelevant as it was set well below the projected market price to protect the government from having to buy farm products should prices tumble.Moreover, reports said that even when support prices were announced, it was not done in time.The policy was irregular.In 2016-17, the minimum support price was announced in mid-November. In 2017-2018, the Cabinet sent back the supplies ministry's proposal. In 2021-22, the government announced the minimum support price for paddy on November 3, which is harvest time. The price was raised by 8 percent.On different occasions, members of parliamentary committees have criticised the government policy as ‘absurd’ because it was announced after many farmers had already harvested and sold their crops. Lawmakers said that the minimum support price was supposed to encourage farmers to boost output, but the government-fixed floor price had ‘discouraged’ them instead.It was only since the last fiscal year that the government announced the price before the transplantation season started.Paddy is transplanted in June and harvested by the end of October.This year, as of Sunday, paddy transplantation has been completed on 539,766 hectares as of Sunday, which is 38.6 percent of Nepal's 1.39 million hectares of paddy fields.Tilak Raj Chaulagain, a senior agro economist at the Department of Agriculture, said that the paddy transplantation rate was slightly lower (by 4 percent) compared to the same period last year. This year, the monsoon entered Nepal from the east on June 10, three days ahead of its usual onset date, according to the Meteorological Forecasting Division.Chaulagain said that the monsoon arrived on time, but it took time to be active. “As a result, transplantation was delayed slightly in the hills, but this will not affect production or productivity.\"According to Chaulagain, while transplantation on the hills is nearing completion, it will pick up pace in Tarai from mid-July. The Tarai, the largest paddy-producing region in the country, accounts for 71 percent of the total rice acreage. The hills account for 25 percent, and the mountain region for 4 percent.“Since there are no reports of a shortage of chemical fertilisers this year, we expect transplantation to be completed within a month and a half at this pace,” said Chaulagain.According to the department, Madhesh has the lowest translation rate of all provinces. In Madhesh province, which commands the lion’s share of the paddy fields, transplantation has been completed on 97,851 hectares, which is 25.5 percent of the 383,150 hectares available paddy fields in the province. Nepal’s economic well-being is closely tied to the rainy season. Rainwater is the lifeblood of Nepal's Rs5.70 trillion economy, which relies heavily on agriculture, with nearly two-thirds of the farmlands being rain-fed.During the four months of June to September, a large part of the country receives nearly 80 percent of its annual rainfall.The production of food grain, mainly rice, depends on the amount and distribution of monsoon rainfall over the country. The monsoon rains also replenish groundwater and reservoirs critical for drinking and power generation. \nThe Nepali fashion market is currently flooded with fast fashion imports and dominated by wear-and-throw clothing. In this somewhat bleak scene, Sangram, a fashion brand with its atelier located in Maharjgunj, stands out by offering a refreshing change to the Nepali fashion scene with its beautifully designed elevated basics that are sustainably made and impeccably tailored.The brand’s collections, vision, and creative direction set it apart. Its memorability is enhanced by its intuitive, artistic photoshoots, where models stand straight and stare intensely into the camera, reminiscent of Marcelo Gaia’s New York-based brand Mirror Palais. Unlike Mirror Palais’s dreamy fashion shoots, which feature ivory backgrounds and fairytale-like clothing, Sangram takes a melancholic approach. The photographs adopt a dark hue, and the models display grim expressions.In one of its shoots titled ‘Incoherency’, photographed by Mirage Gurung, the brand offers viewers a visual feast. The photos feature three models, with the central figure adorned in an extravagant, voluminous neon orange dress and a large, ruffled mask.The interplay of the models’ gazes, or lack thereof, creates stunning visual poetry. The brand’s collections are varied and diverse, but the mood of the photographs is usually consistent, representing Sangram as a brand visually.The brand has also ventured into filmmaking to showcase its collections. In the short film ‘Ghar’, clothing is showcased ingeniously, despite its promotional intent. It is refreshing to see how meaning, intention, and artistry are woven into Sangram’s brand identity through its elaborate photoshoots and dedicated films in the Nepali fashion scene. Sandesh Sangram Rai, 28, the founder and creative director of the brand, launched it during the Covid-19 pandemic. Previously an anthropology student, he brings more than just fashion to the table. This is evident through the brand's recently ended exhibition, which offered a unique wearable experience featuring capsule wardrobes and designs inspired by concurrent art pieces.The exhibition was immersive and intuitive, engaging both individual and collective consciousness. It explored themes like mental health and femininity while also addressing fashion waste. This was achieved not just by acknowledging the existence of fashion waste, but by ensuring minimal waste and sustainability practices in the exhibition itself. Rai, the founder, explained why he chose Khapinchhen Tole for the exhibition instead of other art museums or clubs. Influenced by the Kirat Kipat system, where communities unite for common goals without hidden agendas, the exhibition embodies this spirit of collective effort and altruism. Local women served Newari food throughout the exhibition, and community members supported its construction. Rai added, “Khapinchhen is deeply rooted and welcoming, and to receive permission to create art in such a historic and beautiful space was truly special for us.”The exhibition featured capsule collections based on artworks by Mina Garbuja, Suruchi BK, Suza Magar, Yanjan Kumar Joshi, and Sandesh Sangram Rai. Garbuja’s collection was centred around the art piece ‘Tied Up Femininity’, featuring traditional laccha dori. These laccha dori contain notes written by women sharing stories of the challenges faced while growing up as girls. Visitors were encouraged to add their own notes, reflecting on their journey from girlhood to adulthood or sharing personal stories, including experiences of sexual abuse if they wish, and hang them on the laccha dori.According to Garbuja, her clothing collection, inspired by the art piece, focused on clean lines, subtle details, and minimal, toned-down colours. She incorporates pleats, draping, and straps as the primary design elements in women’s clothing, referencing the concept of dori or laccha dori in her capsule collection. Suza Magar’s collection was inspired by an art piece titled ‘Nightmare and Paranoia’. This piece features a stark, cold bunk bed adorned with red yarn. This immersive installation invites visitors to sleep on the bed and experience the discomfort of having yarn near their faces, recreating the unsettling feeling associated with nightmares.Magar’s collection embraced this theme by incorporating textured fabrics, nets, pleats, and prints designed to evoke feelings of unease and vulnerability in the wearer.Yanjan Kumar Joshi’s capsule collection was inspired by an art piece, but he interprets it differently from what initially meets the eye. According to him, “This installation represents the artist's mind as a chaotic mess, but also as a comforting meadow where inspiration and joy are found.”His collection features reused buttons as appliqués, minimal fabric wastage, and versatile, unisex designs.Sandesh Sangram Rai adds that the scrap fabrics will be reused and upcycled to create other materials. He further explains that salvaged and previously unused muslin fabric will also be repurposed.Rai underscores that all materials used in the exhibition will focus on reuse or upcycling, highlighting the brand’s commitment to sustainability and minimal waste.Another captivating art piece, titled ‘Wrapped up in my Ama’s Saree’, showcases numerous sarees suspended from the ceiling, forming an elaborate and visually engaging installation. This piece explores the notion that societal norms can restrain individuals, with the sarees symbolising the burdens imposed by societal ills.Suruchi BK’s collection drew inspiration from this art piece. In her designs, she creatively utilises upcycled sarees to craft innovative pieces. This approach not only breathes new life into unused sarees but also addresses the issue of waste in fashion.The exhibition was divided into two floors: one showcasing the art pieces alongside the clothing collections, while the top floor featured a changing room and items from Sangram’s previous collections.This setup aptly earned the exhibition its title as a ‘wearable exhibition’, allowing visitors to select clothes they like, try them on, and experience the garments as art pieces themselves. This approach underscores their innovative integration of clothing displays and art exhibitions.Like previous photography and filmmaking campaigns, the exhibition integrated various art forms into fashion, imbuing it with deeper significance. It adopted a runway approach without the traditional runway setting by allowing each garment to convey a meaningful story accompanied by art installations.The clothes presented in the exhibition are available for purchase. \nThe monsoon has been causing havoc right across Nepal in the past couple of days. At least 70 people have been killed in floods, landslides and other monsoon-related disasters since June 10, according to the Nepal Police. Five others were missing and 86 people were injured in water-induced disasters over a month. There must have been many other incidents not included in official records. The monsoon entered Nepal from its eastern part in the second week of June. Heavy rainfalls that caused huge damage in Bagmati, Gandaki and Lumbini provinces until Sunday, wreaked havoc in far-western Nepal on Monday.As a country with over 83 percent of its land covered by hills and mountains, Nepal is always at the risk of landslides and floods mainly in the monsoon period. Similarly, people in the southern belt are tormented by inundation. Monsoon-related disasters are a yearly occurrence. The Monsoon Preparedness and Response Plan 2024 estimated that over 412,000 households may be affected and of them over 83,000 are likely to be badly hit by monsoon-related disasters this season. In a decade between April 2014 to April 2024, there were 1,602 recorded floods and 2,840 landslides. At least 3,052 people were killed, 791 went missing and 4,176 were injured in the period, according to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority. Similarly, 16,054 buildings and other structures were damaged. This shows the magnitude of the losses caused by monsoon-related disasters in the country.As heavy rains have battered almost all parts of the country, a large number of people have been struggling to deal with the disasters. Besides deaths, missing and injuries, thousands have been displaced and taking shelter in nearby places. In such times, saving lives by rescuing people trapped in difficult situations should be the government’s first priority. Logically, what follows is shifting people from disaster-prone areas to safer places, swiftly distributing reliefs and working on a plan to rehabilitate the displaced. Though our three security agencies often do a commendable job of saving people’s lives, they are still not well-equipped. Just months ago, some of them died while trying to contain wildfires. Rescuers should be equipped with better gears and other logistics before they set out on rescue missions. Moreover, relief distribution and rehabilitation works often court controversy either because of substandard quality of the goods distributed, or the irregularities while carrying out the task.When it comes to rehabilitating flood victims, our state agencies have utterly failed. Thousands of people have been languishing in either nearby forest areas, on riverbanks or other unsafe places for years where they had supposedly been shifted for a few months. For instance, floods in Koshi in August 2008 displaced 7,563 families from the present-day Shreepur, Haripur, and West Kushaha, located across different wards of Koshi Rural Municipality. But they are still living in makeshift huts and mud houses as the government has failed to properly rehabilitate them in the past 16 years. The Koshi Flood Victims Struggle Committee is fighting for their basic rights. A state that cannot ensure the basic safety of its citizens, we are afraid, has gotten its priorities badly wrong.    \nA week ago, on July 2, at midnight, Nepali Congress president Sher Bahadur Deuba and Communist Party of Nepal-UML chairperson KP Sharma Oli struck a deal to form an alliance to rule the country. The two largest parties in Parliament secretly agreeing to form a ruling coalition is an anomaly for any democracy. More worryingly, the nation is still kept in the dark about the terms of the agreement.What do they have to hide? From whom? Why? As The Kathmandu Post observed immediately, this secrecy is “a sign of dishonesty” amongst the ruling elites. It’s legitimate to suspect why they would conceal the agreement for so long if there was nothing controversial or sinister about it. The Canadian novelist Gilbert Parker said, “In all secrets there is a kind of guilt, however beautiful or joyful they may be…secrecy means evasion, and evasion means a problem to the moral mind.” The oppressed are beginning to worry that the deal is a conspiracy against them, that it will bolster Brahmanism and curtail their rights and privileges. Achievements under threat?Many of the oppressed and their allies suspect that the deal between the Congress and the UML leadership includes agendas such as the following: (i) the abolition of federalism (ii) the reinstatement of the Hindu nation (iii) the termination of proportional representation in the elections, and (iv) end of the caste-based quota system. A mix of internal and external factors seems to have contributed to the mainstream party leaders, their MPs and other influential politicians desiring the above-mentioned changes. For one thing, almost all the major players in the corridors of power are high-caste Hindu men from the hills who have naturally been unhappy with the declaration of Nepal as a secular state. The fact that the constitution has betrayed the very meaning of secularism—by openly stressing the promotion and preservation of the Hindu religion as a central goal of secularism—has not satisfied the conservative Hindu minds. These strongly religious and traditional people dominate not just the government and parties but all the state bodies, including the judiciary, army and police. No wonder, a significant number of Nepali Congress MPs recently wrote to their party leadership asking for a return of the Hindu nation. A few Dalit MPs, too, joined the call for a Hindu nation—without perhaps realising how much self-harm their action is likely to do. There’s a similar Hindubadi sentiment amongst many communist politicians. Dr Ambedkar was right when he noted that upper-caste Hindus cannot be true communists!Another possible factor responsible for initiating the aforementioned regressive steps is the risk of the king’s return. Parties are understandably concerned about monarchy making a comeback as a consequence of their own poor governance. In the short term, there’s also the chance of the monarchist force, Rastriya Prajatantra Party, making electoral gains due to the unpopularity of the mainstream parties. So, perhaps the two biggest parties opted to return to, in essence, the constitution of 1991, albeit without the monarchy. They may have seen this as the only feasible way to preserve their hold in a fast-changing society against the onslaught of both the monarchists and the populists. The latter has, in fact, posed a bigger threat than the royalists in recent years. Equally powerful seems to be the external factor: The Hindu nationalist pressure from India. The return of Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party to power may have forced the parties to concede to Delhi’s demand to reinstate Nepal as the world’s only Hindu nation.No matter how much he desires, Prime Minister Modi cannot turn his own country into an officially Hindu state. But Nepal may be coerced to that end. He can easily exert great pressure on a small and weak neighbour like Nepal, which is also invariably ruled by upper-caste Hindus. The current geopolitical situation may have emboldened Modi’s resolve to revive Nepal as a Hindu nation. The Western powers, mainly the United States of America and Europe, do have some influence in Nepal as bilateral and multilateral donors. However, these powers have lost their moral high ground because of their blind support to the Jewish and apartheid state of Israel in its genocide of the Palestinians. Dark days ahead?I hope my speculations will turn out to be completely wrong. But more and more members of the Dalit and ethnic minority communities have become increasingly nervous about what may be coming. Many members of these communities who are aligned with the Congress and the UML, too, feel that the days ahead do not look good. If you mix Hindu nationalist politics with the already deeply embedded cultural Hinduism, all you get is a society that is much more casteist and bigoted, i.e., more intolerant towards Dalits, tribal groups, religious minorities and Muslims in particular. Officially, a Hindu state means an officially caste apartheid state—a Brahmanist, Manubadi state. This is crystal clear. Then, the Manubadi laws will further overshadow modern and secular laws, thus emboldening orthodox and conservative Hindu elements. Caste discrimination and untouchability will become much more accepted, if not encouraged, in society.Likewise, ending the federal system is tantamount to bulldozing the ethnic identity and rights of ethnic and/or indigenous communities. At a time when some people are still clamouring for ethnic identity—as we’ve recently seen in eastern Nepal, including the parliamentary elections in Ilam, as well as the ongoing anti-cable-car movement in Pathivara temple—the new Oli regime will be doing everything possible to further divide and weaken ethnic activism. Getting rid of the little privileges and benefits we’ve been receiving through the quota system will be another disaster. Suppose the Oli and Deuba regimes choose to implement the recommendations made by the Inclusion Commission (which exclusively comprises Bahun officials), the quota allocations will be made purely based on class. This means the lower classes from the upper castes will reap much of the benefits, and the current outrage from certain quarters on the reservation to Dalits will vanish.In the endIt’s not yet known what issues Deuba and Oli have agreed upon—but whatever it is, it doesn’t look good. It seems surreal and potentially dangerous to our future. Why would they hide the agreement if it wouldn’t cause some sort of unhappiness amongst some communities? The leaders’ likely goal is to keep the majority happy, which often means pandering to the interests of the traditional and conservative upper castes and those of the orthodox neighbours. This often entails curtailing the already limited rights and privileges of the oppressed groups. Yet, I’d say, let’s not despair! We should, however, remain watchful. The contents of the mysterious bag will be out in the open sooner or later. If the septuagenarian leaders attempt to further destroy us and deny our dignity and rights, it may give rise to a new opportunity for the divided and disillusioned peoples to come together. The government may thus indirectly encourage Dalits, Janajatis, Madhesis and other marginalised groups to unite and fight.  \nIn the early 1980s, Nepal’s firebrand communist leader, Mohan Bikram Singh, split from his comrade Nirmal Lama to establish a radical political alternative. Lama and Singh had earlier revolted from the Communist Party of Nepal to establish their own faction after the party’s fourth convention in 1974. Among Singh’s trusted leaders were Mohan Baidya, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, CP Gajurel and Dev Gurung. But Singh was forced to spend most of the following years politically exiled in India. As a result, Baidya effectively captured the party, renaming it the Communist Party of Nepal (CPN), “Mashal,” pronounced slightly different from Lama’s CPN “Masal.” However, Baidya and many senior party leaders faced self-imposed demotion after the party suffered a strategic setback in the now infamous ‘Sector Scandal’. Baidya was forced to nominate Dahal as the party leader in 1989, a position Dahal has held for three and a half decades.During the first two decades of his leadership, Dahal reigned supreme, as his party led the country into a decade-long violent political conflict that claimed, by some estimates, over 16,000 lives. Despite substantial economic and political costs, the conflict accelerated Nepal’s transition from a semi-feudal society with an exclusive political system into a more inclusive and secular republic. To that end, the Dahal-led Maoist party received due recognition through a popular mandate of the 2008 first Constituent Assembly elections. But Dahal’s unnecessary distrust of Nepal’s more established political parties, which had played a considerable role in bringing his party back into the political mainstream, made him commit blunders and unseated him from a comfortable majority government. His suspicion against fellow comrades who questioned his leadership style and decisions led to multiple splintering of the Maoist party. An insecure leaderDespite leading the country in and out of a transformative political conflict and becoming one of the key signatories of the new constitution, Dahal has remained an insecure leader who takes every opportunity to remind the Nepali people and the world about his “revolutionary contributions”. Possibly, this deep-seated insecurity emerges from the fact that he is neither seen as an intellectually gifted politician like his fellow comrade Baburam Bhattarai, who is known as an ideologue of the Maoist conflict or as a leader with integrity and simplicity like that of his political gurus Singh and Baidya. The thought of losing the political legacy of the ‘People’s War’ despite clinging onto the leadership of the party must constantly haunt the Maoist supremo.Dahal’s insecurity and political hypocrisy were also palpable in the way he derided the Madhesh Movement, which also raised the agendas of federalism and inclusion. Instead of considering them allies, Dahal ordered his party cadres to attack the Madheshi party leaders and their cadres. A large part of the political onus of escalating the tensions leading to the unfortunate Gaur massacre in 2007 will always rest on Dahal. Over the past decade and a half, Dahal has repeatedly failed to display the leadership he is ironically fond of discussing. Despite mobilising thousands of Tharu youths during the conflict, he failed to support their genuine claims on provincial boundaries during the federal structuring. And despite claims of his ‘one-sided love’ for Madhesh, he remained silent as more than 50 Madhesi protesters were indiscriminately killed by the security forces in 2015. Unreliable coalition partnerThere was a time when Dahal led a party that had shaken the country’s political core. Less than two decades later, he now leads a party that has mostly eroded its political base and only relies on a stronger coalition partner to remain relevant. But has Dahal even proved to be a reliable coalition partner? Let’s take a closer look. After Baidya split the party in 2012, the CPN-Maoist was reduced to the third position in the second Constituent Assembly elections, a significant loss from its commanding majority in the first CA. In the following two years, Dahal’s party was not only kept out of power but also forced to endorse a constitution that the Nepali Congress and rival communist party CPN-UML tabled. Having lost the capacity to dictate the political course, Dahal resorted to coalition politics. When the opportunity came, he supported UML’s Khadga Prasad Oli to cobble up a coalition government in October 2015. However, when the Nepali Congress offered him to lead a new coalition, he abandoned Oli and became Prime Minister in 2016. With the 2017 elections on the horizon, Dahal knew his party would not be able to compete with the larger parties that had successfully led the constitution drafting. With some active external mediation, Dahal persuaded Oli for an electoral alliance and even agreed to an eventual unification of the communist forces. When the left unity won a landslide victory, Dahal was convinced that Oli would honour the agreement to hand over power to him mid-way through the four-year period. When Oli refused, he split the united CPN in 2020, convincing several disgruntled leaders like Madhav Nepal to abandon the party and join a coalition with the Nepali Congress. The new coalition also offered Dahal and his party a comfortable division of electoral seats in the 2022 local, provincial and federal elections. But soon after the elections were over, Dahal bargained for power with both Deuba and Oli. Despite having won only 32 seats in the federal parliament with only 11 percent popular vote, Dahal managed to become Nepal’s 33rd Prime Minister in December 2022.Impending downfallIn 2014, political analyst CK Lal had told me that Dahal’s political opportunism would make him relevant in Nepali politics for at least another decade. The Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML took exactly a decade to realise that Dahal had been cashing in on Nepal’s fractured politics. This week, the two parties agreed that Nepal’s long-term political stability requires an introspection into the present electoral system, which allows electorally less popular outfits to dictate the course of national politics. So, not only have the two large parties decided to pull the plug on the Dahal government, but they also agreed to form an independent commission to study and propose amendments to the current electoral provision.While there is little disagreement that the current electoral system paved the way for more representation of the hitherto marginalised sections, the opportunity to correct inefficacies like expensive election campaigning and manipulation of the proportional candidacy lists by the parties must not be dismissed either. There are also serious doubts about the intention of the two parties to strike a deal at a time when the Nepal Police and the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority are investigating some high-profile corruption cases. It is up to the two parties to vindicate their intent by ensuring that the new political course does not interfere in these investigations. And even if the two parties agree to amend the constitutional provisions regarding elections, they will need to gather a national consensus or at least a two-thirds majority. Whatever happens in the next few weeks and months, it is evidently clear Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s eventual political downfall is on the horizon. \nThe text of the midnight deal last Monday whereby the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML agreed to stitch together a new coalition remains hidden, giving rise to much speculation. Yet while talking about the deal, the leaders of the two parties have pointed to the necessity of a ‘national consensus’ government in order to address the country’s pressing problems. This, they say, entails amending the nine-year-old national constitution. Even if the country’s two largest parties come together, they will fall short of a two-thirds majority needed to amend the constitution in the federal lower House. Had they the numbers in the lower chamber, they would have fallen short in the upper House. To amend the constitution, the ruling parties ought to have two-thirds majority in both. This is why many analysts reckon the constitution amendment is no more than an excuse to justify the toppling of the Pushpa Kamal Dahal government. That is unfortunate. The biggest architects of the national charter cannot be so cavalier when it comes to its amendment.The other suspicion is that in pushing for constitution amendment, the two big parties want to significantly reduce the number of proportional representation seats in the two Houses. The reasoning is that the PR seats have allowed many smaller political outfits to enter parliament and to bargain for power with the big parties, thus contributing to political instability. The Congress and the UML also seemingly want to capitalise on the perception that the PR seats are mostly reserved for those close to powerful party chairs rather than for members of the marginalised and under-represented communities, as was envisioned in the constitution. Whatever the case, they should tread carefully. Despite all its flaws, the PR system has significantly increased the political representation of marginalised communities and groups and it would be dangerous to fiddle with it without their buy-in. There is also no guarantee a fully FPTP system will ensure stability. Even before the new constitution came into effect in 2015, not a single government, each one of them formed through direct elections, came close to serving out its full term. This again points to the need for broad consultations—and not a little introspection on the part of our top leaders. A living document that is the constitution can and should be amended on a timely basis, or it becomes irrelevant. But hastily tweaking it could invite more problems than it would solve. It is interesting that many of the high-ranking Congress and UML leaders were unaware of the Monday deal even an hour before it was signed. It is thus hard to believe that the points of agreement were much discussed even inside the two parties, much less in the broader society. For far too long, the leaders of the big parties have treated the apparatus of government pretty much as their personal property. The biggest reason the new federal republican system has not functioned as intended is their sense of entitlement, lack of accountability, and paucity of faith in the system they have themselves championed in public. Unless there is a change in this mindset, no system of governance or election will yield the desired results.  \nThe weather across the country is forecast to be partly to generally cloudy on Tuesday.  Light to moderate rain accompanied by thunder and lightning is expected in several regions, including Koshi Province, Madesh Province, Gandaki Province, and Lumbini Province. Similar conditions may occur sporadically in other parts of the country. The meteorological forecasting division has warned of heavy rainfall in some parts of Koshi, Madhesh, and Gandaki Provinces. Tonight, the weather is expected to remain generally cloudy throughout the country, with light to moderate rainfall. Likewise, moderate rain with thunder and lightning is likely to occur at some places in Koshi Province, Madesh Province, Gandaki Province, and Lumbini Province, as well as at one or two other places in the rest of the country.Heavy rainfall is expected in Koshi, Madesh, Gandaki, and Lumbini Provinces, with the possibility of very heavy rainfall in parts of Koshi Province. The maximum temperature on Monday was recorded at 36.6 degrees Celsius in Janakpur, while Jomsom’s lowest recorded temperature was 14.0 degrees Celsius. \nRussian President Vladimir Putin welcomed Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi late on Monday and toured him around his residence outside Moscow ahead of official talks in the Kremlin on Tuesday.Putin embraced the Indian leader at his home at Novo-Ogaryovo, greeted him as his “dear friend” and said he was “very happy” to see him, according to an account by Russia’s TASS state news agency.“Our official talks are tomorrow, while today in this comfortable, cozy setting we can probably discuss the same issues, but unofficially,” TASS quoted Putin as saying.The Russian president offered Modi, who is on his first visit to Russia in five years, tea, berries and sweets and took him on a tour of the grounds in a motorised cart.Modi’s trip to Moscow and India’s relationship with Russia amid the war that Russia has been waging against Ukraine raise concerns, the US State Department said.Thousands of people have died on both sides since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. India, which has enjoyed a close relationship with Moscow for decades has refused to condemn Russia for the war, instead calling for an end to the conflict through dialogue and diplomacy.Russian state news agencies said Putin and Modi visited the residence’s stable and watched a show with performing horses.A top Indian official said last week that fixing India’s trade imbalance with Russia and securing the discharge of Indian citizens who were “misled” into fighting in the Ukraine war would be among Modi's top priorities in Moscow.India, which has links with Moscow dating from the Soviet era, has increased purchases of cheap Russian oil to record levels. \nAjal Kaji Tamrakar set a new national record in men’s 100 metres butterfly at the First Nepal Aquatics Championship on Monday.Tamrakar took 59.17 seconds at the Heating Swimming Pool in Satdobato, Lalitpur to shatter Anubhav Subba’s record of 59.77 seconds set during the 25th National Open Swimming Competition in 2022.It is Tamrakar’s second national record at the competition after he swam 25.52 seconds to break the men’s 50 metres butterfly record on Saturday. His 25.52 bettered his own previous record of 25.67 seconds he set during the 26th National Open Swimming Competition last year.A total of three national records have been set at the competition.On Saturday, Diwakar Awale made a new record in the men’s 200 metres breaststroke. He had completed the race in 2 minutes 30.15 seconds eclipsing the record of 2 minutes 31.15 seconds achieved by Shubham Sharma at the 13th South Asian Games in 2019.A total of 354 athletes competed in 65 events in the two-day competition.Nisarga Batika School won the team championship with 166 points. St Mary’s School finished second with 53 points. GEMS stood third with 36 points. \nPresident Ramchandra Paudel has authenticated the Bill to amend some Nepal acts related to investment facilitation 2024.The bill passed by both houses of the federal Parliament has been authenticated by President Paudel on Monday in accordance with Article 113 (2) of the constitution, says a statement issued by Shailaja Regmi Bhattarai, spokesperson for the Office of the President.The bill has amended various provisions of the Lands Act, National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act, Land Acquisition Act, Electronic Transactions Act, Special Financial Act, Public Private Partnership and Investment Act, Foreign Investment and Technology Transfer Act, Forest Act and Industrial Enterprises Act to facilitate foreign investment.On April 23, the government forwarded an ordinance to amend nine Acts to clear legal complexities in a bid to attract investors ahead of the third investment summit. The ordinance was later presented in the Parliament and endorsed by both Houses. \nTwo teenage girls drowned and another went missing in a flood in Kanchanpur district on Monday.Superintendent of Police Chakraraj Joshi of Kanchanpur District Police Office said two 15-year-old girls drowned near their homes in Punarbas Municipality-5.The whereabouts of the missing girl are still unknown, and police are actively searching for her. Police said a 12-year-old girl, who was accompanying them, managed to escape.According to the police, they drowned on a flooded road while moving from one neighbourhood to another in the village.Continuous rain for the past two days has submerged most areas of Kanchanpur. Floods in rivers, including the Mahakali, have displaced 900 families in the district. According to the Kanchanpur District Police Office, 3,293 members of 891 households were relocated to safer locations as of Monday morning.Earlier on Sunday, a seven-month-old infant drowned in Krishnapur Municipality after floodwaters entered his house, while a 23-year-old man from Beldandi Rural Municipality-3 went missing after being swept away by the Chaudhar river. \nIn 2019-20, Nepal imported 236 units of passenger electric vehicles (EVs) from China worth some Rs674 million. In the past five years, imports of EVs from China jumped 35 times, suggesting EV adoption in Nepal is now outpacing that of conventional combustion vehicles which use engines that burn fossil fuels, such as petrol or diesel. The EVs have overtaken conventional combustion vehicles.The imports of fossil fuel-consuming passenger vehicles were 10,310 units worth Rs9.24 billion in 2019-20. After four years, in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, imports of conventional combustion vehicles were down to 3,537 units worth Rs4.21 billionHowever, overall vehicle imports have jumped from Rs65.02 billion in 2019-20 to Rs80 billion in the first 11 months of 2023-24.According to the Department of Customs, Nepal imported 11,466 units of EVs worth Rs29 billion in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, or by mid-June. The imports were 3,870 units worth Rs11.23 billion in the same period last fiscal year. Of the total EV imports, a third came from China. Customs data show that Nepal imported 7,931 units of EVs from China, accounting for 69 percent of the total EV imports in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year. This translates to Rs21 billion in value.After China, the majority of EVs were imported from India. In the review period, imports from India amounted to Rs6 billion, or 3,277 units. Until the last fiscal year, India was Nepal’s top EV supplier.The data show that Nepal imported 2,205 EVs worth Rs5.94 billion from India in the last fiscal year. In the same period, imports from China were 1,269 units worth Rs3.75 billion.Nepal’s imports of EVs jumped sharply by 158.23 percent in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year. Importers say BYD, a Chinese multinational, has taken over the Nepali market. The government collected revenue of Rs13.06 billion from the import of EVs in the review period.Akash Golchha, senior vice president of the Nepal Automobile Dealers Association, said the ongoing economic slowdown has not stopped Nepalis from buying EVs. However, petrol or diesel-run vehicle sales could have been better.EV sales and orders saw a dramatic surge before the budget was announced on May 28. Cimex Inc Pvt Ltd, the authorised distributor of BYD Auto Industry Co Ltd in Nepal, said it had achieved a milestone by delivering 50 cutting-edge BYD EVs in a single day on May 18. According to the company, all 50 units were sold from its service centre at Guheshwari, Kathmandu.According to Cimex, the company imported 4,000 EVs in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year. The import of Chinese EVs is high due to their larger production compared to India, said the company, which is among the top EV brands in Nepal.BYD’s Atto and Dolphin are the most preferred models among Nepali customers. With the recent hike in excise and customs duties, the company said the new price list of BYDs will be unveiled soon.“There was fear among buyers that the government may raise duty on EVs in the budget. As a result, the demand surged dramatically,” said Golchha. “The high import increased the stock of EVs.”Automobile dealers said that the government hiked the duty on EVs by 10 percent in the budget for the coming fiscal year 2024-25, which, however, may not impact the sales.Golchha said the government did not make drastic changes in the import duty of EVs in the budget, which may help EV sales boom in the coming days. “The EV demand will grow at a faster pace.”Auto dealers say the import boost for EVs is mainly due to banks’ easy financing. Banks lend up to 90 percent of the vehicle’s cost.Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun, in the annual budget for the upcoming fiscal year, revised the customs and excise duty rates on the import of EVs. The customs duty on EVs of up to 50 kW has been increased to 15 percent from 10 percent, while a 5 percent excise duty has been imposed on them.Likewise, the government increased the customs and excise duties on EVs of 50-100 kW by 5 percent. As per the revised tariffs, the customs duty has been increased to 20 percent from 15 percent, while the excise duty has been increased to 15 percent from 10 percent.The customs duty on 100-200 kW has been raised to 30 percent from 20 percent. Similarly, those in categories 200-300 kW and more than 300 KW will be subject to customs duty of 60 percent and 80 percent, respectively. In these vehicles, the indirect tax has been raised by 20 percent each.According to EV traders, the market is flooded with various EV models, features, and looks, and customers have options to select according to their needs. They said that EVs ranging from Rs4 million to Rs5.5 million have a large customer base, while high-priced EVs are also seeing good sales.EV traders said that despite the market slowdown, the EV sector has not been affected.“One interesting emerging trend is that people who already own conventional combustion vehicles are also buying EVs,” said Golchha. \nOn May 28, presenting the financial plan for the upcoming fiscal year, Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun said all the 77 districts of the country are now connected by the national road network.But the ground reality is different.Without a bridge over the Karnali river at Chuwa Khola of Kharpunath rural municipality, Simkot, the district headquarters of Humla, remains to be connected to the national road network. Villagers in the northwestern corner of Nepal bordering Tibet in China where the Humla Karnali crosses face hardships in the absence of one bridge.Though the track was opened to Simkot in mid-April, the construction of the bridge has yet to be completed. As a result, a 12 km section still needs to be completed to connect the district headquarters.Now, vehicles carrying goods along the Karnali Corridor can only reach Kharpu. From there, the goods have to be transported by helicopters and carried over the river using cables, resulting in additional costs. This method, however, is possible only when the water level is low. Due to the lack of a bridge, around ten vehicles bought for government offices and passenger service via Surkhet were taken across the river using ropes and a bulldozer. The cars are now operating on the Simkot side.In 2007-08, the government announced in the annual budget that it would connect Simkot to the national road network. However, even after a decade and a half, Simkot is not connected to the national road network.In September 2021, the joint venture of Swachchhanda, Mount, and Pumori was awarded the Rs110 million contract for the bridge. The construction companies were issued Rs11 million in advance, and the project completion deadline was fixed in March this year.However, the company did not start the construction work for a long time, and around a year ago, it was necessary to change the design.“The joint venture company was responsible for constructing a 55-metre-long motorable truss bridge. But when the contractor started to dig the foundation, a hot water spring was found,” said Bel Bahadur Nepali, chief of the Simikot-Hilsa Road Construction Project. “The assessment showed that the bridge will not be durable if it is constructed on the existing design. So, we made the new design, which got approved two weeks ago. We will start the bridge construction work in July.”Nepali said that with the change in design, the contractor has been given a new deadline to complete the project: August 2025.Binod Kumar Pokharel, chief district officer, said the locals have demanded a Bailey or portable bridge as it may take time to complete the project. “Due to the lack of a bridge, the travellers are facing hassles. The passenger and goods transport charges too are high.”Pokharel said the river's flow is high throughout the year, so vehicles must be towed across the river with the help of an earthmover to Simkot. “To solve the problem, the locals have demanded a Bailey bridge. We are assessing the need.”Until last year, vehicles were operated from Khulalu of Kalikot towards Mugu-Bajura-Sillisalla of Humla. Nepali said that the 39 km road track was opened this year. This year, a 39-kilometre stretch was added. The project opened 8 km of the total track, and the Nepal Army did the work on the remaining 9 km section. The road from Khulalu of Kalikot to the Chinese border is 268 km long. Of this, 95 km south of Simkot is served by transportation. However, as the vehicle flow is breached by the lack of a bridge, passengers from Simkot to Khapunath rural municipality must change the vehicle by crossing suspension bridges on foot.Dan Bahadur Shahi, a senior citizen, said since there is no bridge, vehicles are charging higher fares. Jeeps run on the 12km Simkot-Kharpu stretch. The vehicle operators charge Rs700 to Rs1,000 per person as fare for a special arrangement called “reserve”. In similar fashion, the jeep operated from Kharpu via Sillisalli to Surkhet charges Rs7,000 per person, he said.“We are compelled to change the vehicle as there is no bridge. While crossing the river using the suspension bridge, we need to pay wages to a porter,” Shahi said. “If there were a bridge, we would be able to reach Surkhet by a single vehicle, and the fare would be less.”The price of daily consumable goods in Simkot is sky high, too. “No goods-carriers operate here; small jeeps are permitted to carry passengers only. This means we have to transport goods using porters so the prices refuse to come down,” said Bhim Bahadur Rokaya, a trader at Simkot.“There is no chance of prices falling unless a bridge is constructed across the Kharpu river, allowing for goods to be ferried by trucks,” Rokaya said.Pokharel said that because route permits are issued only from Khulalu of Kalikot to Sillisalli, fares are not fixed. “We have directed the Transport Management Office, Jumla, to manage the route permit and fare. The decision will be taken soon by a meeting of the transportation management committee.” \nKP Sharma Oli has pulled out yet another rabbit from his old bag of tricks. Barely four months after extending support to Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s leadership of the government, CPN-UML, the second largest party in Parliament, has decided to end its political association with Dahal and join hands with Nepali Congress, the largest party. Saturday’s apparently sudden meeting between Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba and CPN-UML chair KP Oli at the latter’s residence laid the ground for a potential new political alliance between the two parties.Multiple senior Congress and UML leaders told the Post that Deuba and Oli had already reached an understanding in a meeting on Sunday midnight at an undisclosed location in Kathmandu, where they tentatively agreed to form a new government, amend the constitution, and to work out a power-sharing formula, which they reportedly shared with a few confidants. As per the understanding between Congress and UML, Oli will lead a new ‘national consensus’ government for a year and a half. For the remaining term, Deuba will be the prime minister, a Nepali Congress leader who is preparing a draft agreement between the two parties told the Post on Monday night. A four-member task force has prepared the draft agreement, which will be released on Tuesday. It will detail the power-sharing arrangement, propose amendments to the constitution, review the electoral system including proportional representation, change national assembly arrangements, and discuss size of provincial assemblies, according to a taskforce member. Ramesh Lekhak and Gyanendra Bahadur Karki from the Congress and Shankar Pokhrel and Ramesh Badal from the UML had held several rounds of talks in the past two weeks, said a UML leader. If everything goes according to plan, a deal will be public by Tuesday, and chairman Oli will stake claim to the post of prime minister on Tuesday itself, a UML minister said. Two Congress leaders familiar with the meeting as per the understanding between Oli and Deuba, Oli will lead the new government with the support of Nepali Congress and other fringe parties. The Congress will lead 10 ministries including home, and the UML nine including finance, as per the draft understanding. Likewise, the Congress and the UML will lead three provincial governments each, with the government in Madhesh to be led by a regional party. There has also been a verbal agreement on formation of a high-powered constitution review and suggestions committee under a former chief justice of the Supreme Court. Deuba and Oli had reportedly been in talks over the past one month in order to address some pressing national issues, and have agreed to amend the constitution where needed. They are also said to have reached understandings on foreign policy, economic crisis, and governance.One big issue that is said to have caused a rift between Prime Minister Dahal and Oli was over the appointment of the chairman of the Securities Board of Nepal or Sebon. The appointment process was ultimately cancelled on Saturday due to differences between the two leaders.Sources inside the Finance Ministry said the selection process became the victim of the political power play between the UML and the Maoist Centre, leading to the cancellation of the entire process.But after a meeting between the two on Monday morning, a Cabinet meeting later in the day decided to give continuity to the old three-member committee to nominate candidates for Sebon chair.Some media reports tried to link the latest Deuba-Oli meeting with yet another development, as it took place a day after Nepal Police arrested Bechan Jha, one of the alleged middlemen in the high-profile Bhutanese refugee scam.Police last year filed cases against politicians, bureaucrats and middlemen on charges of defrauding hundreds of people by promising to send them to the US as Bhutanese refugees. But police were not able to book Jha despite his connection with the scam.Jha is allegedly close to many political leaders, including senior Congress leaders, and the Congress leadership might have been worried that they too could be dragged into the refugee scam.Differences between Oli and Dahal had been steadily building, including over the new Sebon chair, the appointment of ambassadors to eight countries, transitional justice, and the bringing of what Oli termed a ‘Maoist budget’ for the new fiscal year. During their meeting on Monday morning, Oli reportedly requested Dahal to support him by stepping down. “I had serious discussions with Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba on the formation of a new government in order to make some changes to the constitution and to address some pressing national issues,” a UML leader quoted Oli as telling him. According to the UML leader, Dahal offered Oli the post of prime minister within the current ruling coalition, but Oli politely turned down the offer. The UML chair instead expressed his desire to lead a consensus government, the UML leader told the Post.Deuba and Oli were in talks for a month through different channels. After several rounds of back-channel talks and negotiations between the second-ranking leaders of the Nepali Congress and UML, they finally agreed to meet.According to the two UML leaders who were briefed about the latest situation, time has come to form a government based on national consensus in order to address the country’s daunting challenges.Prime Minister Dahal had called a meeting of ruling partners for 5:00 pm on Monday, but the meeting had to be postponed in light of the new situation. Dahal, who was all set to reshuffle the Cabinet, was planning to discuss the same in the meeting.   \nIt has been 20 years since the 2005 Hong Kong Ministerial Meeting recognised that developing and, mainly, least developed countries (LDCs) cannot meaningfully participate in the global trading system as envisaged while establishing the World Trade Organization (WTO) without “some kind of support” to enhance their trade capacity. This gave birth to the idea of Aid for Trade (AfT). The WTO claims that AfT is particularly helpful to the LDCs, which “face a range of supply-side and trade-related infrastructure obstacles which constrain their ability to engage in international trade.” In theory, it mobilises resources to address the trade-related constraints identified by these countries.According to WTO data, $556 billion in AfT was disbursed between 2006 and 2020. AfP’s priority and focus naturally shift with the tide of time. Initially, it focused more on improving trade logistics and enabling small businesses to trade their generally uncompetitive products, wishfully, in developed countries. Now, the weight of the discourse seems to be inclined to climate change issues arising in every knot of the supply chain, the scope of gender equity in sharing trade benefits, and the digital divide as an additional constraint to LDCs when the global trade in both goods and services is being rapidly digitised.Key questionsHas the AfT really helped developing and least-developed countries build their trade capacities and provided the much-needed market share for their goods (and services) in developed countries? The WTO leadership claims that trade (solely?) lifted 1.5 billion people out of abject poverty. It appears as if the global population’s poverty reduction is only because of increased cross-border trade and all the official development assistance received by any poverty-stricken country meant only for trade. Nevertheless, the amount in aggregate disbursement under AfT looks impressive. When it comes to the annual average, it is less than $40 billion a year; when divided among the 137 developing out of 217 economies, the dole out is mere symbolism and not enough to undertake even a single medium-sized project. Forty-five countries are still categorised as LDCs, and 32 are small, landlocked economies like Nepal. When viewed through the challenges faced in accessing trade passage through another sovereign territory, the correlation between their LDC status and landlockedness can’t just be coincidental.For instance, according to the Creditor Reporting System of OECD, Nepal received over $300 million as AfT until 2019. The Enhanced Integrated Framework under the WTO supported the development of the Nepal Trade Integration Strategy (NTIS) to identify the goods with import potential and to conduct several studies like the e-readiness of the businesses. Nepal has developed three versions of the NTIS in the last 15 years—in 2010, 2016 and 2023. The country has increased the list of products and services from 19 to thirty-six. But export trade has only nose-dived over this period, not only in terms of export-import ratio but also in nominal value.Why have we failed in our trade capacity building so badly, and why couldn't all the financial aid flow in support to this end? More importantly, have these international frameworks and support helped developing and least-developed countries excel in balancing their trade in their favour? More often than not, the answer, sadly, is in the negative. Why are LDCs left behind?The 9th Aid for Trade review took place at the WTO headquarters in Geneva in the last week of June. Sessions like “Trade for All” and “Realizing LDCs’ Trade Potential” were also part of the rituals. The reasons for LDCs’ failures may be aplenty, including their inability to set production and trade priorities, bad governance and political instability. However, in the true sense, they are not supported throughout this process. Instead, these voiceless countries are incessantly derided for not doing enough, being reactive, making negativity a survival tactic, and being angry and critical of the Western developed countries for no reason. The reality is different. These essentially neo-colonial narratives are created to cover up the developed countries’ intentions to extend their trade protectionism. They lecture on the developing and poor countries on the perils of climate change while failing to change their own lifestyle and renunciating their luxuries, even partially. Such annual rituals, even publications, highlight achievements that hardly reflect ground reality in the countries concerned; instead, feigned diplomatic niceties rule the roost.Contentious issues like the possibility of the supply chain being destroyed by the Russia-Ukraine war, the trade wars between the major trade partners in the world, like the US and China and India and China, and their gross violations of global trade rules, are hardly discussed in detail. The discussion on peripheral issues chosen by “experienced” consultants makes it easy to evade truly excruciating issues. Underdeveloped and developing countries are instructed to transform into a green economy. But the governments and citizens of developed countries who are using air conditioners, refrigerators and fossil fuel vehicles on a mammoth scale are not ready to give up their lifestyles. The underdeveloped world, which consumes only a very small part of it, is held guilty. The developed countries have no intention of reducing major carbon emissions, and it looks impossible given their consumption patterns. Seventy percent of the electricity consumed by developed countries comes from coal, diesel and petrol plants. Air travel and cargo shipment are unlikely to be replaced by green energy for the next several decades.There is nothing for least-developed countries to sell in the competitive global trade. They cannot be expected to produce and sell high-quality, refined and high-value-low volume goods. They can sell either agricultural products or primary or secondary raw materials. It can never be a profitable and sustainable trade. Lately, organic products have suddenly become the import priority of developed countries. But have chemical fertilisers and pesticides been explored and diffused by developing countries? The production system of the developing world became dependent on harmful fertilisers and pesticides produced and aggressively traded by the developed countries. How, then, will these agriculture-based economies trade with new phyto-sanitation and other rules?Worst of all, the West has monopolised the knowledge products, knowledge systems and discourses related to the trade vulnerability of the LDCs. This has created a significant barrier even for a dispassionate debate on it.

While 80 percent of all bylines are male, the presence of marginalised communities, especially Dalits, is nearly non-existent.  \nThe Mandala Alumni Drama Festival showcases six original plays created by alumni, ranging from thought-provoking discourses to satirical comedies, emphasizing youth, roots, and the art of performativity in theater.\nThe Communist Party of Nepal-Unified Marxist-Leninist (CPN-UML) demands PM Pushpa Kamal Dahal's resignation while Congress president KP Oli eyes premiership with Nepali Congress (NC) support, as Dahal's coalition government faces a confidence vote on July 12 due to the withdrawal of support from CPN-UML and Janata Samajbadi Party.\nNepal's Nepali Congress supports forming a new government led by KP Oli under Article 76 (2) of the constitution, following a deal with UML despite opposition from some party members and Prime Minister Dahal.\nThe Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML on Monday night inked a deal to form a new ruling alliance by ousting the current Pushpa Kamal Dahal government while also agreeing to amend the Constitution of Nepal promulgated just nine years ago.Though the country’s two largest parties are yet to make the details of the deal public, their leaders claim they have unanimously agreed to revise some constitutional provisions, mainly related to the electoral system. The ruling CPN (Maoist Centre) has come out strongly against the agreement to revisit the constitution, calling it a regressive move aimed at reviving the 1990 constitution.The Congress and the UML, however, have rubbished the allegations, claiming that their plan to amend the statute is for the country’s good. “The amendment is for stability, which will drive the country on the path of prosperity and development. Some comrades find contextual amendment regressive but I say it is a progressive step,” said Congress chief whip Ramesh Lekhak while addressing a programme on Saturday.The constitution is a living document which can undergo revision to suit the changed context without altering its core values. Different provisions in the statute could be amended but only through a broader consultative and legitimate process, say experts.“The constitution amendment needs proper homework and larger acceptability,” Bipin Adhikari, a professor at the Kathmandu University School of Law, told the Post. “Trying to amend it through an amendment bill registered by the two large parties will only give room for extremist forces to play. A well-thought-out process must be adopted; it cannot be done in a hurry.”He said, first, an expert panel must be constituted to properly study what changes are really required, based on an assessment of the implementation of the constitution in the past nine years. The Congress and the UML need to have an agreement on the content, and then look for national consensus on the issue. “The amendment should be done with a broader objective of strengthening the federal republic.”Some constitutional experts agree that the electoral system needs to be revised for stability. Talking to the Post last month, senior advocate Purna Man Shakya, who also teaches at Nepal Law Campus, said that for greater stability, the electoral system, at least in the provinces, needs to be changed. However, unlike the Congress and the UML, who want changes in both tiers of government, Shakya said, “The new system can be adopted at the federal level if it first succeeds in ensuring stability at the provincial level.”But not everyone agrees that adopting a full first-past-the-post system for the House of Representatives, as many in the Congress and the UML seem to contemplate, will ensure stability. They rather claim that it has been proven wrong on different occasions in the past. “We have evidence that the FPTP alone doesn’t ensure stability. The Congress won the majority in 1959, 1991 and 1999. Was the country stable then?” questions Tula Narayan Shah, a political analyst. He calls the claim of stability through constitutional amendments dishonest, which, he alleges, is being thought of with the intent of establishing the Khas-Arya domination in the House.The group had 70 percent representation in Parliament until the proportional representation system was adopted, after which it fell to 35 percent in the first and the second Constituent Assembly, at a time when only 40 percent of lawmakers were elected directly, according to Shah.“This is why the FPTP’s proportion was increased to 60 percent in the 2015 constitution, which increased the Khas-Arya share to 55 percent,” he said. “A fully FPTP system will allow this community to maintain a hegemony in Parliament.”Stating that class, power connections, caste and gender are the four dominant factors to win direct elections, the minority groups will be sidelined if the proportional representation system is eliminated, Shah added.The mixed electoral system was adopted after the people’s movement of 2006, after a realisation that only a proportional system can ensure the representation of the marginalised and minority communities. The Maoist Centre and the Madhesh-based forces had pushed for it.Senior Advocate Adhikari, who also is a constitutional expert, said the constitution should not be amended without the Maoist Centre and the Madhes-based parties on board.In the view of some experts, the constitution can be amended broadly on five issues. First, provincial boundaries can be redrawn. A separate Madhesh Province was created but the grievances of the Tharu community were neglected. This can be addressed. Second, revision in the electoral system is possible but without killing the spirit of inclusion and representation.Similarly, different constitutional commissions have failed to perform effectively in the absence of proper coordination and with duplication of jurisdiction. That can be adjusted through amendments in the statute. Also, implementation of the fundamental rights are subject to making law now. That needs to be corrected, making sure they are implemented with an immediate effect. Also, there should be delineation of electoral constituencies based on population while also taking the geographical area into consideration, according to the experts.“Rigorous homework and proper justification are needed for the amendment,” said Adhikari. “For broad legitimacy, the parties, after listing out the necessary amendments, can take them to the people at the next general elections.” \nIn the normal course of things, the parliamentary hearing of election commissioner nominee Krishna Man Pradhan would have been completed on Friday. The Parliamentary Hearing Committee would have approved his nomination for the constitutional body, paving the way for his appointment by the President.However, the House committee on Thursday decided to postpone his hearing indefinitely after listening to a complainant, who filed objections against Pradhan’s nomination, accusing him of sexual exploitation. The victim has accused Pradhan of sexually exploiting her for five continuous years until last year.The woman who had lodged a complaint against Pradhan had settled the case out of court after the latter paid Rs10 million in compensation. Appearing before the committee, the victim—in her 30s—said she had to compromise as Pradhan had assured her a well-paying job.“I reluctantly accepted his demand as I desperately needed a job,” the woman told the House committee, according to one of its members. The victim said she agreed to settle the case for money given her dire economic condition. She has also handed over an audio recording as proof of her exploitation by Pradhan.“I filed the complaint to stop such a morally corrupt person from taking the constitutional position. How can you approve his nomination?” she questioned the lawmakers on the committee.Talking to journalists after listening to the victim, Pashupati Shumsher Rana, who chaired the meeting, said they needed to study the matter seriously, as endorsing a candidate for a dignified constitutional position like an election commissioner is a serious responsibility. Committee members said they wanted more time for additional hearings as they want to make the right decision. Ishwari Neupane, a member of the committee, the evidence provided by the complainant is being studied. “We are aware that only a person with high moral integrity can hold the constitutional position. At the same time, we also need to ensure that we don’t do injustice to the nominee. We, therefore, are studying the matter closely,” she told the Post.A two-thirds majority of the 15-strong committee, which has lawmakers from both the chambers of Parliament, can reject the nomination. A member of the committee said a wrong decision of the Constitutional Council has left them in a dilemma. A meeting of the constitutional council recommended Pradhan for the vacant post of election commissioner.“It is the council's responsibility to nominate the right candidates for such important posts,” said the lawmaker. “We don't want to endorse a controversial nominee. But we are not sure if we can do that as Pradhan was picked by the heads of three state organs and the chief of the country’s largest party.”The council headed by Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who also is the CPN (Maoist Centre) chair, had unanimously nominated him. Speaker Devraj Ghimire, National Assembly chair Narayan Dahal, Chief Justice Bishowambhar Prasad Shrestha and deputy Speaker Indira Rana too approved the nomination without question. Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba too gave his stamp of approval. Legal experts say wrong recommendations by the constitutional council automatically raise questions about the intent and capability of its chair and members. “The council cannot make recommendations haphazardly. It must properly check the background of the candidate before nomination,” Raju Prasad Chapagain, former chair of the Constitutional Lawyers’ Forum, told the Post. Legal experts say the Constitutional Council Act clearly states that the nominees for the constitutional positions must be qualified, appropriate for the particular position and hold high moral ground. “It is the responsibility of the members of the council to carry out proper vetting of the nominees. As other members have political background, the chief justice has a major role in vetting. But [Chief Justice] Shrestha failed in this case,” said a constitutional lawyer. He said Pradhan’s bad deeds were no secret in the legal fraternity.“The council fully overlooked Pradhan’s tainted past. There must be some interest at play,” the lawyer further said. Pradhan is the executive director of the Nepal Law Society. An expert on electoral reforms and governance, Pradhan has been in the position since 2000. He reportedly has good rapport with political and judicial leadership. \nKathmandu Metropolitan City intensifies mosquito larvae destruction drive to mitigate dengue virus spread during monsoon season.\nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City has imparted mental health screening training to doctors and paramedics serving at urban health promotion centres.Officials at the Health Department in the metropolis hope that the move will help hundreds of patients with mental health issues in the city to get timely treatment.“Getting free treatment for mental health problems comes under the right to get free basic health care services,” said Sajina Maharjan, acting head of the department. “Mental health problem screening training to doctors and paramedics will help in the timely diagnosis of the problems and start of early treatment.”At least 32 doctors serving at the urban health promotion centres under the city office and dozens of paramedics participated in five-day screening training. The metropolis has upgraded its urban health clinics to urban health promotion centres and started providing services through medical doctors. “Due to the lack of doctors at our urban health promotion centres, patients suffering from mental health problems have been deprived of timely treatment,” said Nali Bajracharya, a senior public health officer at the department. “Now patients having mental health issues and seeking care at our health centres will also get mental health treatment.”Though neither the federal government agency nor the city office has data on the number of people suffering from mental health problems in the metropolis, doctors estimated that a lot of people could be suffering from various forms of mental health problems—anxiety, depression and others.Officials say that they are also planning to provide free medication to patients with mental health problems.Health workers say that many city dwellers, despite having mental health problems, do not seek treatment and instead turn to drugs and substances to cope. Due to the entrenched social stigma, fear of discrimination and other factors, many patients in Nepal do not talk about their mental health issues.The general tendency among people to conceal mental health issues due to the stigma attached to it has also forced patients to opt for substance abuse, doctors say.They say that while drugs and alcohol may provide temporary relief from stress, they are not a solution and can adversely affect mental health and well-being in the long run.“Treatment in the initial stage of mental illness helps patients achieve better results. For that, early diagnosis is crucial,” said Dr Pomawati Thapa, chief of the Non-communicable Disease and Mental Health Section at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Other local units should also follow the initiative to provide mental health screening training to health workers, including doctors.”Nepal is among the countries with highest rates of suicide, which is an extreme manifestation of a mental health problem.According to Nepal Police data, 6,993 people took their own lives in the fiscal year 2022-2023. This accounts for more than 19 deaths on average daily. Fifty-six percent of those who die by suicide are men.Doctors say that people do not attempt suicide for a single reason, but due to a complex situation arising from multiple problems.An increasing number of people are struggling with mental problems owing to the rising cost of living and the struggle to manage even their most basic needs, such as food, housing, healthcare and jobs, experts say.Whatever the cause, suicides and suicide attempts have a ripple effect, impacting families, friends, colleagues, communities and societies, doctors say.A study carried out by the Nepal Health Research Council in the past shows that about 13 percent of Nepalis suffer from some form of mental disorder. This means around one in eight Nepalis has mental health issues. Moreover, the country simply does not have enough experts to treat mental health problems, it added.Studies show the magnitude of suffering, the burden and costs for individuals, families and societies arising from mental health disorders are alarming in Nepal.“No doubt, mental health problems have been emerging as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in our country,” said Thapa. “All local governments must take initiative to address the problems. Only the federal government agencies cannot do much.”The World Health Organisation says that one in four people in the world has been affected by mental or neurological disorders at some point in their lives, and around 450 million people currently suffer from such conditions, placing mental disorders among the leading causes of ill health and disability worldwide. \nDuring the 2022 local level election, people of Kathmandu elected independent candidate Balendra Shah as their mayor for five years. Sunita Dangol of the CPN-UML secured the position of KMC deputy mayor in the same election. When they began their term, many suspected that the two—an independent mayor and his party-affiliated deputy—wouldn’t have cordial relations. But, in the last two years of their term, there has been no visible disagreement between them. They proved their sceptics wrong.Deputy Mayor Dangol kept mum when Mayor Shah accused her party chair, KP Sharma Oli, of policy corruption in the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate land scam.Moreover, Shah expressed his anger on June 3 over the government’s intervention in his plan to widen pavements in the New Road area. Deputy Prime Minister Raghubir Mahaseth of the UML leads the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, which maintains major roads.After the ministry intervened in the municipal plan to expand the sidewalk on New Road, Shah took to social media and wrote, “Honourable KP Oli jyu, don’t hoodwink people by engineering yet another scam to hide a scam of Rs10,000 crore [Rs100 billion].”He further added, “You have reassured those who had made advance payments to buy land of Giri Bandhu Tea Estate that they would get the land within two years.” “If one looks at the policy corruption in the tea estate, it appears not a single leaf would stir without Oli’s nod,” Shah wrote.A few days prior to the incident, Mayor Shah had engaged in a heated debate with Chinkaji Maharjan, a UML member and chairman of KMC’s ward 22, over the sidewalk expansion plan.Dangol remained quiet on the issue thus far. However, at the city council meeting on Monday, which also discussed KMC's policies and programmes for the fiscal year 2024-25, she criticised Mayor Shah for his remarks.“This should be the first time the deputy mayor opposed the public behavior and statement of the mayor,” a Kathmandu ward chairperson told the Post on the condition of anonymity.Dangol had her initial plan to contest the mayor position independently but the UML gave her the deputy mayor’s ticket.Speaking during the Monday discussion, Deputy Mayor Dangol said, addressing Mayor Shah, “Your and mine voices are being heard and watched by Nepalis worldwide. Therefore, those of us who want to come to politics should think about our expression,” Dangol remarked. “We should maintain the image and dignity of the institution we represent.”She also emphasised the need to accommodate the voices of everyone in an undertaking.Though the representatives of Kathmandu Metropolitan City claim that Dangol's Monday statement was unusual, they deny any rift between the two leaders of the local government. “City council’s is an internal meeting of the KMC where various issues arise. We settle those issues internally,” Nabin Manandhar, the KMC spokesperson and ward 17 chairman from the Nepali Congress, told the Post. “Having an opinion does not necessarily mean criticism.”Rajesh Kumar Shrestha, chair of KMC ward 19, seconded Manandhar.However, local representatives of Kathmandu have been questioning Shah for his ‘lone-wolf’ manner of leading the institution.“We should develop a working relationship that welcomes everyone’s spirit,” Dangol told the council meeting. “If one thinks they are in a position and everything should be done as they say, it will only lead to trouble.”She added, “While working in a team, we definitely have a different opinion, but different opinions should be respected.”At the meeting, referring to Mayor Shah's past statements, council member Anita Karki asked him, saying, “What if the voters of Kathmandu set ablaze the Durbar where the KMC office lies?”In September last year, when the traffic police obstructed a KMC vehicle, later known to be used by his postpartum wife, Mayor Shah provocatively wrote on Facebook, threatening to burn Singha Durbar, the federal government’s central secretariat.Traffic police, under the federal government, had stopped the vehicle to check necessary documents on a Saturday.After the incident, Shah wrote on social media warning that if the government blocked KMC's vehicles again, he would set fire to Singha Durbar.Dangol said on Monday that she believed it was wrong to write on social media or make a statement inciting people to burn the Singha Durbar or the Bagh Durbar, where the KMC office is situated.Dangol, speaking at the city council meeting, also said there should be no polarisation between the representatives who were elected to develop Kathmandu. \nA police officer was found dead on the premises of the federal parliament building in Baneshwar, Kathmandu on Wednesday.According to Ekram Giri, spokesperson for the federal parliament secretariat, Ajit Gole of Dolakha committed suicide by shooting himself.The body of the victim was recovered from the parliament building’s washroom.Dinesh Mainali, spokesperson for the Kathmandu Metro Police Range, said Gole, who was on duty from 6am to 10am, was found dead at around 8 in the morning. “A constable of Nepal Police was found dead inside a toilet of the parliament building,” Mainali told the Post. “Preliminary investigation shows he was inflicted with a gunshot.”Nepal police said the investigation is underway. \nPolice on Friday arrested two people from Thimi of Bhaktapur for allegedly mining cryptocurrency.The Central Investigation Bureau took 50-year-old Biswas Gurung and Rajendra Tahamata, 25, into custody in connection with the crime, said Hobindra Bogati, spokesperson for the bureau.The duo allegedly ran mining operations from the CTEVT’s information technology lab using a server and 64 desktops, on which blockchain applications were found during a preliminary investigation. Further investigation into the matter is underway. \nThe vegetable supply chain to Kathmandu Valley has been disrupted by the inundation of large areas of standing crops in the current wave of floods and landslides across the country, pushing prices to new highs in the last two days.The torrential rains, which started on Friday, have killed 14 people and affected thousands of households, according to the authorities. Most of the highways have been affected by landslides. A vast swathe of agricultural land has been inundated.According to the Kalimati Fruits and Vegetable Market Development Board, tomatoes, potatoes, cabbage, cauliflower, eggplant, cow pea (long), French bean, soybean green, bitter gourd, bottle gourd, pointed gourd, snake gourd, smooth gourd, squash, okra, and leafy vegetables are currently among the most expensive kitchen ingredients in the Valley.Traders say the prices, which were already expensive, increased overnight.Retail prices of most vegetables have crossed Rs100 per kg within two days, said Shanta Adhikari, owner of Shanta Tarkari Pasal in Balkot. “I was buying tomatoes for Rs1,000 per crate (23 kg) till Friday. Today [Sunday], the price nearly doubled to Rs1,900 per crate.”Adhikari said the tomato retail price was hovering around Rs70–75 per kg until Friday and has now reached Rs100 per kg. As the Bhaktapur area has been flooded and inundated, the price of leafy vegetables has reached Rs100 per kg, from Rs70 per kg three days ago.The wholesale price of tomato big (Nepali) at the Kalimati market, the country’s largest fruits and vegetable wholesale venue, has increased by 26.67 percent to Rs95 per kg. Similarly, the price of tomatoes (local) has increased by 211.26 percent to Rs55 per kg, while the price of tomato small (tunnel) has risen by 186.72 percent to Rs65 per kg.Traders at Kalimati said that the wholesale price of all seasonal vegetables has risen as the rainfall has inundated crop fields and affected road transport.Adhikari said French beans, which she sold at Rs60-80 per kg on Friday, now cost Rs100 per kg. Similarly, smooth gourd, which she sold at Rs70-75 per kg, now costs Rs100, and cauliflower has reached Rs120 per kg. Capsicum, too, has become expensive. It costs Rs140 per kg.“Even the eggplant, which cost Rs50 per kg, has hit Rs80-85 per kg,” she said.The wholesale price of all three varieties of potatoes—red, Indian, and Mude—at the Kalimati market has increased within a week. The price of potato red has increased by 2.18 percent to Rs62.33 per kg, potato red (India) by 10.32 percent to Rs57 per kg, and potato red (Mude) by 3.92 percent to Rs53 per kg.The wholesale price of cabbage has sharply increased by 62.63 percent to Rs45 per kg, eggplant long by 57.14 percent to Rs55 per kg, and eggplant round by 36.36 percent to Rs75 per kg.The long cowpea price has increased by 44.44 percent to Rs65 per kg, the French bean by 76.92 percent to Rs115 per kg, and the French bean (rajma) by 27.27 percent to Rs140 per kg in wholesale.Seasonal soybean green wholesale price has increased by 26.32 percent to Rs120 per kg.The wholesale price of bitter gourd has sharply increased by 111.11 percent to Rs95 per kg, while the price of bottle gourd has risen by 66.67 percent to Rs75 per kg.The wholesale price of pointed gourds has increased by 28.57 percent to Rs45 per kg, snake gourds by 22.22 percent to Rs55 per kg, and smooth gourds by 36.36 percent to Rs75 per kg.The wholesale price of squash has increased by 36.36 percent to Rs75 per kg, and the price of okra has also gone up by 36.36 percent to Rs75 per kg.Seasonal cucumber (local) wholesale price has increased by 68.42 percent to Rs160 per kg.“The constant rainfall has hit vegetables ready to be shipped to the market. So it is predictable that the prices will go higher in the coming days,” said Binay Shrestha, information officer at the Kalimati Fruits and Vegetable Market Board.Shrestha said the supply of fresh vegetables in Kathmandu has also slowed down. “Our market received 600–650 tonnes of vegetables daily during this time, but we are receiving hardly 500 tonnes now.”Adhikari said she has been selling stale vegetables because she has not received sufficient fresh supplies.Currently, the Kalimati market receives seasonal vegetables from the districts neighbouring Kathmandu Valley such as Makawanpur, Dhading, and Kavre, besides a few districts from the Tarai like Chitwan and Sarlahi.“Despite being kitchen essentials, when prices cross Rs100 per kg, people tend to buy vegetables less,” Adhikari said. “As a result, business in the shops and market also slows down.” \nRakura has launched its next generation of tea products. The company has introduced its revolutionary Magic Knot Teabags, using the world’s first state-of-the-art Tandem Air-knotted technology.Featuring the latest non-heat sealed, double-chambered teabag design, the teabag boasts of being amongst the world’s first and Nepal’s only fully plastic and glue-free teabag. The magic knot teabag also includes new innovations such as the world’s first certified organic, unbleached thread—assuring non-GMO cotton and no harmful chemicals, together with the updated easy-hold tags that are more comfortable to hold and are made of food-grade board and ink, the company said in a statement. The company has also created 21 new varieties of teas while also improving its existing teas and blends, achieving a tea collection that is amongst the biggest in the world. “Given our history of always breaking new ground for the Nepalese tea industry, we’ve again initiated a new era for Nepal’s tea,” said Neeraj Rathi, managing director of Rakura. “We’re calling our next-generation products the most healthful and eco-friendly in the world because there is no other tea product in the world that has all of our innovations in a single pack.” \nFour hundred twenty-one climbing permits were issued for fee-paying individuals during the 2024 Everest season, which ended on May 29. Around 600 people, including 200 foreigners, completed the perilous ascent. Nearly 2,000 people assembled at the base camp. Eight died. These people brought 100 tonnes of waste. Looking ahead to 2025, the world’s tallest peak could have new rules, tighter restrictions and higher fees.Tourism Minister Hit Bahadur Tamang told the National Assembly on Thursday that the ministry has tabled a draft of a new Mountaineering Regulations at the Cabinet, to address the current challenges and evolving context. The Post could not independently verify whether the new regulations will take effect from the beginning of the new fiscal year (July 16). Although the current Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led coalition government has fallen into minority following the withdrawal of support by its largest partner, officials say a change in government is unlikely to affect the mountaineering policy.Rakesh Gurung, director of the mountaineering section of the Tourism Department, said that starting in the spring of 2025, a climbing permit for Everest will cost $15,000. Currently, the permit to climb the 8,848.86-metre Himalayan giant costs $11,000 for foreigners and Rs75,000 for Nepalis. The last time the government reviewed the royalty fee was on January 1, 2015. At that time, an expedition with a maximum of 15 members cost $10,000 per person.The cost has now been revised for autumn and winter, as well as the climbing routes. As per the draft, in 2025, Nepal will introduce death repatriation insurance for climbers for the first time.“We have set a minimum coverage of Rs5 million ($37,593) for repatriating bodies under the insurance plan, which will be mandatory,” said Gurung. “The insurance should be done in Nepal.”He said expedition agencies would be responsible for retrieving bodies from the base camp and upper reaches.The draft regulations propose increasing the insurance coverage paid by climbers for their high-altitude guides to Rs2 million ($15,037) from the existing Rs1.5 million ($11,278). Additionally, the regulations mandate that every climber, no matter how experienced, must be accompanied by a Nepali guide.“We have proposed a ban on alpine-style or solo climbing,” said Gurung.Before preparing the new regulations, the Law Ministry debated the issue, as it was concerned that banning solo climbing could restrict the personal freedom of alpinists. “But we presented our arguments on why banning solo climbing is crucial for saving lives,” said Gurung. “The law ministry was finally convinced.” Among eight deaths on Everest this year, five were preventable, said Gurung.The Mongolian duo—Tsedendamba Usukhjargal and Lkhagvajav Purevsuren—who were both experienced mountaineers and members of the Hunnu hiking club—climbed Everest without supplemental oxygen and Sherpa guides. They went missing on May 13 and were found dead on May 17.On May 22, Binod Babu Bastakoti, a Nepali national, died near the South Col while descending from the summit. It was later found that he decided to hire a guide only at Camp II when he started facing difficulties.As in previous years, this year too, a group of foreign climbers were reportedly found climbing the higher reaches without obtaining a permit from the government.The new regulations propose introducing “Monitoring Rangers” on Everest from next season, comprising officials from the Nepal Army, Nepal Police, Armed Police Force, and various ministries and government bodies.“This unit will be authorised to monitor every activity on Everest and go up to the higher reaches for investigation,” said Gurung.According to the Himalayan Database, which records all expeditions and deaths in the Himalayas, there have been more than 200 deaths on the Nepal side of Everest between 1953, when Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay Sherpa first scaled the peak, and 2022.Nepal’s tourism ministry started documenting Everest incidents in 1922 when seven Sherpa climbers died in an avalanche, marking the first reported deaths on the tallest mountain. But it has no archive of those who lost their lives on the icy slopes.Separately, the tourism department has proposed a garbage management fund—to be raised from each climber, which will be used to clean up Everest.“We have proposed that the fund provision be included in the Tourism Act, which is currently in the drafting phase,” said Gurung, adding that this provision, however, is not part of the new regulations.With more and more people visiting each year, Everest has grown increasingly polluted. This has led to the contamination of the local watershed, threatening the health of local people.The slopes are littered with discarded empty oxygen canisters, abandoned tents, food containers, and even human faeces. The base camp has tented toilets with large collection barrels that can be carried away and emptied. Hundreds of gas and electric heaters and stoves are used at the base camp to cook food and keep warm, thus contributing to the warming of the area.Climate change is melting snow and ice, exposing even more garbage and bodies that have been covered for decades. All that waste pollutes the natural environment and poses a serious health risk to everyone who lives in the Everest watershed.Nearly 100 tonnes of garbage were collected during this spring climbing season from Everest and Lhotse, which share the same base camp.According to the Sagarmatha Pollution Control Committee (SPCC), 77.19 tonnes of waste was collected from the Everest base camp alone during the Spring 2024 climbing season. With 8-9 tonnes coming from the higher camps brought by the expedition agencies, the SPCC collected 85 tonnes of waste this spring.The breakdown of collected waste shows burnable garbage at 27.99 tonnes, recyclable garbage at 7.51 tonnes, human waste at 27.53 tonnes, and kitchen waste at 14.15 tonnes. Besides, the Nepal Army collected over 11 tonnes of garbage.In the Spring of 2023, the SPCC managed nearly 70 tonnes of waste generated by expedition groups. Since 2015, the SPCC has also enforced the 8 kg garbage rule, under which every climber ascending the Everest base camp must bring back at least 8 kg of garbage. Anyone visiting Everest must pay a $4,000 garbage deposit, which is refunded if the person returns with 8 kg.Before the start of the climbing season this year, the Supreme Court issued a mandamus order directing the government to regulate the rising number of expeditions on the world’s tallest mountain.A division bench of justices Sapana Pradhan Malla and Sushma Lata Mathema ordered the government to issue climbing permits only after specifying the number of climbers that can be safely accommodated.The court order followed increasing traffic jams on the world’s highest peak and the trash people leave on its slopes. Everest has even been called the ‘world's highest garbage dump’.This spring, the government implemented a slew of new rules in the Himalayas, including mandatory use of tracking devices and poo bags while summiting the peak.Jagat Prasad Bhusal, chief administrative officer of the Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Rural Municipality, told the Post in a recent interview that the rural municipality sold 1,700 poo bags. “In the first year of its implementation, we have received good feedback and the requirement to bring the bags back.”“We are now discussing Everest's ‘carrying capacity’ as per the Supreme Court order. It’s difficult to ascertain what exactly the limit of Everest is,” said Gurung.In 365 days, Everest opens its climbing window for less than two weeks, depending on the weather.“Hopefully, we will soon have an answer to this query,” said Gurung. \nMalaysia Airlines hosted the largest airline trade event ever held in Malaysia, the first Malaysia Airlines Trade Elevation Summit 2024, in collaboration with Tourism Malaysia and the Malaysia Convention and Exhibition Bureau.This inaugural event brought together 300 delegates, including over 200 international attendees from 48 cities and 21 countries. The summit marked a significant milestone for Malaysia Airlines as it prepares for the VisitMalaysia Year 2026, which aims to position Kuala Lumpur as a gateway for Asia and beyond and establish Malaysia as a true ASEAN tourism and aviation hub. Group Managing Director of Malaysia Aviation Group, the parent company of Malaysia Airlines, Captain Izham Ismail commented, “This summit transcended the typical conference; it celebrated partnerships that embody Malaysia Airlines’ inclusive spirit as we collaborate globally for mutual growth. We eagerly anticipate showcasing Malaysia’s hospitality and advancing tourism objectives through strategic alliances.” \nWith monsoon havoc sweeping across the country, the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division has urged health workers to avoid taking leave during the season.Officials have warned that health facilities could be overwhelmed by patients in the coming days as outbreaks of waterborne and vector-borne diseases are expected, as floodwaters have contaminated most of the drinking water sources.“We have requested the provincial and local health authorities not to grant leave to health workers during the monsoon season,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director of the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Health agencies have been cautioned about the looming risk of outbreaks of waterborne and vector-borne diseases in the coming days.”Torrential rainfall started Friday wreaking havoc in various places across the country. At least 14 people have died in disaster-related incidents—nine in landslides and five in floods—since Friday, according to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority. Officials said 18 others have been injured, and four people are missing. Since the monsoon entered the country on June 10, at least 43 people have died in landslides and flood-related incidents. Lightning strikes killed as many as 19 people during this period.The monsoon season in Nepal is a time of epidemics during which thousands of people across the country become infected with water-borne and vector-borne diseases.The persistent rainfall that started on Friday not only destroyed houses and inundated settlements but also contaminated drinking water sources.Health officials warned that health facilities could witness an uptick in the number of viral fever cases, and waterborne diseases—diarrhoea, dysentery, food poisoning, and snake bites—in the coming days.“We have also requested central hospitals and medical colleges to be prepared for help during disease outbreaks,” said Ghimire. “As we don’t have enough doctors and health workers to deploy to control the outbreaks, we have to seek help from big hospitals and medical colleges.”Officials at the Ministry of Health and Population said that they have been raising awareness through all available means to inform people of the risks. “Essential medicines have been stockpiled, health workers have been asked to be ready for deployment to affected areas, anti-snake venom has been supplied to health facilities,” said Dr Prakash Budhathoki, spokesperson at the Health Ministry. “As of Sunday evening, no outbreaks have been reported.”According to health experts, sources of drinking water generally become contaminated in disaster-hit areas, and people displaced by natural disasters become highly vulnerable to infections with waterborne and vector-borne diseases. Every year, thousands of people get infected with vector-borne diseases such as dengue, kala-azar, malaria, and scrub typhus during this period. Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts. According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,432 people from 73 districts have been infected with the dengue virus since January this year. Among the 73 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases: 159. Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. Likewise, snakebite incidents and resulting deaths are also common during the season, but the phenomenon, which experts dub “a lurking invisible crisis”, remains grossly neglected. “Incidents of snakebites have started to surge over the last few weeks,” said Dr Rajiv Jha, director at Provincial Health Directorate of Madhesh Province. “Along with the surge in waterborne and vector-borne diseases in the coming days, we have anticipated a rise in snakebite cases.”Doctors say the only ways to prevent deaths from waterborne diseases, including diarrhoea, are to raise awareness and ensure safe drinking water.They say a combination of careful surveys, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation and treatment are required to contain the spread of the diarrhoeal infection. \nWith the onset of the rainy season, the incidents of snakebite are on the rise in western Tarai districts.Snakebite treatment centres and hospitals in Kanchanpur and Kailali districts of Sudurpaschim province are now crowded with snakebite patients. Treatment of the snakebite patients, according to health workers, is quite challenging as patients are often brought to the health facilities at the last minute.As many as 60 snakebite patients visited the Snakebite Treatment Centre set up by Nepal Army at Arjuni of Shuklaphanta National Park within the past three weeks. “Over the past one week three to four snakebite patients have been visiting the centre on a daily basis,” said Ratan Bohora, a paramedic at the Arjuni-based Snakebite Treatment Centre. The local residents have hugely benefited after the Nepali Army and the local community jointly established the snakebite treatment centre at Arjuni in 2014. The centre, however, has to refer the patients with serious health conditions to other well facilitated hospitals due to the lack of an intensive care unit (ICU) and ventilator. “Two patients who were bitten by poisonous snakes were referred to Mahakali Provincial Hospital in Mahendranagar this year. We have no alternative but to send serious cases of snakebite to other hospitals due to the lack of the ICU and ventilator facilities,” said Bohora. The centre also does not even have a monitor to track a patient's vital signs such as blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen levels. The flow of the patients is increasing, but the centre only has two paramedics to provide treatment.Incidents of snakebite and resulting deaths are common in Nepal, but the issue still remains grossly neglected as what experts call a lurking ‘invisible crisis’. Each year, around 2,700 people, mostly children and women from Nepal’s Tarai region, die of snakebites, according to a March 2022 report.Most snakebite incidents occur when farmers are transplanting paddy fields or children are playing outdoors. Health workers say that the snakes that live in water are generally less poisonous. “The cases that are most serious occurred at night, often inside houses. Such patients should be taken to hospital immediately,” said Bohora. According to him, people living in thatched-roof houses are especially vulnerable to snakebite, because snakes often enter such homes in search of rats.Nepal is home to around 17 highly venomous snakes. Each year, the country sees about 20,000 to 40,000 cases of snakebite. The numbers could be higher, as many cases of snakebite go unreported, health workers say.Another health challenge in rural Nepal is the superstitious belief in visiting shamans instead of seeking treatment at medical facilities for snakebite. Experts say awareness drives should be launched to educate people that the snakebite patients should be taken to the hospital at the earliest. They recommend promoting cleanliness around homes, preventing children from playing in bushy areas, avoiding nightime walks, and using torchlight while walking in the dark.“Treatment of snakebite patients is possible if they are taken to health facilities on time. Patients are often brought to the hospital only after their condition has worsened, resulting in serious consequences,” said Dr Arjun Bhatta, medical superintendent at Mahakali Provincial Hospital. According to him, 10 snakebite patients with serious health conditions visited the hospital in the past three weeks. “They returned home after treatment,” said Bhatta. \nThe Thapathali-based Paropakar Maternity and Women’s Hospital is going to organise a healthy baby competition next month with an aim to raise awareness about overall baby development. Officials at the hospital said that the competition will not only assess physical growth and health of babies, several expert teams will also evaluate feeding practices, exclusive breastfeeding, immunisation, and the use of family planning methods by parents to ensure proper birth interval.“We would like to request parents of babies born at our hospital in the past year to register their babies for the contest,” said Dr Shree Prasad Adhikari, director at the hospital. “This is also an opportunity for parents to show how their parenting has been yielding positive results.”The hospital administration, however, said that the contest would be open only to babies born at the maternity hospital.Around 24,000 babies are born at the hospital each year, with around 39 percent delivered through the Caesarean section.The hospital administration said the contest will be held on August 13, coinciding with the hospital’s anniversary, and registration will start on July 16. Babies will be assessed in three categories—1 to 45 days, 45 days to six months, and six months to one year.Doctors say that babies' body mass index will be monitored to assess their growth.“We will also evaluate exclusive breastfeeding practices, administration of routine vaccines, and use of family planning methods,” said Adhikari. “We will form several teams of experts to assess the babies and award certificates to the top three babies in each category.”Doctors at the hospital said that the contest would help raise awareness of good parenting, exclusive breastfeeding, healthy feeding habits, the drawbacks of giving junk food to small children, and the importance of using family planning methods to maintain appropriate intervals between births.Studies show that the exclusive breastfeeding rate in Nepal has been steadily declining over the years. According to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022, exclusive breastfeeding has been continuously declining from 70 percent in 2011 to 56 percent in 2021.What concerns health officials is that more educated and well-off mothers are less likely to exclusively breastfeed their babies, as shown by studies.The report said the proportion of children who are bottle-fed rises with increasing education among mothers, ranging from 12 percent among mothers with no formal education to 49 percent among those with more than a secondary education. The use of a bottle with a nipple is the highest in the highest wealth quintile, at 46 percent, and lowest in the poorest quintile, at 11 percent.The proportion of children aged 0–5 months who are exclusively breastfed fluctuates across wealth quintiles. The proportion is highest in the lowest wealth quintile—64 percent—and lowest in the highest quintile—44 percent.The proportion of children who are bottle-fed is higher in urban areas, at 26 percent, than in rural areas, at 15 percent. The use of a bottle with a nipple is lowest in Karnali Province, at 11 percent, and in Madhesh Province, at 12 percent, and the highest in Bagmati Province, at 43 percent.The report also showed that bottle-feeding practices often start in health facilities. It showed that 22 percent of children born in a health facility receive mixed milk feeding (breast milk and fresh, packaged, or powdered animal milk or infant formula), as compared to 12 percent of those born at home. The World Health Organisation, however, does not recommend bottle feeding, stating that the nipple on a feeding bottle is susceptible to contamination and increases the risk of diseases among children.Nepal had committed to increasing the exclusive breastfeeding rate to more than 90 percent by 2030, but the rate declined from 70 percent in 2011 to 66 percent in 2016 and to 56 percent in 2022.The same report also shows that four percent of children received no vaccination between 2016 and 2021. Experts say feeding practices, exclusive breastfeeding, awareness about the importance of routine vaccination, and the use of family planning methods are basic things that determine not only the health of babies but also their future.  \nThe COVAX facility, the United Nations-backed international vaccine-sharing scheme, has been supplying vaccine doses to Nepal for the last three days.Officials said that the vaccine is part of the 1.6 million doses the facility has committed to supply to the country in 2024.“We received 46,000 doses on the first day,” said Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the immunisation section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “Vaccine doses arrived yesterday and today too.”The COVAX-supplied vaccine doses are Pfizer-BioNTech monovalent vaccines, including the children’s vaccine. The monovalent or single component is designed for the Omicron variant XBB.1.5 of SARS-CoV-2.Officials said that the vaccine doses will be administered to the vulnerable groups, including pregnant women, those having compromised immunity, people suffering from chronic diseases and children having compromised immunity.Officials say around 100,000 vaccine doses will be administered to children between five and 11 having compromised immunity, including those suffering from cancer, HIV and other chronic diseases.They said that administration of vaccine doses is likely to start in the last week of July.Last month, Nepal confirmed the spread of the Covid sub-lineages KP.1, KP.2, KP.3, and KP.4 in the country. All the sub-variants are offshoots of the Omicron variant, which is considered responsible for the surge in new Covid cases in the last few months.Hospitals in Kathmandu had reported a surge in serious cases of Covid infection in April. Doctors attending to the infected patients had said that elderly people and those with underlying conditions were getting severe.The COVAX facility supplied millions of doses of various brands of the coronavirus vaccine which were used to inoculate the majority of the country's population.Earlier, the facility used to supply Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent vaccine doses that included a component of the original virus strain as well as a part of the Omicron variant to provide broad protection against Covid.The vaccine is called a bivalent Covid shot as it contains two components—the original virus strain, and Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 sub-variants.Over 12,000 people died and hundreds of thousands were infected in the first, second and third waves of the Covid pandemic in Nepal. \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar. \nThe noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built. Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nUruguay edged Brazil 4-2 in a penalty shootout on Saturday after going down to 10 men in a bruising 0-0 draw at the Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas to march into the semi-finals of the Copa America where they will face Colombia.With Vinicius Jr suspended for Brazil and watching on from the stands, Dorival Jr’s side struggled to create opportunities despite having a man advantage late in the second half when Uruguay's Nahitan Nandez was sent off.In the ensuing shootout, Sergio Rochet saved Brazil’s first penalty from Eder Militao while his teammate Douglas Luiz hit the post to give Uruguay the upper hand.Although keeper Alisson Becker denied Jose Maria Gimenez and Gabriel Martinelli scored to keep Brazil alive, Manuel Ugarte buried the decisive spot kick as Uruguay continued their quest for a record 16th Copa crown.In a bruising encounter with 41 fouls from both teams, players from both sides were involved in physical battles across the pitch.Brazil’s 17-year-old forward Endrick was on the receiving end of brutal challenges as a high-pressing Uruguay refused to give him space to breathe.On one occasion, Raphinha acted out when Endrick was pushed to the ground by Ronald Araujo as the Brazil skipper retaliated in anger by shoving back before the referee stepped in and had a stern word with both players, keeping his cards in his pocket.But Araujo’s night ended early when he was taken off with an injury after the half-hour mark and the match suddenly burst into life moments later when Darwin Nunez missed a close-range header that sailed over the net.Within seconds, Raphinha saw his shot on a counter-attack thwarted by keeper Rochet, Brazil’s best chance of the half.With Uruguay unable to find a way through, coach Marcelo Bielsa made three substitutions by the 67th minute but his plans were thrown into disarray when Nandez saw red for a painful tackle on Rodrygo.Nandez attempted to take the ball off the Brazilian with a studs-up challenge but only ended up catching his ankle, but the Real Madrid winger escaped any serious injury and was able to continue.He was initially given a yellow card but it was upgraded to a red card by the referee following a VAR review.Uruguay will face Colombia in Wednesday’s semi-final in Charlotte, North Carolina, after they thrashed Panama 5-0 earlier on Saturday. \nJames Rodriguez scored one goal and set up two more as Colombia thoroughly dismantled Panama in a 5-0 win at the State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, on Saturday to march into the Copa America semi-finals.“Los Cafeteros” are through to the semi-finals for the third time in four editions and they will face Uruguay, who beat Brazil 4-2 on penalties in Saturday’s other quarter-final.“The most important thing is still to come. We hope to reach the final,I am very happy because we are going through a good moment. Today we played a good game and scored the goals quickly.” said Rodriguez, who was named player of the match.Striker Jhon Cordoba outmuscled his marker to head home from a corner and give Colombia the lead in the eighth minute, before Nestor Lorenzo’s side were awarded a penalty after Panama goalkeeper Orlando Mosquera brought down Jhon Arias.James Rodriguez stepped up to the spot and smashed his effort into the roof of the net in the 15th minute to net his 28th international goal.Panama had a brief spell of possession midway through the first half, with their best chance coming in the 19th minute when Roderick Miller’s header bounced off the post and directly at goalkeeper Camilo Vargas, who displayed great reflexes to swat it away from goal.Colombia weathered the storm and punished their opponents from another set piece in the 41st minute, as Rodriguez played in Luis Diaz with a quick free kick and the Liverpool winger lobbed his shot over Mosquera from the edge of the area.Colombia eased off the throttle in the second half as they looked to control the game and see out the victory, but they were still the better side by far.They scored their fourth goal in the 70th minute after Richard Rios took advantage of some confusion in the Panama ranks in the aftermath of a foul to rifle in a low drive from range, which caught Mosquera unawares.Panama’s frustration appeared to show when defender Jose Cordoba clattered into Santiago Arias just inside the box to gift Colombia a clear penalty in stoppage time, which substitute Miguel Borja scored with the last kick of the match.The win extends Colombia’s unbeaten run to 27 matches, with their last defeat coming in a 1-0 loss to Argentina in February 2022.Colombia will play their semi-final match against Uruguay in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Wednesday.It was their best-ever performance at the Copa America, improving on their group stage exit on their debut in 2016. \nAn own goal by Mert Muldur completed a dramatic comeback for the Netherlands on Saturday as they overcame a tenacious Turkey 2-1 to book a Euro 2024 semi-final meeting with England.Netherlands desperately needed the attacking quality to get them out of trouble and into the last four. The defender bundled the ball into his own net in the 76th minute under pressure from Cody Gakpo as the Dutch bounced back from a poor first-half display to win a bruising clash.Stefan de Vrij had equalised only six minutes earlier after Turkey went into the break 1-0 up from Samet Akaydin’s 35th-minute header.Turkey rode waves of passionate support at the Olympiastadion to put themselves on course for an unlikely semi-final place but, after keeping the Dutch at bay, they finally succumbed to the pressure in the last 20 minutes.France and Spain meet in the other semi-final on Tuesday before the Dutch face England in Dortmund on Wednesday.The only one of the weekend’s quarter-finals to be completed without extra time or penalties was no less drama-filled.The goal came after sustained pressure from Turkey, who had seen off early Dutch dominance, to set up several opportunities, including a succession of corners.Initial enterprise from the Dutch was met with tenacious defence as Turkey giving their opponents little room to play in.It did not help the Dutch cause that attackers Memphis Depay and Gakpo looked flat, prompting coach Ronald Koeman into throwing on pinch hitter Wout Weghorst at the start of the second half.Although the imposing centre forward looked to sew panic among the Turkish defenders, however, it was at the other end that the next opportunities arose.Guler’s 56th-minute free kick was bent expertly around the Dutch wall but struck the outside of the post.Ten minutes later, Dutch keeper Bart Verbruggen got a hand to deny Baris Alper Yilmaz’s stinging shot and Kaan Ayhan missed out on tucking away the rebound as Weghorst cleared.The Dutch kept plugging away and, as Turkey’s defence became more scrambled, they finally made the breakthrough with Depay’s cross finding an unmarked De Vrij to head home in the 70th minute.The siege continued and it was matter of time before the Dutch grabbed a second, bundled in six minutes later as Gakpo pressurised Muldur after a cross by Dumfries.The resultant set piece was initially cleared but fell for teenager Arda Guler to deliver a perfect cross to the back post and Akaydin was first in a queue of three Turkish players to rise and head home.France and Spain meet in the other semi-final on Tuesday before the Dutch face England in Dortmund on Wednesday. \nAfter so many painful 12-yard setbacks, England embraced the shootout on Saturday as they beat Switzerland 5-3 on penalties after a 1-1 draw to reach the semi-finals of Euro2024 and move to within a step of their first overseas final.Trent Alexander-Arnold slammed home the decisive last of a faultless five to send England into their third semi-final in four tournaments after Jordan Pickford had saved from Manuel Akanji.It was the third successive Euro 2024 quarter-final to go to extra time, two of them to penalties, and in the semi-final in Dortmund on Wednesday England will face the Netherlands.In a game of few chances, Breel Embolo had put Switzerland ahead after 75 minutes when he poked home from close range, and Bukayo Saka levelled for England five minutes later with a brilliant strike off the far post.Saka, who missed in England’s Euro 2020 final shootout defeat by Italy, stood up again on Saturday and converted confidently in front of a wall of England fans.Having reached the 1966 World Cup final and 2020 Euros final at Wembley, making it to Berlin next Sunday would be England’s first final away from home soil.To get there they will almost certainly have to find more intensity and accuracy in attack than they showed on Saturday, but the confidence gained from another shootout win after decades of pain will be priceless.England came into the game on the back of two dire performances and, though they showed more invention and movement, there was again little end product, and with the Swiss equally cautious, there was barely a meaningful effort on goal for an hour.Switzerland, impressive victors over Italy last week and seeking their first major semi-final, took the lead when Dan Ndoye whipped in a deflected low cross with Breel Embolo stretching to poke it home.Southgate responded by immediately throwing on three substitutes – Cole Palmer, Luke Shaw and Eberechi Eze - and five minutes later energised England were level as Saka cut in from the right wing and curled a superb 20-metre left-footed shot in off the far post.In extra time England’s Declan Rice had a fizzing shot from the edge of the box brilliantly saved by a diving Yann Sommer, while Xherdan Shaqiri clipped a post direct from a corner, before the penalties that had felt inevitable almost from the start duly arrived.Switzerland had lost three of their four major tournament shootouts, while England’s famously uncomfortable record was seven defeats and two wins. \nRussia blasted the main children’s hospital in Kyiv with a missile in broad daylight on Monday and rained missiles down on other cities across Ukraine, killing at least 41 civilians in the deadliest wave of air strikes for months.Parents holding babies walked in the street outside the hospital, dazed and sobbing after the rare daylight aerial attack. Windows had been smashed and panels ripped off, and hundreds of Kyiv residents were helping to clear debris.“It was scary. I couldn’t breathe, I was trying to cover (my baby). I was trying to cover him with this cloth so that he could breathe,” Svitlana Kravchenko, 33, told Reuters.President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who stopped in Poland before heading off to Washington for a NATO summit, put the death toll at 37, including three children. More than 170 were injured.But tallies of casualties from the sites of attacks in different regions totalled at least 41.Writing on the Telegram messaging app, Zelenskiy said more than 100 buildings had been damaged, including the children’s hospital and a maternity centre in Kyiv, children’s nurseries and a business centre and homes.“The Russian terrorists must answer for this,” he wrote. “Being concerned does not stop terror. Condolences are not a weapon.”The Interior Ministry said there had also been damage in the central cities of Kryvyi Rih and Dnipro and two eastern cities.The government proclaimed a day of mourning on Tuesday for one of the worst air attacks of the war, which it said demonstrated that Ukraine urgently needed an upgrade of its air defences from its Western allies.Air defences shot down 30 of 38 missiles, the air force said.An online video obtained by Reuters showed a missile falling towards the children’s hospital followed by a large explosion. The location of the video was verified from visible landmarks.The Security Service of Ukraine identified the missile as a Kh-101 cruise missile.Kyiv’s military authorities said 27 people had died in the capital, including three children, and 82 were wounded in the main missile volley and a strike that came two hours later.DAMAGE ACROSS THE CAPITALKyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said the attack was one of the largest of the war, causing damage in seven city districts. The Health Minister said five units of the children’s hospital were damaged and children were evacuated to other facilities.Eleven were confirmed dead in the Dnipropetrovsk region and 68 were wounded, regional officials said. Three people were killed in the eastern town of Pokrovsk where missiles hit an industrial facility, the governor said.Zelenskiy, addressing a news conference in Warsaw alongside Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, called on Kyiv’s Western allies to give a firm response to the attack.“We will retaliate against these people, we will deliver a powerful response from our side to Russia, for sure. The question to our partners is: can they respond?” Zelenskiy said.The attack came a day before leaders of NATO countries were due to begin a three-day summit, with the war in Ukraine one of the focuses.US President Joe Biden said that Moscow’s deadly missile strikes in Ukraine, including on the children's hospital in Kyiv, were “a horrific reminder of Russia’s brutality”.In a statement released by the White House, Biden added that Washington and its NATO allies would be announcing new measures to strengthen Ukraine’s air defences.Diplomats said the United Nations Security Council would meet on Tuesday at the request of Britain, France, Ecuador, Slovenia and the United States.The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Türk, deplored the attacks, saying: “Among the victims were Ukraine's sickest children.”Russia’s Defence Ministry said its forces had launched strikes on defence industry targets and aviation bases.Moscow has repeatedly denied targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure, although its attacks have killed thousands of civilians since it launched its invasion in February 2022.Ukraine’s Prosecutor General said he discussed the attacks with International Criminal Court Prosecutor Karim Khan, adding that his office would be sharing evidence with the ICC.Ukraine’s Defence Minister Rustem Umerov said Ukraine still lacked enough air defences and urged Kyiv's allies to supply more systems promptly to protect cities from Russian attacks.Air Force representative Colonel Yuri Ignat said it became more difficult to repel Russian attacks as Moscow’s forces kept enhancing their bombardment tactics.“Enemy missiles are equipped with additional means, including radar and thermal traps,” Ignat wrote on Facebook.The missiles flew at extremely low altitudes during Monday’s attacks, he said.DTEK, the largest private power producer, said three electricity substations and networks had been damaged in Kyiv.The power system has already sustained so much damage from targeted Russian air strikes that began in March that electricity cuts have become widespread. \nFrance faced a hung parliament and the prospect of taxing negotiations starting Monday to form a government, after a surprise left-wing surge blocked Marine Le Pen’s quest to bring the far right to power.The leftist New Popular Front (NFP) emerged as the dominant force in the National Assembly after Sunday’s election, but with no single group securing a working majority the possibilities include the NFP forming a minority government or the building of a broad, unwieldy coalition.The result delivered a stinging blow to President Emmanuel Macron and leaves the euro zone’s second largest economy in limbo, heralding a period of political instability just weeks before Paris hosts the Olympic Games.Macron ended up with a hugely fragmented parliament, in what is set to weaken France’s role in the European Union and further afield, and make it hard for anyone to push through a domestic agenda.The left won 182 seats, Macron’s centrist alliance 168 and Le Pen’s National Rally (RN) and allies 143, interior ministry data cited by Le Monde newspaper showed.Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said he would tender his resignation, but it was not clear whether the president would accept it immediately, given the daunting task ahead to form a government. Attal said he would be willing to stay on in a caretaker role.“I will of course do my duties as long as it’s needed - it cannot be otherwise on the eve of a date (the Olympics) that is so important for our country,” Attal said as it became clear Macron’s alliance had endured a humbling setback.Parties from the NFP—made up of the French Communist Party, hard left France Unbowed, the Greens and the Socialist Party—met overnight for first talks on how to proceed.France Unbowed’s firebrand leader Jean-Luc Melenchon said the new prime minister should hail from NFP. However, the bloc has no leader, and the its parties are strongly divided over who they could select as a suitable premier.Some prominent centrist figures, including Edouard Philippe, a former prime minister under Macron, said they were ready to work on a pact to ensure a stable government.The euro fell on Sunday after the vote projections were announced.“There’s really going to be a vacuum when it comes to France’s legislative ability,” said Simon Harvey, head of FX analysis at Monex Europe in London.For Le Pen’s RN, the result was a far cry from weeks during which opinion polls consistently projected it would win comfortably.The left and centrist alliances cooperated after the first round of voting last week by pulling scores of candidates from three-way races to build a unified anti-RN vote.In his first reaction, RN leader Jordan Bardella, Le Pen’s protege, called the cooperation between anti-RN forces a “disgraceful alliance” that he said would paralyse France.Le Pen, who will likely be the party’s candidate for the 2027 presidential election, said however that Sunday’s ballot, in which the RN made major gains compared with previous elections, had sown the seeds for the future.“Our victory has been merely delayed,” she said.As darkness fell on Sunday, the statue of Marianne in Place de la Republique was lit up by fireworks amid celebrations by left-wing supporters. Marianne is a national symbol of France, representing reason, liberty and the ideals of the republic.Baptiste Fourastié, a 23-year-old designer in Place de la Republique, said, “we weren’t expecting it, neither were the polls. We are happy that the French people succeeded once more in blocking the far right.”However he was worried that they right may grow in strength and win next time if the next government is not beyond reproach.“It will be difficult with a hung parliament, but better than if it was the far right (ahead),” he said. \nJust a pat on the back by preacher “Bhole Baba” and Ramkumari said a stone in her kidney vanished. The 85-year-old gave no proof but this story and countless others of similar “miracles” led to Baba’s following rocketing in India’s northern states.A gathering addressed by the former police head constable in a crowded field last week drew a quarter of a million people and caused one of the deadliest stampedes in the country.Bhole Baba, or Innocent Elder, was born Suraj Pal Singh Jatav. He quit the police in 2000 to join a series of Hindu preachers and gurus in India who are sought by millions for miracle cures and spiritual advice. They are often called godmen, and many have been wooed by politicians for the influence they wield.Their patrons have included international celebrities like the Beatles, who spent days in the ashram of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in the late 1960s. Some of these gurus expanded beyond India, most famously Osho, who lived and preached in the United States in the early 1980s.Almost all of them are credited by their followers with miraculous powers.“I had gone to one of his early gatherings and told him I had chronic pain from a kidney stone for many months,” said Ramkumari, Baba’s former neighbour in Bahadurnagar village in India’s Uttar Pradesh state, where he was born and still has a home.The village has only about 50 homes in all and is set amid fields which grow corn, wheat and rice. On the periphery is a sprawling, pearly-white ashram run by devotees of Baba.“He smiled and blessed me with a pat on the back. The stone vanished soon after,” said Ramkumari, who gave just one name.Another resident in the village, 55-year-old Surajmukhi, said Baba’s blessing helped her give birth to a son after seven daughters. Sons are sought after in many Indian families.“We desperately wanted a boy,” said Surajmukhi. “Then I met Baba with my husband. He made me chant some mantras (verses), gave me some water to drink and patted me on my back. After nine months I had a baby boy.”Lying on a cot next to her, Baba’s older sister Sonkali, thin and frail, said: “It was a miracle”.Baba, formally known as Narayan Sakar Hari now, is estimated to be about 72 by his family and followers, who are spread across India’s heartland states of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh.Line to godTwo neighbours who have known him since his childhood, including Ramkumari, said he took the path after a dream one night about 25 years ago that a divine spirit had given him supernatural powers. He quit the police in the city of Agra and started preaching, they said.Baba would later claim he had a direct line to God and could channel divine blessings to people.“Soon after we saw a line of cars bringing Suraj Pal into the village and people said he would henceforth be called a Baba (elder),” Ramkumari said.Reuters could not contact Baba. He told Reuters partner ANI that he was grieving and his aides would help the injured and the families of the deceased.The stampede at his gathering on Tuesday killed 121 people, mostly women, and injured scores out of about 250,000 who had congregated in a canopied paddy field to listen to him, many trampling over one another as they ran after his car when he was leaving.Police say authorities had allowed only 80,000 to attend, and have arrested six aides to Baba who were involved in organising the event. The main organiser surrendered to police on Friday.Police said that in the initial days of his rise to fame, Baba had claimed that he could bring the dead back to life and even tried to take away the body of a 16-year-old girl from a crematorium promising a miracle to the family. Police intervened and the matter was closed soon after.Posters and videos posted on YouTube show him dressed in traditional Indian kurta tunics or pristine white suits and ties, often sporting sunglasses, a departure from the spartan image of most godmen.Still, his clout is smaller than other gurus and godmen in India, including Sri Sri Ravi Shankar and Sadhguru. Yoga guruBaba Ramdev, known to be close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, runs the Patanjali consumer goods brand that has boomed in recent years.Two godmen, Asaram Bapu and Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, were both convicted of rape in separate cases and jailed, after years of drawing thousands of devotees to their sermons and ashrams.Give people hopeSociologists say such gurus are often believed to possess healing powers, and are especially popular among those who are poor, sick or feel underprivileged.“People are insecure - economically, socially and otherwise,” said Dipti Ranjan Sahu, head of sociology at the University of Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh.“Unemployment, deprivation, discrimination, ignorance, illiteracy - these things play a part. So they see hope in the godmen, maybe some miracle will happen.”Surinder Singh Jodhka, who teaches social sciences at New Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru University and has researched on the subject, said “people are kind of looking for some meaning in their life” and that’s where godmen come in.“People are feeling lost and they are looking for some sense through which they can identify with other people, they feel less lonely,” he said. “This gives them hope and they are willing to believe in it.” \nHamas is waiting for a response from Israel on its ceasefire proposal, two officials from the Palestinian group said on Sunday, five days after it accepted a key part of a US plan aimed at ending the nine-month war in Gaza.“We have left our response with the mediators and are waiting to hear the occupation’s response,” one of the two Hamas officials told Reuters, asking not to be named.The three-phase plan was put forward at the end of May by US President Joe Biden and is being mediated by Qatar and Egypt. It aims to end the war and free around 120 Israeli hostages being held by Hamas.Another Palestinian official, with knowledge of the ongoing ceasefire deliberations, said Israel was in talks with the Qataris.“They have discussed with them Hamas’ response and they promised to give them Israel’s response within days,” the official, who asked not to be named, told Reuters on Sunday.Israel’s government made no immediate comment on the timing of its deliberations.Hamas, which controls Gaza, has dropped a key demand that Israel first commit to a permanent ceasefire before signing an agreement. Instead, it said it would allow negotiations to achieve that throughout the six-week first phase, a Hamas source told Reuters on Saturday on condition of anonymity because the talks are private.A Palestinian official close to the peace efforts has said the proposal could lead to a framework agreement if embraced by Israel and would end the war.US Central Intelligence Agency Director William Burns will travel to Qatar next week for negotiations, a source familiar with the matter said.The conflict, triggered by an October 7 attack on Israel by Hamas fighters, has claimed the lives of more than 38,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials.Hamas killed 1,200 people and took around 250 hostages in the worst assault in Israel’s history, according to official Israeli figures.FIFTEEN KILLED IN GAZA STRIKESProtesters took to the streets across Israel on Sunday to pressure the government to reach an accord to bring back Israeli hostages still being held in Gaza.They blocked rush hour traffic at major intersections across the country, picketed politicians’ houses and briefly set fire to tyres on the main Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway before police cleared the way.Meanwhile, fighting continued to rage across Gaza, which has been largely reduced to rubble in the conflict.Palestinian health officials said at least 15 people were killed in separate Israeli military strikes across the enclave on Sunday.An Israeli air strike on a house in the town of Zawayda, in central Gaza, killed at least six people and wounded several others, while six others were killed in an air strike on a house in western Gaza, the health officials said.Tanks deepened their raids in central and northern areas of Rafah on the southern border with Egypt. Health officials there said they had recovered three bodies of Palestinians killed by Israeli fire in the eastern part of the city.The Israeli military said on Sunday its forces have killed 30 Palestinian gunmen in Rafah during close combat and air strikes.In Shejaia, an eastern suburb of Gaza City, the military said its forces killed several Palestinian gunmen, and located weapons and explosives.The armed wings of Hamas and the Islamic Jihad said fighters attacked Israeli forces in several locations across the Gaza Strip with anti-tank rockets and mortar bombs. \nNepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) \nBharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality’s ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via ‘tallo bato’—backdoor route—and that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal. \nGyanumaya BK had been suffering from severe backaches for a while. The resident of Pokhara-15, BK visited the Metrocity Hospital in Srijanachowk seeking treatment five months ago. The 69-year-old, who works as a labourer, has already spent over Rs50,000 on follow-up checkups and medications.BK spent eight days in the hospital in January and has been paying off loans she had taken to pay her bills and for follow-up visits to the hospital. Had BK been aware of the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020, which private hospitals must adhere to, she wouldn’t have had to borrow money to pay her medical bills. As per the regulations, hospitals must set aside 10 percent of their total beds to the underprivileged and needy.“I didn’t know hospitals were required to provide free treatment to those who can’t afford hospital stays,” BK said. “But even if I did, I would have to fight to get the service as the hospital won’t willingly offer me the service.”The Pokhara-based 50-bed hospital’s Chief Executive Officer Gyan Prasad Aryal admits that his hospital does not adhere to the mandate. “We don’t have explicit information from the health ministry on the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020,” said Aryal. “Moving forward, we will follow the instructions.” The hospital authorities say they give a 10-15 percent discount on the final hospital bill as opposed to dedicating 10 percent of their beds and free treatment and medications to the less privileged. Hospitals with 15 beds come under the jurisdiction of the local units while those with up to 50 beds fall under the ambit of the Provincial Health Directorate. Likewise, the Provincial Health Ministry oversees health facilities with over 50 beds.However, no regulatory body has data on whether health facilities are following government rules, especially Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. But it is an open secret that most private hospitals in Pokhara are not following the regulations.Pokhara Municipality Health Department Officer Yadunath Baral, Kaski District Health Officer Bhim Prasad Poudel, and Province Health Director Khim Bahadur Khadka all admit that local hospitals disregard the regulations. “Our monitoring and inspection is also lax, that’s why most hospitals ignore the rules,” he said. He says lack of manpower hampers effective inspection. “Our manpower is enough to conduct inspections in other districts, but not in Kaski, which has many private hospitals,” he said. “We need more people for that”. According to Baral, although the hospitals claim to offer a certain discount on final bills to the needy, they are unable to show the record of the discounts provided. “The hospitals claim they give discounts, but most hospitals have not even been able to show us the proof,” said Khadka. “Legal actions should be taken against the hospitals that fail to submit a monthly report on the free services for the poor. More importantly, they must be liable for flouting government standards that aim to benefit the poor.” The Provincial Health Directorate also does not have any data on the directive’s implementation at hospitals with more than 50 beds.The department’s chief of health services Dr Ramesh KC says that they have been working on updating information of health services in the Gandaki region. “Hospitals have failed to submit their mandatory monthly reports. We will seek that information when they come for new permits or permit renewal,” KC said. There are 27 privately-owned hospitals within the Pokhara Metropolitan City and 39 in the Gandaki region. Bharatpur Metropolitan City in Chitwan in Bagmati Province is also called the ‘medical city’  as it is home to 23 private hospitals with a total of 1,200 beds. Additionally, there are multiple large-scale government hospitals and two medical colleges—Chitwan Medical College and College of Medical Sciences—that also provide medical services. Had the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020 been followed by the 23 private hospitals, 120 patients would have received free health services every year, according to Durgadutta Chapagain, chief of the Chitwan Health Office.“Although the hospitals claim they provide the services, none have been able to provide convincing proof. Instead, we found them giving such discounts to patients who are close to hospital operators,” said Chapagain. “Our department validates the permits for new health facilities and re-registrations for hospitals with a 25-bed capacity. We have asked such public health service providers to put up posters or stickers reading ‘Discounts for the needy’ on the hospital premises so that patients know what services they can get on discount.”Meanwhile, Bikram Adhikari, Secretary of the Private Hospitals Coordination Committee in Chitwan, claims that the regulations are impractical. “There are a few services that hospitals can provide free of cost. You cannot expect hospitals to provide all services for free. That’s why there is a need to amend the existing regulations,” said Adhikari.The monitoring bodies’ inaction and lackadaisical approach to ensuring that public health services are accessible and affordable to all makes private hospitals blatantly ignore government mandates.Bharatpur Metropolitan City’s Deputy Mayor Chitrasen Adhikari says that although the metropolis is aware that private hospitals must allocate 10 percent of their beds for free treatment of poor people, the metropolis administration has yet to devise a monitoring mechanism. “We have not taken any steps towards that end, but we will soon,” he said.Just like Pokhara and Chitwan, Biratnagar is also plagued with the same problem. There are 32 private hospitals currently in operation in the metropolis. Deepak Bhattarai, statistical officer at the municipality’s health office, asserts that none of the health facilities met the set requirements. A monthly report submitted by the Biratnagar-based Nobel Medical College and Teaching Hospital, which has 750 beds, stated that the hospital had provided the said concession to more than 400 patients. “However, the report did not clarify how many of the 400 patients were provided free hospital beds and the services that come along with the beds, and how many were given discounts on their hospital bills,” Bhattarai said. “We found that hospital reports also include concessions provided to patients who sought outpatient, emergency, and X-ray services.”The hospital’s director Narayan Dahal claims to be following all government instructions. He says 10 percent hospital beds are set aside for needy patients who are not charged any treatment fees, while 10 percent of service seekers also get discounts.Although the Biratnagar Metropolis has directed all health facilities under its jurisdiction to allocate free beds and provide free services to the needy, inform service seekers about the government-provided services, and submit a list of all patients who have received the services, the directive is ignored more often than followed. According to Bhattarai, medical establishments must get a letter from the local unit before making any upgrades or purchasing any equipment. “But the hospitals have been found presenting fake documents in order to acquire such permits,” he said. “The metropolis has refused such permits to 12 private hospitals in the current fiscal year.”Butwal Sub-Metropolitan City in the Lumbini Province has also taken no concrete step to ensure private hospitals adhere to Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. Despite having the authority to carry out inspections, the sub-metropolis’ apathy has deprived hundreds of needy patients of various government services. The sub-metropolis with 17 wards has more than two dozen big hospitals in the Butwal bazaar area itself. Not one of them adheres to the government’s health regulations. But the sub-metropolis is yet to monitor these hospitals. Yubraj Pandey, chief of Butwal Sub Metropolitan’s health department, says they have been unable to inspect medical institutes due to a lack of a proper set of rules.“I have just been transferred here. Discussions are underway to prepare legal requirements,” he said. Private hospitals in Butwal only began filing their reports two months ago after a joint meeting, informs Chief of the Sub Metropolitan’s Education and Health Department Mitramani Khanal. Twenty-year-old Suraj BK of Sarawal Rural Municipality-2 in West Nawalparasi got into a motorcycle accident on April 26. He suffered injuries on both his legs and was taken to Zenus Hospital and Research Centre in Butwal. Suraj was handed a bill of Rs 70,000 for treatment but he did not have the money to clear the bill and sought the hospital’s help. “The hospital refused to provide any discount. They in fact refused to discharge me. I got my discharge papers only four days later after I paid almost Rs 100,000,” he said. “I had to get a loan to pay the hospital bills as my father, who is a farmer, did not have that kind of money.”Dr Sharda Singh, the hospital director, said Suraj did not qualify for a discount as he did not have a recommendation letter from the local unit. “Patients have to get a recommendation to avail of free services at private hospitals but Suraj could not bring one,” she said. “I was in the hospital bed for four days. I could not have secured a recommendation from the local unit in that state,” said Suraj. Ishwari Prasad Chapagain, a civil society leader of Rupandehi and a member of the Consumer Interest Protection Forum, says private hospitals in Butwal are more interested in making money than helping those in need. “They do not follow government mandates. They act as if they have to bear the expenses of providing free service to the poor when in fact they get tax rebates and such for such services,” he said. “The sub-metropolis also does not do the needful. Everyone is corrupt including the city officials.”  \nUniversities worldwide are facing different crises, ranging from constricting finances to dwindling student numbers and diminishing academic autonomy. Nepali universities cannot be expected to remain independent of the global and local environments. Some of the challenges they face are unique, and so they require tailor-made responses.As the number of students opting to study abroad increases yearly, Nepali universities are scrambling to fill their seats. Recent data from the Ministry of Education show that Nepali students sent Rs104.25 billion as tuition fees to foreign universities in the first 10 months of Fiscal Year 2023-24, as per the Nepal Rashtra Bank. Such payments stood at Rs112.52 billion and Rs75.14 billion, respectively, in the same period of the previous year.A whopping 97,000 students have obtained the no-objection certificate (NOC) for education abroad in the first nine months of FY 2023-24. A total of 110,000 and 113,000 students obtained NOC in fiscal years 2022-23 and 2021-22, respectively, a 300 percent rise in a decade, as per the ministry.These figures are staggering. Even as they show a dangerous trend of the country’s exodus of human capital and financial resources, they leave us with the question: How do Nepali universities survive? As the students leave the country in droves, universities face half-filled classrooms and depleting financial resources. For now, publicly funded universities like Tribhuvan University and Nepal Sanskrit University may not have to worry about their finances. However, self-funding universities like Kathmandu University (KU) and Pokhara University, which largely sustain on tuition fees, face an existential question as the number of students falls and their earnings plummet.Diversifying revenue sourcesFor university administrators, not having to worry about financial problems is a great advantage, for one can concentrate on academics and research, the major functions of the university. Kathmandu University faced this gruelling question of long-term financial sustainability, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. Technically, the university was not likely to face a financial crisis in the short run, even during the pandemic, for it had a comfortable financial cushion. But we could foresee a looming crisis in case the pandemic dragged on. We could not expect students to continue paying tuition fees if the income sources of their parents or guardians took a hit. In any case, KU generates only 60 percent of its revenue from tuition fees, while it receives about 10 percent of funding from the government. Exploring funding sources for the remaining 30 percent is a persistent challenge, as an unhindered university operation hinges on this.Diversifying funding sources is crucial to the financial sustainability of universities, particularly those not publicly funded. It is also critical for the autonomy of academic governance. Despite having to keep an eye on the financial resources all the time, one advantage of receiving a minuscule amount of funding from the government is that universities can exercise relatively better academic freedom, ranging from faculty appointment to curriculum design and research. But how are we to diversify financial sources when the student numbers are coming down and the country's economic growth is nearly stagnant year after year?This is where the endowment model comes in as a major funding source, even for Nepal's self-funded universities.Endowment modelGlobally, endowments form a successful model for diversifying funding sources in universities. Thousands of universities worldwide run on different kinds of endowment funds institutions and individuals provide. Usually, a portion of the earnings from the endowments is used towards running costs or specific university projects, thus ensuring long-term financial security for the university. The US-based Harvard University has 14,000 endowments today, with the total size exceeding $50.7 billion. The endowments contributed $2.2 billion to the university's operating budget in 2023 alone. Stanford University's endowment fund was valued at $36.3 billion in 2023, with the endowment payout standing at $1.74 billion, covering 23 percent of the university's operating expenses. Top American universities continue to tap the goodwill of donors and alumni to strengthen their financial standing. These generous endowments allow the universities to pay their faculty and staff well, fund their students' tuition and research and innovate.Culturally, endowment is not a new concept in Nepal. The guthi system has been in operation for centuries, where the community chips in resources to fund initiatives that are especially relevant to community work. The Newar community in the Kathmandu Valley and elsewhere is the best example of communities coming together to finance their common objectives. The guthis established by wealthy rulers, business persons and landowners in the past helped educate a significant number of Nepalis in Indian cities like Benares and Calcutta. The Madan Puraskar Library, offering two scholarships every year for studying medicine in Calcutta, is a continuation of this culture. The Rajkiya Sanskrit School in Matihani, Mahottari and the Ramswarup Ramsagar Multiple Campus in Janakpur, Dhanusha are some examples of endowments strengthening Nepal's education system.Public-spirited individuals who wanted to contribute to Nepal's future through education laid the financial foundation of KU in its formative years. These individuals include a businessman named Rana Bahadur Shah, who helped build the university's library and offered his mansion in Lazimpat to set up the university’s offices in its initial days. As a gesture of gratitude to Shah, the university founded the Rana Bahadur Shah Gold Medal fund. The university continued to receive generous funds from individuals and institutions along the way, with notable contributions from its alumni as well as businesspersons and philanthropists, including Mohan Gopal Khetan, Gopal Rajbhandari, Juddha Bahadur Shah, Krishna KC, and Prof. Bidya Nath Koirala. Growing endowmentsAcquiring endowments and making them grow requires a systemic approach to financial management. KU’s efforts at organising dedicated fundraising programmes and strategically mobilising its surplus funds have been quite successful. The number of endowment funds has grown from around 12 to 53 in the past three and a half years, and the size of the fund has grown over tenfold, from around Rs60 million to Rs650 million. This growth has helped set up scholarships, fellowships, medals, awards, and educational loans for students while also strengthening the capacity of faculty and staff.The sources of such endowments have been pretty diverse—from individuals offering money in memory of their loved ones to national and international institutions providing funds, alumni giving back to their university, and faculty transferring the earnings and savings from external research projects. To ensure steady growth from the endowments, universities can follow the conservative route of investing in fixed deposits at “A Class” commercial banks that offer competitive interest rates and investment security. One way to utilise this scheme is to spend 50 percent of the income from interests and reinvest the remaining amount in the principal investment. However, conservative investments such as bank interests come with fluctuating returns. Diversifying the investment portfolio by investing in non-collateralised assets while devising clear guidelines and risk-hedging strategies is paramount. The experiment with the endowment model has proved to be a significant alternative funding model for KU. This could be a blueprint for self-funding and even public universities in Nepal, especially if we can incorporate international fund management practices for sustainable operation and growth through endowments. \nDemocracies are no better than other forms of government at avoiding catastrophic mistakes. But they are much more effective at rectifying them. While the 2024 British general election might have seemed a long time coming, as the country meandered from one failure to the next, the utter scale of defeat for the Conservatives is testament to the ability of a democratic system to reject, reverse and renew.It also places a singular challenge on the desk of the new prime minister, Keir Starmer. He will be judged by his ability to restore probity to government and address the damage suffered by the country.It is easy to see this election in the tradition of other big defeats like 1997 or 1979 or 1964. A powerful theme of “time for a change” was at play and the governing party seemed to have run out of steam. It can even be interpreted as sending a powerful message to Rishi Sunak’s Conservative party that voters wanted to inflict punishment for incompetence, economic mismanagement and sleaze.But this one is more than that.The now former governing party, returned with a majority of 80 in 2019, has been beaten to within an inch of its life. A generation of politicians long criticised for treating public life with contempt, have been ejected from office and parliament.Step back, and this election can be seen as democracy rectifying the catalogue of its own glaring mistakes. Since the calamitous Brexit referendum eight years ago, Britain has suffered economic decay and a cost of living crisis (briefly exacerbated by Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng’s disastrous so-called “mini-budget”).It has endured a government with a lengthy record of rule breaking reflected in the UK falling to its lowest ever ranking in the Global Corruption Index. It has seen dodgy pandemic procurement contracts handed out, party donors appointed to the House of Lords and a sustained attack on its constitution, institutions, and rule of law. Tiresome culture war crusades have divided communities and polluted public life.Denigration of public services from education to the NHS to the armed forces, crises in housing, the climate and inequality have been left unchallenged. Damage has been done to the country’s international reputation and relations strained with the UK’s closest allies in Europe.What these errors have in common is that each one sits firmly at the door of 10 Downing Street and its four most recent inhabitants. This election emphatically draws a line under them.Parties can fallFor so long in opposition and even during this campaign, Starmer’s party has danced to the populist tune of the government and its media cheerleaders. The challenge for his new administration as it takes power is to recognise that this election is a watershed, a rejection of this catalogue of mistakes, and an expectation of political renewal.The more existential question is whether this election is also a watershed moment that will permanently change the shape of British politics. Could we be witnessing the demise of the Conservative party and the end of its hegemonic position at the centre of public life?It happened to the previously dominant Liberal party a century ago when it split down the middle and was replaced by a new emerging Labour party. Such a shift is rare, of course, and requires some sort of major disruption.In the years following the fist world war, Labour’s rise was fuelled by an extension in the franchise so significant that it makes the proposed votes for today’s 1.5 million 16 and 17-year-olds appear trifling. Indeed the Representation of the People acts more than doubled the electorate by giving the vote to women and the 40 percent of (working-class) men who were also previously disenfranchised.There is nothing quite so seismic heading Westminster’s way today (though plans for automatic registration could add millions of voters). But the potential for comparison should not be dismissed.Post-Brexit realignment, realignedParty identification in the electorate, which has been in decline since the 1960s was turned on its head in 2019 when Boris Johnson’s Tories won a swathe of red wall seats in the Midlands and the north of England. For the first time, Labour voters were wealthier than Conservative. Labour, of course, went down to its worst defeat since 1935. There was talk of a new political cleavage, where class divisions had been replaced by leavers and remainers.That this has all been reversed in the space of one parliament demonstrates the incredible fluidity in the electorate today. The more than 70 seats that have gone to the Liberal Democrats show the determination of the electorate to vote tactically to remove Conservatives in spite of an electoral system that has historically kept them in office.And then there is Reform. Nigel Farage’s rag bag of a party has proved to be the ultimate protest vote for disenchanted Tory voters, attracted to the open acknowledgement that few if any seats could be won but the higher the vote, the harder the beating for the Conservatives.As it happens, millions more voted Reform than was reflected in their seat share. While there are some leading Tories who would still welcome him into the fold, Farage perhaps overplayed his hand during the campaign making the Conservatives defensive of a rival, hell bent on their destruction. Time will tell if the Conservatives can resist the onslaught but for now the psychodrama of the right will be a political sideshow to the main event: An innocent new government and a refreshed parliament.Britain’s parliamentary democracy facilitated this catalogue of mistakes which have proved so damaging to the country over recent years. But in this election it has also proved highly effective at beginning the work to rectification. If Starmer gets a moment to catch his breath, he might reflect upon this as the key reason he has been handed such a decisive majority.—The Conversation \nThe birth centenary of former prime minister and Nepali Congress president Girija Prasad Koirala alias Girija Babu (1924-2010) was marked on July 4, 2024. The centenary occasion evoked my memories and impressions about him. Though I never met him, I saw him at the momentous moments of history. This is a short visceral piece written mainly to mark Girija Babu's birth centenary. Since I am not a political scientist or knew him closely, I have not made attempts to analyse Girija Babu's politics and his sense of victory and loss in his life. His party has made some attempts towards that. I also edited a short text of an obituary sent to me shortly after his death by Sujata Koirala, whom I have met once.By all standards, it is an important day not only for the party he led but also for all who especially remember the important modes of transition in Nepali history. Girija Babu is remembered for a couple of very important metamorphoses that this country experienced—the signing of the comprehensive peace agreement with the Maoist guerrillas in 2006 and the abolition of monarchy in Nepal. These historical occasions resulted from the transitions that the Nepali people had brought about especially from the year 1990. Girija Babu was the prime minister of Nepal during that period. We can mention the four occasions when he became the prime minister. The years when he headed the governments were crucial moments in Nepali history—1991 to 1994, 1998 to 1999, 2000 to 2001, and 2006 to 2008. He also became acting head of state between January 2007 and July 2008 as the country was in a very important mode of change. History had bequeathed that onus on him.Girija Babu worked with the cohorts for the promotion of the democratic values as espoused by his brother, late BP Koirala, and other leaders of different parties. The people who worked with democratic commitments to various modes of modernisation know that the process of history is not simple. Though they have been working with new ideas, they know that the forces that work against such innovative spirit are far from defeated. Fareed Zakaria, in his recently published book, Age of Revolutions: Progress and Backlash From 1600 to the Present (2024), cogently analyses this subject in a historical context. Zakaria also reveals the challenging and interesting problematics of the day. Girija Babu, as the title of his book Simple Convictions (2010) shows, was not a very learned person. But his commitment to democratic values was very important and remarkable. The subtitle of the book \"My struggle for peace and democracy\", tends to spell that out. This book covers the period between the takeover by King Gyanendra Shah in October 2002 to the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement with the Maoists in 2006. Girija Babu called that event \"the last struggle of my life\". The title of Kanak Dixit's “Preface” to Simple Convictions, \"GP: Man of the moment\", foregrounds the same feature. But history is the most powerful force behind Girija Babu's pragmatism he practised without espousing any of its philosophical aspects of thinking. The history of democratic struggle shaped the flow of his moments, to use the Buddhist terminology. I was asked to speak at the launch of the book on March 21, 2010, by its publisher Madhab Lal Mharjan of Mandala Book Point. Not being a Congress Party person or a political theorist, I spoke like a literary writer and theatre person that created similar effect on the occasion. I felt inspired to speak about the book because of its candidness and simplicity. I had even used the term “subalternity” to describe some of GP Koirala's modus operandi while commenting on the book.I want to mention another event that evokes my memory of Girija Babu. It was the occasion of the 14th SAARC Summit held in New Delhi on 13 April 2007. The Summit was being held at Vigyan Bhawan and our SAARC literary conference was being held at writer Ajeet Cour's Art Academy. The same date was a coincidence and had nothing to do with our conference. Girija Babu participated in and addressed the SAARC summit. He was seen there as a successful prime minister, and a peacemaker who had worked with other parties to put an end to the Maoist insurgency through peaceful negotiation. Using supplemental oxygen, Girija Babu looked in Delhi like someone fighting to fulfil a mission for peace and stability; he had attracted the attention of politicians and the media.Girija Babu died on March 20, 2010, at the residence of his daughter, Sujata Koirala, in Mandikhatar. My colleague and student Shiva Rijal and I reached there very early in the morning and stood outside, overlooking the compound. Politicians like Krishna Prasad Bhattarai, Pushpa Kamal Dahal and others came and went. We heard Dahal calling “Girijababu!” loudly and saw Kisunji leaving in a sombre mood. Narayan Wagle, the then editor of Nagarik Daily, asked me to write an obituary of Girija Babu. I am citing the following lines from the obit, which was published the following day. \"Can we say Girija Babu's death marks the end of an era? The answer to this question is not easy, because he departed not by ending an era but by heralding a fresh continuation. In other words, his death did not mark the end of a period in history; instead, it ushered a complex time to manage. We can see that a number of things go with the death of those who have played important roles in history. Liminal lines separate them. But Girija Babu's death put them alongside.\"I recited a poem written on Girija Babu's death at the SAARC literary conference in Delhi the following year. I cite lines from a few stanzas: That was a daywhen he like any otherSouth Asian makers of historygently went into a sleepbehind a lawn where I waswatching sparrows tickle the backof a nondescript morningthat matured into a gloomy day…when the last words in a text were putunder history's unblinking eyes. …In demise of this man;I don't knowif my words would have made sense to himbecause he was a simple farmerwho planted sky with dreams intactin these turbulent fields. …I don't knowif these farmershave lived long enough toreap the harvests of their dream seedsunder the familiar skieswhere we have all invested our dreams.Girija Prasad Koirala played out poetry in history without being close to the Muse. \nCOVID-19 still poses a threat globally, with Nepal experiencing a spike in Omicron sub-lineages and deaths continuing worldwide; vaccination campaigns aim to protect vulnerable groups, including immunocompromised children and the elderly.\nThe Nepali Congress and CPN-UML formed a government, sidelining Pushpa Kamal Dahal and the Rastriya Swatantra Party, which faces internal turmoil after its short-lived coalition experience.\nAmidst distrust, Nepali Congress and CPN-UML leaders Deuba and Oli formed a midnight pact to establish a new government, displacing Dahal's administration and raising questions about democratic principles and loyalty.\nNepal's Congress and UML form a coalition government under Oli's leadership, aiming to implement constitutional amendments focused on political stability, economic growth, and governance.\nOver 52% of students failed the SEE due to poor teaching quality and an unprepared letter grading system implementation, leading to concerns about the test system and the need for teacher training and curriculum updates.\nThe government’s recent decision to recall ambassadors, particularly Nepal’s envoy to India, just ahead of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s visit to New Delhi, courted widespread controversy. What are the takeaways of the prime minister’s Delhi visit? What is the progress in implementing the trade and transit agreement signed with China and with the BRI projects? Thira Lal Bhusal of the Post sat down with Rupak Sapkota, foreign affairs advisor to the prime minister, for some insights.The government’s decision to recall ambassadors from 11 countries at once has come under heavy criticism. Why did the government take such a decision?In general, it has become a practice of sorts to recall incumbent ambassadors and appoint new ones after changes in the government or in the ruling coalition. This has both merits and demerits. The country’s foreign policy doesn’t change with a change in government. But every government and coalition has its specific policies, programmes and priorities. Therefore, even other countries make changes in political appointments as per the government’s priorities. Our case is a bit different. Ruling coalitions are frequently changed, and so are ambassadors. As there is a high chance of our politics being governed by coalitions given our electoral system, it has become necessary to establish a rational system on ambassadorial appointment. Either the political appointees themselves should voluntarily quit the job and return home just like vice-chair and members of the National Planning Commission do. Or there should be a consensus among major political forces to allow our ambassadors to serve out the full term.The second option of allowing ambassadors to serve out their term sounds better, doesn’t it?Definitely. Some initiatives have been taken with the objective of making our diplomatic appointments more prestigious, merit-based and better-managed. The government in 2019 introduced some criteria on ambassadorial appointments. We have to put more effort into ensuring that our ambassadorial appointees have the capacity to effectively carry out diplomatic duties. Once we establish a system of appointing envoys based on merit and not out of political biases, we can create a situation of allowing them to serve for the full term. Then, a change of coalition wouldn’t affect their continuity. We need to develop such a political consensus, given our geopolitical sensitivity.But the ambassadors appointed in recent years and their activities in host countries have lowered the bar of our diplomacy.We have seen rapid and huge changes in power equations in the world. In view of that, we can see some countries have appointed former ministers and even prime ministers as envoys to the countries with whom they have vital relations. They also appoint such personalities as envoys for a special mission. So, we have to think about ambassadorial appointments from different perspectives based on the changed context. It is high time that all the political forces and leaders agree on a basic point that those who have in-depth understanding and expertise of the field and can work for the best interest of the country will be appointed the country’s ambassadors. If the individual is competent, the person’s affiliation to a political party may not be a problem. But whether the person can work in the best interest of the country must be considered before appointment.But the government itself doesn’t seem serious about maintaining diplomatic decorum. For instance, the June 6 Cabinet meeting decided to recall the ambassador from India just days ahead of the prime minister’s New Delhi visit. There were also reports that the prime minister made the decision reluctantly due to pressure from coalition partners. What is the real story?It is nothing more than a coincidence. There were discussions about making changes in the ambassadorial positions in line with the March 4 changes in the ruling coalition. But it was deferred as the government needed to accomplish some important tasks and convene events such as the investment summit. When the government decided to change our ambassadors, it just happened to coincide with the prime minister’s visit to New Delhi to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It was a coincidence. Despite the decision, the ambassador had sufficient time to properly conclude all his engagements and duties there. The way he facilitated the process during the prime minister’s visit doesn’t reflect any misgivings about the government’s decision. So, it should be taken as a course that is in keeping with our tradition. In recent decades, other countries have given top priority to economic diplomacy, but the selection of our envoys and their activities doesn’t reflect that. Why aren’t we thinking in that direction?Yes, diplomacy in the past used to be one-dimensional, or it was conducted mainly by one particular ministry—the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. These days, many other ministries are engaged with international agencies. Economic diplomacy, labour diplomacy, climate diplomacy and security affairs have become crucial. We have to increase coordination, cooperation and collaboration among relevant agencies to make our international relations more fruitful and in line with the policies and goals set by our government.We have seen profound changes in terms of approaches, perspectives and dynamics of diplomacy in recent decades. All countries have started to give more importance to the competence of diplomats also in view of the increased geopolitical competition and rivalry seen between world powers. Rapid innovation in science and technology has not only eased our lives but also added challenges. We have to handle so many diplomatic engagements. Similarly, the number of international forums where we have to engage are increasing. These days, multilateral diplomacy and engagements have become as important. Even minilateral forums have started to play vital roles in international relations as the world powers have adopted multiple strategies to create their spheres of influence. In the meantime, the role of public diplomacy has become influential. So, a diplomat today must be dynamic and efficient enough to grasp the international situation, understand the sensitivity of the host country, articulate our country’s views efficiently and work in national interest. Therefore, it has become vital to be extra careful while selecting ambassadors.You talked about better coordination but we don’t see any correction in the practice of bypassing the foreign ministry while working with international agencies.Definitely, the foreign ministry is our focal point for all international relations conducted by a ministry or agency of our country. There should be no dispute about that. We need to make the foreign ministry more resourceful. Then, the ministry will have more capacity and efficiency to handle issues related to security, finance, labour and climate.Why have we failed to maintain reciprocity in terms of diplomats’ relations with the leaders of host countries? For example, our ambassadors in some capitals don’t get to meet the host leaders for years while the foreign envoys in Kathmandu can meet our prime minister and foreign minister directly and instantly.We have to see it from two perspectives. One is the power structure. In international relations, we can see the reflection of the asymmetric power relations between the big powers and other countries. The more developed and resourceful country’s influence in a host country can be seen and felt. Second, despite being an envoy from an underdeveloped or a small country, one can have diplomatic relations based on the principle of sovereign equality. It depends on the individual diplomat as well.In Kathmandu, we often err when dealing with foreign envoys. We have to decide what level of importance to give them. Therefore, some initiatives have been taken to correct and maintain consistency by implementing a diplomatic code of conduct that aims to integrate all activities through the foreign ministry. Foreign envoys will follow the system if we implement it consistently, irrespective of changes in the government. For that, there should be a political understanding at the national level.Let’s move to Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s recent India visit. Though it was mainly to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Indian Prime Minister Modi, he held some important political meetings. What are the takeaways from the visit?The visit was important from bilateral, regional and international perspectives. Traditionally, foreign affairs was described as an extended form of domestic affairs. But these days, international affairs have influence over domestic affairs as well. So such meetings and dialogues at the prime minister’s level are important. They exchanged views in a very cordial atmosphere. Of late, we have maintained bilateral dialogues at the political level on a regular basis and that has helped remove misunderstandings. Our prime minister’s emphasis is to hold bilateral dialogues both at the political as well as diplomatic levels in order to settle differences. India has taken this spirit positively.Second, the two prime ministers discussed how to expedite the implementation of the agreements reached between Nepal and India during Prime Minister Dahal’s official visit a year ago. The issue was discussed during the meeting between Prime Minister Dahal and Indian External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar as well. They also expressed satisfaction over progress in the implementation of bilateral agreements mainly in energy trade, connectivity and investment. In recent years, we have seen progress in investment, economic and trade sectors. Yet we still have some differences on border issues. That is an important and positive development in Nepal-India relations in recent years. In the past, when we had some differences on political, border or other issues, that used to badly affect other aspects of our relations. But now, both the countries agree to resolve outstanding issues through dialogue and our trade and all other affairs are moving ahead smoothly. This is the encouraging part of our relations. But border disputes can sour our relations anytime, right? Is there a sense of urgency to resolve it once and for all?The prime minister is for activating the concerned bilateral mechanisms to resolve such issues. He has also invited Indian Prime Minister Modi to visit Nepal. We can expect the Indian prime minister’s Nepal visit in near future. We can make some progress in resolving some outstanding matters such as border issues during the high level visit. I believe we will move ahead in this direction.Any progress on submitting the report of the Eminent Persons’ Group?During the meetings, the prime minister raised overall bilateral issues that include the matter related to the EPG report. I think once the mechanisms are activated and start working, that will create a situation for the report’s submission.Nepal and Bangladesh are completing homework for greater energy trade. India’s facilitation is a must for that. Is there any progress on securing the southern neighbour’s support for that?Progress in energy cooperation is a major achievement of this tenure of the prime minister. The progress is not limited to the bilateral level but goes to the regional level. A Cabinet committee of the Bangladesh government earlier this month approved a proposal to import 40 megawatts of electricity from Nepal. At present, we will use India’s infrastructure to export energy to Bangladesh. But for the long term there is a plan to build a dedicated transmission line for that. This shows it is not only Nepal that is interested in exporting its energy but other countries in this region are also interested in importing Nepal’s electricity. We have also signed an agreement to build a cross border transmission line with China. The doors are being opened for regional trade of our energy. This development will make India more open to importing energy from Nepal.Why are we failing to expedite projects under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) of China?The economic cooperation between Nepal and China has substantially increased after we joined the BRI framework. So, Nepal has been benefitting from the BRI. We see some concern about the lack of progress on certain infrastructure projects to be built under the BRI framework. In fact, we are in a better position to implement the projects because now we can decide what kind of BRI projects are good for us based on the experience of project development and implementation under the BRI in other countries.We are working to finalise the BRI implementation agreement. Nepal wants to move ahead by signing the implementation agreement and developing the projects. Nepal joined the BRI framework based on its need to diversify trade and connect to the world market. The reality is the same now. So, we need to sign the implementation plan and move ahead as soon as possible. When I attended the Boao Forum a few months ago, I found the Chinese authorities and other stakeholders holding debates to build quality and resilient infrastructure. They also have plans to support the capacity enhancement of human resources and transfer technology in the BRI member countries.People mainly link the BRI with big infrastructure projects such as railway, road and transmission connectivity but there is no significant progress on these fronts. What are the roadblocks?In Nepal, no big infrastructure project has been completed on time, be it the Melamchi drinking project, airports, hydropower or road projects. We haven’t developed the capacity to build big projects, and we don’t envision any plan to operate after building it. So, not only with China but also with other countries and agencies, we have to seek support for small and medium-size projects that we can efficiently build and operate. Also, the third version of the BRI action plan has included building not only big but small and smart projects under the framework. We have to push for that. As we build our capacity, we can gradually take up big projects. For instance, now we can build big hydro projects on our own. It wasn’t the case until some years ago. We developed expertise in hydropower by building many small projects in the past few decades and gradually enhanced our capacity. We have already faced problems in operating the Pokhara and Bhairahawa airports. Is there any progress in taking Chinese support to operate the airports?We have to see both aspects—domestic as well as international use—of the airports. The two airports have helped us upgrade the quality of our domestic air travel as the passengers have benefited due to the upgraded infrastructure. The number of domestic passengers in these airports has increased significantly.It is true that there is no progress in terms of operating them as international airports. The government is studying all possibilities of their use based on their unique features. We are exploring various options in international markets to attract adventure tourists to Pokhara. Chinese stakeholders are also holding some promotional activities in Pokhara. Chinese authorities have told us that they are consulting with their provincial bodies and exploring possibilities to run regular flights to Pokhara. Similarly, the government is mobilising our embassies and other stakeholders in certain countries having a large number of Buddhist tourists to operate flights to Bhairahawa, and we have received some positive responses. I believe we will be able to operate regular international flights from these two airports soon.It’s been eight years since we signed the trade and transit agreement with China, which was touted as a historic deal between the two countries. Why haven’t we been able to implement it?Some symbolic steps have been taken in this period. For instance, a shipment was received from a third country [Vietnam] using a Chinese port in September last year. Similar other initiatives have been taken but these are limited to symbolic gestures. We have to prepare infrastructure and some legal basis to implement the agreements in a more result-oriented way. A bilateral meeting is being held this week. The meeting is likely to discuss how to bring the trade and transit protocol in an effective way. This meeting will discuss various issues faced so far and will also pave the way forward. We have also proposed to form a ministerial-level mechanism to oversee overall bilateral issues. The upcoming meeting will sort out various issues.The Chinese side was conducting a feasibility study of the Keirung-Kathmandu cross-border railway project. What is the progress?There is progress in various projects that we are carrying out with Chinese support. The cross-border railway feasibility study is in the final stage. Likewise, the study on the Chhahare-Tokha tunnel project is ongoing. A Chinese team is arriving to conduct a feasibility study of the Hilsa-Simkot road. A process to award a contract to build a friendly bridge at Hilsa with Chinese grants has begun. A foundation stone will be laid there soon. Also, a study to build the Chilime-Rashuwagadhi-Keirung 220kV cross-border transmission line is beginning soon. \nThe government has decided to make the National ID Card mandatory in order to receive services from government and public institutions. In the first phase, the June 6 Cabinet meeting made the National ID card number mandatory in 28 districts. People including federal lawmakers criticised the decision saying that it was enforced without first distributing the cards. In this context, Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Yubaraj Katel, director general of the Department of National ID and Civil Registration.Let’s begin with a basic question. Why do we need a National ID card while we already have citizenship certificate, driving license, passport and voting card?There is a fundamental difference between a citizenship card and National ID. Citizenship establishes whether you are a citizen of the country and it helps you identify yourself with some basic details. In Nepal, it was also widely used as a service card. Wherever you go, you have to show the citizenship card—to open a bank account or acquire a SIM card for a phone. If we study international practices, there are mainly two cards—one is an identity card and the other is a service card. In 2018, the Nepal government came up with the idea of distributing national identity cards with a unique digital number for each eligible citizen. The number can track not only the individual but also the person’s activities and movements. This project has various components. First is data collection. It has two categories—demographic data, such as the names of father, mother and other family members. Second is biometric data—fingerprints, eye retina and digital signature. The biometric data is crucial to create a unique identity of each individual and avoid duplication in the integrated national database. The National ID has these two types of data. The other tasks are enrollment of the data, printing and distribution of the cards and then providing services based on that. At present, people carry multiple cards in their pockets. The objective of this project is to replace all of them by a single card–National ID. The new card includes vital details of all other cards in its chip with 1GB storage capacity. The government wanted to trace people based on their unique individual numbers so that there is no need to print and carry multiple cards. There is a huge industry of printing separate cards for each and every service that is creating a jumble of information. The National ID will not only replace multiple cards but also help authorities control criminal activities like financial frauds by removing duplication. At present, government authorities have difficulty in tracing and identifying an individual and wrongdoers are benefitting from that situation.What cards will be replaced by the National ID?It has a chip with 1GB storage capacity where you can store your driving license, academic documents, voting card, insurance details, ATM card number, etc. For instance, if you go to a telecom company to acquire a SIM card, they will ask for a copy of your citizenship card. You can say, ‘no, I have a National ID card’. Once you give your number and fingerprint, they can immediately verify it through the system. Another objective is to help people get rid of filling up pages of forms for each service. International governance has a norm that says don’t ask citizens their information more than once. A state agency should seek the information once and provide it to other state agencies if they require it. People complain that many agencies don’t accept National ID. They still ask for a citizenship card for official record and verification. So, in practice, it didn’t help people reduce the number of cards in their pockets. In fact, it added one more.Therefore, the June 6 Cabinet decision made the use of National ID cards compulsory in 28 districts. Now, it is going to be essential to get social security allowances, pensions and claim health insurance. The Health Insurance Board has said it has become challenging for them to verify whether a claimant is the rightful one. The board has 8 million policyholders. We will give them our details. Then, they can cross-check the authenticity of a claimant. This will help avoid huge financial frauds. In fact, the government should have made it mandatory earlier.But people including lawmakers in the federal parliament have strongly opposed the decision saying that the government made National ID mandatory without first distributing the cards to the people.Nepal’s total population is over 30 million. Our principal stakeholders are citizenship card holders. Those 16-year-olds are eligible for citizenship cards. The Election Commission distributes voting cards to those above 18 years. We got the data from the commission and added 20 percent and estimated that we have 18.6 people above 16 years old. As of Friday, we have already distributed the National ID numbers to 14.9 million people. Now, as per our estimate, around 3.7 million people are yet to get the National ID. Millions of people are abroad. Thus, we are headed towards saturation point in terms of data collection and issuance of the numbers. One thing I want to stress is that people don’t need a hard copy of the National ID card. The number is sufficient. Printing cards is costly. We have to pay around 2 euro to procure a blank card. The cost of printing, delivery and other overhead expenses is added to that. With the task of printing over a billion copies of ID cards being too costly, even India discourages use of hard copy of the cards. You can create the QR code of your card, save it in your mobile or print it in a paper and scan it wherever you need it.Officials at our government agencies bring up the rule that makes it mandatory to present a physical copy of citizenship card or other documents for official works.Yes, we are trained and habituated in that way. Now we need to change. We must make offices paperless while developing a strong database system. We have been using citizenship cards to verify the identity of a person for a long time. Biometrics not only helps identify people but also trace their activities. Recently, Rs2 billion was found in the bank accounts of a 26-year-old man. The money was deposited in 56 bank accounts. He used 13 ATM cards and 17 phone numbers. Once the National ID card is implemented, transactions and movements of such wrongdoers will be easily traced and monitored. Identifying individuals accurately is crucial to ensure good governance and strengthen security. Many people have acquired fake citizenship cards. People even made fake passports. Implementation of National ID will control it. It is also related to our national image. It will help improve the status of our passport and add authenticity to our other documents as well.Once the National ID comes into wide use, our details will be traced and used by multiple agencies. State agencies and other institutions benefit from the integrated database as they can easily trace us. But how do you ensure our data isn’t misused and it doesn’t make us insecure?If you have a National ID card, you don’t need a hard copy of your driving licence. There is a backlog of around 2.1 million licences. The government has failed to print and distribute them. We told them, we have already procured 12 million cards. Of them, 3.2 million cards have already been printed and we still need to print around 8 million cards. Once the licence data is integrated with the National ID card, it will be shown there. Now, to come to your question, only the traffic authority can access the licence-related data. The device they use will trace only relevant data. Only an authorised agency will get access to the data and it can’t be used for anything other than the stated purpose. We give access to agencies like Nepal Rastra Bank, Nepal Telecommunication Authority and Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal. Then they regulate the things in their domain. No unauthorised body or individual can access it. Do the implementing agencies have infrastructure to use this technology?We are in a position to implement it in some parts of the country. Therefore, we are implementing it in phases. We are making it mandatory for certain services in 28 districts from mid-July. We should have started much earlier. It must be expedited.Lawmakers said in a Parliament meeting that the decision has ‘terrorised people’ in the 28 districts as locals feared they might be deprived of the services as the government has made National ID cards mandatory without first distributing them.We started the National ID registration process from 2018. Registration teams reached in each local ward except in Mugu and Humla districts of Karnali. It was carried out as a campaign. Even after the drive’s completion, the registration process was open in all the 77 districts, 54 area administration offices and in palika (local unit) centres. We also had registration centres in major downtowns. We receive data of around 4,000 registrations a day. So, there has been sufficient initiative and enough time to encourage people to get the number. Besides, if anyone in the 28 districts are still to get the ID number, they still have three months to register.You said only an ID number but no hard copy was needed to access any kind of service, right?Exactly. There is no provision that states one should produce a hard copy to get any service. You give the number and your biometrics to verify that you are the right person. Then, the official can crosscheck it in the database within seconds.Do all the implementing agencies have the devices that read the National ID cards?We have distributed 4,200 machines that read the cards in 333 local units of the 28 districts. Likewise, we have asked other local units and districts and some agencies such as banks to procure the devices and we have given the specifications based on their requirements. A device costs just around Rs 1,500. You can enter the number and place your thumbprint on it. We have trained relevant officials from all the local units for the purpose.How many cards can the department print at present?We can produce 1,500 cards an hour. But now we are producing only 1,800 a day. We have the strength to distribute 30,000 cards a day but are distributing only 5,000 a day.Again the same question. Then why are people not getting the cards?There is some communication gap. People who registered in 2018 or 2019 haven’t contacted us. We are giving them priority to clear the backlogs. But people who are newly-registered are showing more interest. So, we need to strike the right balance.When will the department be in a position to distribute the cards to all the people?At present, we can print 100,000 cards a month. We have a space to double the capacity. Meanwhile, people have now shown more interest. By enhancing our facilities’ capacity, we can print the pending 8 million cards in the next 40 months.What about election cards? Do we need to register for that and get the voting cards?In fact, the Election Commission doesn’t need to collect data and issue cards. We will talk to them. As a constitutional body, we have to readily make the data available for them. In fact, the National ID Card system can help the commission make voting arrangements for the Nepalis abroad because it can accurately identify the right person and can immediately update the integrated system here in Nepal about the votes cast in any country. This card will be helpful in conducting fair elections because the biometric data stored in this system will be perfect bases to identify the people and instantly update the activities in the database.You have emphasised replacement of other cards by the National ID cards. How long may it take to do so?We plan on giving priority to three sectors—banking, civil aviation and telecom. People right now need to fill separate forms for these services that have irked the service seekers. We have asked the bankers to buy the devices. We as a supplier are ready. Now the stakeholders should be ready too. It will benefit them because it helps control frauds.What if I don’t register for the National ID card?In the first place, you will be deprived of social security funds, pension, insurance policies. Likewise, the government will gradually make the card compulsory to receive many other services such as driving licence, land transaction, telephone numbers, bank accounts. How do you assure that our data stored in this system isn’t misused?See, the current practices make you more vulnerable. Because multiple agencies take your data for various purposes. Do they have a system to protect the data and ensure that it isn’t misused? But when your data is stored only by a dedicated government agency, it will be more secure as the agency is specialised for that. When other authorised agencies seek data, we give them access only to the relevant one. We have a National Identity Management Information System (NIMIS). We have maintained three layers of security—L1, L2, L3—to ensure foolproof security of the data. There are three servers.Are we dependent on any foreign company for any related service?So far, only one international vendor is involved but we are cutting down its involvement as well, with a plan to ultimately replace it by our own agency. The vendor now helps transfer collected data to the printing machine through the Automated Biometric Identification System (ABIS). But our plan is to do so through our own government agency or local vendor. We do all the other tasks. Security printing is done within the office basement where every movement of people is monitored and recorded. \nPrithvi Subba Gurung, deputy general secretary of the CPN-UML, is one of the leaders who strongly lobbied for a federal system while the Constituent Assembly was writing the constitution between 2008 to 2015. Eight years after the adoption of the federal democratic republican constitution, the federal system, particularly the provinces, are widely being criticised for their supposed failure to deliver. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asks former Gandaki chief minister Gurung what went wrong in the course of implementing the federal system.The implementation of the federal system has faced several hurdles since its adoption. Most provinces have for months failed even to form the governments, let alone run them efficiently. Where is the problem?We have adopted a federal system but are working against its spirit. Provinces should run autonomously. On some key issues, federal leaders and the party’s central bodies may give some direction to their provincial bodies. But most provincial activities are still centrally-governed even years after the adoption of federalism. So, our practices aren’t in line with the system. The provincial governments shouldn’t have been affected by the changes in the federal coalition. Such problems were seen in India years ago. But they have learned from their experience. In our case, leaders of major political parties treated the provincial governments as party chapters. The provincial governments are formed and run as per the constitution and all the three tiers of the governments are autonomous. The high commands in our political parties aren’t ready to accept the new constitutional setup.Are the provincial leaders equally responsible as they seek Kathmandu’s nod before taking any important decisions?They seek the centre’s support because they are trained in that way. They are too dependent on the centre. You said India learned by experience and now provinces there work more autonomously. But, in Nepal, provinces are now witnessing more problems than during their first tenure, which is evident also in the difficulties in government formation in multiple provinces. Why couldn’t they learn from the five-year experience?Nepal’s leaders and political parties are still not committed to federalism. They have failed to implement the federal system as per the spirit of the constitution. This is the major problem. The big parties as well as their leaders are guided by a centralised mindset and still prefer working in a unitary system. We should not forget that we transformed the executive and legislative bodies into three tiers of federal systems. But our judiciary retained the old structure. Therefore, the judiciary doesn’t accept the federal system and its practice in a true sense. Its verdicts reflect the same.The role of Speakers and Province Heads has courted controversies in multiple provinces. The top court invalidated some of their decisions. Is it because of lack of clarity, faults in our constitutional provisions, or is it because of the leaders?Speaker and Province Head are political posts created in accordance with constitutional provisions. When overall politics is dirty and unhealthy, those taking up these responsibilities also feel compelled to resort to similar tactics. When overall politics improves, they automatically make better decisions. Mainly there is no leader in the high command who completely owns federalism and is determined to implement it in its true spirit. This government in its policies and programmes unveiled last month had rightly said that “protecting federalism and strengthening the federal democratic republic is our top priority”. But the budget failed to introduce programmes as per the promises made in the policies and programmes.How do we correct these anomalies? Where do we begin?We are in a complex situation. Many have started to float the idea of making amendments to the constitution. But we shouldn’t forget that various forces and stakeholders had their own positions during constitution-making. They made compromises and found middle grounds to promulgate the constitution. If we go for amendments, they all will return to their respective stances. Some may want to revive the Hindu Kingdom while others will stand against it. Some leaders even within Nepali Congress have started to advocate for constitutional monarchy. But we can’t regress to the monarchical system. We can’t renounce secularism and an inclusive democratic system. We can’t backtrack on our commitment to a socialism-oriented system. We may explore some changes in our electoral system or form of governance without going against these key features of our constitution but we can’t destabilise the charter. What are the major flaws to be fixed?There are some. For instance, provinces have no role in education. The responsibility of education up to secondary level is given to the local level. And, everything is controlled by the federal government. The local units are entrusted with key responsibilities such as developing curriculum, overseeing the issues of career developments of teachers and staffers and their promotion as well as transfers etcetera. Local units can’t do all of these things efficiently as they have their own limitations. How can a local unit transfer a teacher from Kaski to Lamjung? Provinces should have been given such responsibilities. The power has been centralised at Singha Durbar. Such is also the situation in other sectors.Though the proportional representation (PR) system is hailed as one of the most beautiful features of our constitution in terms of ensuring inclusion, it has also been blamed for political instability. Many have demanded revision in the electoral system.The major political parties such as the CPN-UML and Nepali Congress have not trained their party members on the proper implementation of key constitutional features such as federalism and electoral system. The party members and general people have either wrongly understood it, or have negative impressions about the systems. These systems were adopted with an objective to resolve our decade-long conflict and address the concerns of the historically marginalised communities and even mainstream some groups through an inclusive democratic system. The idea was to integrate all the communities and maintain unity in diversity. After holding years-long debates on various options, we agreed on the mixed electoral system so as to reflect our diversity in the state agencies.As the proverb goes, “the bad workman blames his tools”, our leaders are blaming the system for their failure to secure a majority by winning people’s trust. Many countries that practise similar electoral systems have progressed. Our electoral system and the form of governance are not causing political instability. Many countries have adopted a parliamentary system and many others have practised the presidential model. Countries have progressed in both the systems. Also, there are examples of failures under both setups. So, the problem lies in our political parties and leaders, not in the systems. Shouldn’t political parties like the UML and Congress work with a plan to secure a majority by winning people’s trust? They aren’t training their focus on that but blaming the system. At times, they have squandered the majority as well and have failed to keep the party intact. Isn’t it our [leaders’] failure?Some argue that the issue of the fractured mandate can be addressed by increasing the threshold ceiling for political parties to be eligible to get PR votes and that can be done by amending election laws. Does it help?This is the idea coming from big political parties because they get more votes when fringe parties disqualify for PR votes. But a higher ceiling may deprive many small parties from representing certain communities. So, this goes against the spirit of inclusion. What we need is a good coalition culture. If we see the trend of recent decades, Indian politicians have become much more mature in this context. In the past, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi accommodated his electoral alliance partners in his ruling coalition even though his party won the majority single-handedly. If we scrap the inclusive electoral system, won’t the marginalised communities again revolt? We should be careful about that.At times, leaders have helped dissident groups split their party. These are the same leaders who issued an ordinance to change the provision that required a group within a political party to show support of 40 percent members of the party’s central committee “and” the parliamentary party. Only then could it split. They changed the threshold to 20 percent, and the “and” provision had been changed to “or”. The provision of requiring 40 percent support on both sides had earlier been included to ensure political stability. But the leaders who are helping party divisions are blaming the system for instability in the country. So, we [leaders] have to mend our ways, not blame the system. The Rastriya Swantantra Party, the fourth-largest in the lower house, has officially said that it wants to overhaul the federal system and drastically downsize the provinces. Also, leaders within the major parties who earlier stood in favour of federalism have started criticising it. On Saturday, Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa said the country can’t sustain the provinces in their present form. What is your view?I am one of those who advocated for a federal system even before the first Constituent Assembly because Nepal is a country full of discrimination based on caste, class, region and religion. We advocated for the system to do away with these discriminations and find a system to maintain unity within diversity. Federalism is the best system to promote national unity as all groups get their own space as per their unique features. For instance, if you make multiple rooms in a building, you can give space and adjust more people. But if you keep many people inside a big room, they will have difficulties—no matter how big the room is. We should strengthen the federal system. We can’t regress.Then, why do many people see provinces as a burden?In Nepal, the federal system was projected as a structure that resulted in huge liability to the state coffers. But the facts don’t substantiate it. A local unit in the federal structure replaced many erstwhile Village Development Committees (VDCs). For instance, in my home district of Lamjung, eight palikas covered the areas of 61 VDCs, and the expenditure of the current eight local units is no more than that of the erstwhile 61 VDCs. Now we don’t need 77 district coordination committees. They can be scrapped. No province needs more than seven ministers. Likewise, the federal Cabinet can be drastically downsized. Why do we need a 25-strong Cabinet at the centre when we already have seven other provincial cabinets? Twelve ministries are enough at the centre, as suggested by the high level commission on administration reform.There are many departments and divisions that were designed under the unitary system that have become completely redundant in the federal setup. So many project offices established over two decades ago based on the needs of that time are still there. These irrelevant bodies should be scrapped. This is how we can significantly cut down on administrative costs. Leaders and people don’t discuss that. They only blame provinces. \nThe weather will be generally to mostly cloudy throughout the country today.According to the Meteorological Forecasting Division, light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is likely to occur at a few places across the nation.

Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nThe preliminary findings of the parliamentary special probe committee investigating crisis-ridden cooperatives suggest that the cooperative sector is on the brink of collapse, according to a committee member.“As the government bodies that were supposed to regulate the cooperatives sector failed to efficiently perform their duties, the situation has now gone beyond our control,” a committee member told the Post on the condition of anonymity. The committee has seven members.“This problem could pose a challenge to the overall economy,” the member further said. “The probe committee is yet to reach its final conclusion.”The special probe committee, which began its work a month ago, reached this assessment after a month-long discussion with top officials from government agencies, as well as chiefs and members of various panels formed so far by the government to look into problems involving cooperatives. The special parliamentary probe, which was formed on May 28, has been given three months to complete its task and submit a report to the government. It held its eleventh meeting on Monday. The cooperatives operating within their defined limits are functioning efficiently, the member said. “However, those that breached their bounds have faced problems.”After weeks of negotiations between the ruling and opposition parties, a seven-member committee led by CPN-UML lawmaker Surya Thapa was constituted to investigate the embezzlement of deposits in dozens of cooperatives across the country. Earlier, the Nepali Congress, the main opposition party, disrupted parliamentary proceedings for months, demanding such a committee. Besides Thapa, other members of the committee are Sarita Bhusal of the UML; Badri Pandey and Ishwari Devi Neupane of the Congress; Lekh Nath Dahal of the CPN (Maoist Centre); Shishir Khanal of the Rastriya Swatantra Party; and Dhruba Bahadur Pradhan of the Rastriya Prajantara Party. The committee had started drafting its work procedures on June 5 and began investigations on June 18.Numraj Khanal, an undersecretary at the Parliament Secretariat, says that until now, the special probe committee has tried to understand the conceptual framework of cooperatives after discussing the issue of misappropriation of cooperatives funds with various stakeholders. “During this period, we have discussed the issue with officials from regulatory bodies of cooperatives and with law enforcement agencies and tried to understand their findings on the matter,” Khanal told the Post. “Likewise, we also have discussed the issue with chiefs and representatives of various commissions the government formed in different times starting since 1990.”From 1990 to 2024, the Nepal government formed at least seven different committees to investigate the cooperatives sector’s problems and recommend solutions. The parliamentary special committee held a discussion with Maha Prasad Adhikari, the governor of Nepal Rastra Bank, on Monday. Governor Adhikari said that the current problem in cooperatives is clearly the result of the government allowing an unlimited number of cooperatives to operate throughout the country, said Surya Bahadur Thapa, the coordinator of the Parliamentary Special Probe Committee.Thapa said that Governor Adhikari pointed out a few more reasons.“Allowing cooperatives to run without defining their geographic boundaries, permitting them to collect deposits without any limit, and lack of effective regulation are some other reasons behind the problems seen in the cooperatives sector,” Thapa quoted Adhikari as saying.Adhikari called for setting up a powerful regulatory body to oversee the sector.The special committee has yet to start investigation into the Gorkha Media Network, though it falls under its jurisdiction. The media company has been accused of rerouting money from various cooperatives to the now dysfunctional Galaxy 4K television, where Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane used to be the managing director.“The panel is yet to study the details related to the Gorkha Media Network,” under-secretary Khanal said.Before this, the committee had on July 4 summoned Secretary of the Ministry of Home Affairs Ek Narayan Aryal, and the Inspector General of Police (IGP) Basanta Bahadur Kunwar, among other officials, to discuss the cooperatives under investigation.Apart from Home Secretary Aryal and IGP Kunwar, Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) Chief Shyam Gyawali and Crime Investigation Department Chief Tek Bahadur Tamang were also invited to the committee on the day.Thapa said they discussed the matter in detail with the home secretary, the IGP, and other senior security officials.According to a member, some committee members grilled IGP Kunwar about his previous statement in the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee. Speaking at the parliamentary committee meeting in the last week of March, the Nepal Police chief had claimed that police had found no evidence of Home Minister Lamichhane’s involvement in cooperatives fraud.“When I made the statement in the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee about the home minister, his involvement in the scam had not been disclosed,” a committee member quoted IGP Kunwar as saying at the special committee meeting.Another member of the probe committee, Shishir Khanal, said the IGP said he was not under any pressure to give a statement about Home Minister Lamichhane. Khanal is a lawmaker from the Lamichhane-led Rastriya Swatantra Party.“The IGP said that he spoke on the basis of facts, and that no information regarding Home Minister Lamichhane’s involvement in the cooperatives scam had been found till the day he made the statement.” In the course of seeking inputs from various stakeholders, the committee on July 2 wrote to all the national political parties seeking their suggestions on how to resolve the cooperatives crisis. Two weeks earlier, the panel had asked nine cooperatives on its list (under Schedule 2 of ToR) to submit details of their financial transactions. The special committee is mandated to investigate troubled cooperatives, their legal and institutional objectives, financial systems, regulations, supervision, and transparency. Another task of the panel is to recommend measures for immediate return of savings to the depositors of the problematic cooperatives identified by the Department of Cooperatives and the crisis-ridden cooperatives management committee.  \nAs heavy monsoon rains cause chaos across the country, dengue cases are surging in several districts, including Kathmandu.According to the Health Office Kathmandu, around 18 people are infected with the dengue virus every day. Officials, however, admit that this number could be just the tip of the iceberg, as the office gets reports only from 18 health facilities.“Yes, the number of people infected with the dengue virus could be several times higher than suggested by the reports we are getting every day,” said Dr Arjun Sapkota, chief of the Health Office, Kathmandu. “We are working to make daily reporting of dengue cases mandatory for private health facilities as well.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vectors also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus, according to the World Health Organisation.According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,432 people from 73 districts have been infected with the virus since January this year. Among the 73 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases with 159, followed by Jhapa with 120, Chitwan 83, Makawanpur 65, Tanahun and Doti 49 cases each, and Okhaldhunga and Sindhupalchowk 46 each.Sapkota informed that his office has sensitised the local bodies about the looming risk of a massive dengue outbreak in the coming days.“Mandatory reporting of dengue cases every day is among the preventive measures through which we can identify dengue hotspots,” said Sapkota. “This will help health workers target such measures in particular areas. Additionally, starting this week, we are resuming the “10 minutes at 10 am” initiative every Friday, during which mosquito breeding grounds will be destroyed.”Officials informed that several local units, including the Kathmandu Metropolitan City, have already started preventive measures against dengue. Dengue symptoms include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes. Patients with these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and proper medical care can prevent death.Doctors say many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and can be treated with paracetamol at home.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district. Since then, an increasing number of dengue infections, including major outbreaks, have been reported from many districts. Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Though the post-monsoon period is considered the dengue epidemic season, the deadly disease has already become endemic in Nepal, as outbreaks are reported every month, including in the winter months.According to health workers, storage places for scrap materials, discarded cups, plastic material tossed in open spaces, and unused lands will be potential hotspots for the dengue virus in the coming days. Health workers have warned the owners of these sites that action will be taken if mosquito larvae are found there.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects, such as plastic cups and bottles, could be breeding grounds for these mosquitoes. \nThe government last week raised the minimum support price for paddy by more than 6.5 percent for the harvest of the next fiscal year, 2023-24, soon after the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led administration was reduced to a minority.This was the second time the government fixed the minimum support price during the paddy transplantation period. The Ministry of Commerce and Supplies tabled the proposal to increase the price, which was approved by the Cabinet meeting on July 4.The government decided to increase the minimum support price of common paddy to Rs3,580.62 per quintal (Rs35.80 per kg), up 6.50 percent. Similarly, the floor price for ‘mota dhan’ has been increased to Rs3,410.51 per quintal (Rs34.10 per kg), up 6.64 percent.The minimum support price is the lowest legal price that farmers receive for their harvests. The government does not fix the floor price of fine paddy.A minimum support price is an intervention by the government to protect farmers against sudden slumps in market prices. It is the rate at which the government buys farm produce when no other buyers are in the market.Usually, it is announced in time for farmers to make their production plans before the beginning of the planting season. Under the scheme, the government has to buy a certain amount of the total paddy harvest.In 2012, the government announced the resumption of the policy of fixing the minimum price following complaints that middlemen had been determining the market rate.Until 1999, the minimum support price for paddy and wheat would be announced regularly.According to reports, the practice was fully abandoned that year after the government launched the 20-year Agriculture Perspective Plan.Even when the minimum support price was announced, it was irrelevant as it was set well below the projected market price to protect the government from having to buy farm products should prices tumble.Moreover, reports said that even when support prices were announced, it was not done in time.The policy was irregular.In 2016-17, the minimum support price was announced in mid-November. In 2017-2018, the Cabinet sent back the supplies ministry's proposal. In 2021-22, the government announced the minimum support price for paddy on November 3, which is harvest time. The price was raised by 8 percent.On different occasions, members of parliamentary committees have criticised the government policy as ‘absurd’ because it was announced after many farmers had already harvested and sold their crops. Lawmakers said that the minimum support price was supposed to encourage farmers to boost output, but the government-fixed floor price had ‘discouraged’ them instead.It was only since the last fiscal year that the government announced the price before the transplantation season started.Paddy is transplanted in June and harvested by the end of October.This year, as of Sunday, paddy transplantation has been completed on 539,766 hectares as of Sunday, which is 38.6 percent of Nepal's 1.39 million hectares of paddy fields.Tilak Raj Chaulagain, a senior agro economist at the Department of Agriculture, said that the paddy transplantation rate was slightly lower (by 4 percent) compared to the same period last year. This year, the monsoon entered Nepal from the east on June 10, three days ahead of its usual onset date, according to the Meteorological Forecasting Division.Chaulagain said that the monsoon arrived on time, but it took time to be active. “As a result, transplantation was delayed slightly in the hills, but this will not affect production or productivity.\"According to Chaulagain, while transplantation on the hills is nearing completion, it will pick up pace in Tarai from mid-July. The Tarai, the largest paddy-producing region in the country, accounts for 71 percent of the total rice acreage. The hills account for 25 percent, and the mountain region for 4 percent.“Since there are no reports of a shortage of chemical fertilisers this year, we expect transplantation to be completed within a month and a half at this pace,” said Chaulagain.According to the department, Madhesh has the lowest translation rate of all provinces. In Madhesh province, which commands the lion’s share of the paddy fields, transplantation has been completed on 97,851 hectares, which is 25.5 percent of the 383,150 hectares available paddy fields in the province. Nepal’s economic well-being is closely tied to the rainy season. Rainwater is the lifeblood of Nepal's Rs5.70 trillion economy, which relies heavily on agriculture, with nearly two-thirds of the farmlands being rain-fed.During the four months of June to September, a large part of the country receives nearly 80 percent of its annual rainfall.The production of food grain, mainly rice, depends on the amount and distribution of monsoon rainfall over the country. The monsoon rains also replenish groundwater and reservoirs critical for drinking and power generation. \nThe Nepali fashion market is currently flooded with fast fashion imports and dominated by wear-and-throw clothing. In this somewhat bleak scene, Sangram, a fashion brand with its atelier located in Maharjgunj, stands out by offering a refreshing change to the Nepali fashion scene with its beautifully designed elevated basics that are sustainably made and impeccably tailored.The brand’s collections, vision, and creative direction set it apart. Its memorability is enhanced by its intuitive, artistic photoshoots, where models stand straight and stare intensely into the camera, reminiscent of Marcelo Gaia’s New York-based brand Mirror Palais. Unlike Mirror Palais’s dreamy fashion shoots, which feature ivory backgrounds and fairytale-like clothing, Sangram takes a melancholic approach. The photographs adopt a dark hue, and the models display grim expressions.In one of its shoots titled ‘Incoherency’, photographed by Mirage Gurung, the brand offers viewers a visual feast. The photos feature three models, with the central figure adorned in an extravagant, voluminous neon orange dress and a large, ruffled mask.The interplay of the models’ gazes, or lack thereof, creates stunning visual poetry. The brand’s collections are varied and diverse, but the mood of the photographs is usually consistent, representing Sangram as a brand visually.The brand has also ventured into filmmaking to showcase its collections. In the short film ‘Ghar’, clothing is showcased ingeniously, despite its promotional intent. It is refreshing to see how meaning, intention, and artistry are woven into Sangram’s brand identity through its elaborate photoshoots and dedicated films in the Nepali fashion scene. Sandesh Sangram Rai, 28, the founder and creative director of the brand, launched it during the Covid-19 pandemic. Previously an anthropology student, he brings more than just fashion to the table. This is evident through the brand's recently ended exhibition, which offered a unique wearable experience featuring capsule wardrobes and designs inspired by concurrent art pieces.The exhibition was immersive and intuitive, engaging both individual and collective consciousness. It explored themes like mental health and femininity while also addressing fashion waste. This was achieved not just by acknowledging the existence of fashion waste, but by ensuring minimal waste and sustainability practices in the exhibition itself. Rai, the founder, explained why he chose Khapinchhen Tole for the exhibition instead of other art museums or clubs. Influenced by the Kirat Kipat system, where communities unite for common goals without hidden agendas, the exhibition embodies this spirit of collective effort and altruism. Local women served Newari food throughout the exhibition, and community members supported its construction. Rai added, “Khapinchhen is deeply rooted and welcoming, and to receive permission to create art in such a historic and beautiful space was truly special for us.”The exhibition featured capsule collections based on artworks by Mina Garbuja, Suruchi BK, Suza Magar, Yanjan Kumar Joshi, and Sandesh Sangram Rai. Garbuja’s collection was centred around the art piece ‘Tied Up Femininity’, featuring traditional laccha dori. These laccha dori contain notes written by women sharing stories of the challenges faced while growing up as girls. Visitors were encouraged to add their own notes, reflecting on their journey from girlhood to adulthood or sharing personal stories, including experiences of sexual abuse if they wish, and hang them on the laccha dori.According to Garbuja, her clothing collection, inspired by the art piece, focused on clean lines, subtle details, and minimal, toned-down colours. She incorporates pleats, draping, and straps as the primary design elements in women’s clothing, referencing the concept of dori or laccha dori in her capsule collection. Suza Magar’s collection was inspired by an art piece titled ‘Nightmare and Paranoia’. This piece features a stark, cold bunk bed adorned with red yarn. This immersive installation invites visitors to sleep on the bed and experience the discomfort of having yarn near their faces, recreating the unsettling feeling associated with nightmares.Magar’s collection embraced this theme by incorporating textured fabrics, nets, pleats, and prints designed to evoke feelings of unease and vulnerability in the wearer.Yanjan Kumar Joshi’s capsule collection was inspired by an art piece, but he interprets it differently from what initially meets the eye. According to him, “This installation represents the artist's mind as a chaotic mess, but also as a comforting meadow where inspiration and joy are found.”His collection features reused buttons as appliqués, minimal fabric wastage, and versatile, unisex designs.Sandesh Sangram Rai adds that the scrap fabrics will be reused and upcycled to create other materials. He further explains that salvaged and previously unused muslin fabric will also be repurposed.Rai underscores that all materials used in the exhibition will focus on reuse or upcycling, highlighting the brand’s commitment to sustainability and minimal waste.Another captivating art piece, titled ‘Wrapped up in my Ama’s Saree’, showcases numerous sarees suspended from the ceiling, forming an elaborate and visually engaging installation. This piece explores the notion that societal norms can restrain individuals, with the sarees symbolising the burdens imposed by societal ills.Suruchi BK’s collection drew inspiration from this art piece. In her designs, she creatively utilises upcycled sarees to craft innovative pieces. This approach not only breathes new life into unused sarees but also addresses the issue of waste in fashion.The exhibition was divided into two floors: one showcasing the art pieces alongside the clothing collections, while the top floor featured a changing room and items from Sangram’s previous collections.This setup aptly earned the exhibition its title as a ‘wearable exhibition’, allowing visitors to select clothes they like, try them on, and experience the garments as art pieces themselves. This approach underscores their innovative integration of clothing displays and art exhibitions.Like previous photography and filmmaking campaigns, the exhibition integrated various art forms into fashion, imbuing it with deeper significance. It adopted a runway approach without the traditional runway setting by allowing each garment to convey a meaningful story accompanied by art installations.The clothes presented in the exhibition are available for purchase. \nThe monsoon has been causing havoc right across Nepal in the past couple of days. At least 70 people have been killed in floods, landslides and other monsoon-related disasters since June 10, according to the Nepal Police. Five others were missing and 86 people were injured in water-induced disasters over a month. There must have been many other incidents not included in official records. The monsoon entered Nepal from its eastern part in the second week of June. Heavy rainfalls that caused huge damage in Bagmati, Gandaki and Lumbini provinces until Sunday, wreaked havoc in far-western Nepal on Monday.As a country with over 83 percent of its land covered by hills and mountains, Nepal is always at the risk of landslides and floods mainly in the monsoon period. Similarly, people in the southern belt are tormented by inundation. Monsoon-related disasters are a yearly occurrence. The Monsoon Preparedness and Response Plan 2024 estimated that over 412,000 households may be affected and of them over 83,000 are likely to be badly hit by monsoon-related disasters this season. In a decade between April 2014 to April 2024, there were 1,602 recorded floods and 2,840 landslides. At least 3,052 people were killed, 791 went missing and 4,176 were injured in the period, according to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority. Similarly, 16,054 buildings and other structures were damaged. This shows the magnitude of the losses caused by monsoon-related disasters in the country.As heavy rains have battered almost all parts of the country, a large number of people have been struggling to deal with the disasters. Besides deaths, missing and injuries, thousands have been displaced and taking shelter in nearby places. In such times, saving lives by rescuing people trapped in difficult situations should be the government’s first priority. Logically, what follows is shifting people from disaster-prone areas to safer places, swiftly distributing reliefs and working on a plan to rehabilitate the displaced. Though our three security agencies often do a commendable job of saving people’s lives, they are still not well-equipped. Just months ago, some of them died while trying to contain wildfires. Rescuers should be equipped with better gears and other logistics before they set out on rescue missions. Moreover, relief distribution and rehabilitation works often court controversy either because of substandard quality of the goods distributed, or the irregularities while carrying out the task.When it comes to rehabilitating flood victims, our state agencies have utterly failed. Thousands of people have been languishing in either nearby forest areas, on riverbanks or other unsafe places for years where they had supposedly been shifted for a few months. For instance, floods in Koshi in August 2008 displaced 7,563 families from the present-day Shreepur, Haripur, and West Kushaha, located across different wards of Koshi Rural Municipality. But they are still living in makeshift huts and mud houses as the government has failed to properly rehabilitate them in the past 16 years. The Koshi Flood Victims Struggle Committee is fighting for their basic rights. A state that cannot ensure the basic safety of its citizens, we are afraid, has gotten its priorities badly wrong.    \nA week ago, on July 2, at midnight, Nepali Congress president Sher Bahadur Deuba and Communist Party of Nepal-UML chairperson KP Sharma Oli struck a deal to form an alliance to rule the country. The two largest parties in Parliament secretly agreeing to form a ruling coalition is an anomaly for any democracy. More worryingly, the nation is still kept in the dark about the terms of the agreement.What do they have to hide? From whom? Why? As The Kathmandu Post observed immediately, this secrecy is “a sign of dishonesty” amongst the ruling elites. It’s legitimate to suspect why they would conceal the agreement for so long if there was nothing controversial or sinister about it. The Canadian novelist Gilbert Parker said, “In all secrets there is a kind of guilt, however beautiful or joyful they may be…secrecy means evasion, and evasion means a problem to the moral mind.” The oppressed are beginning to worry that the deal is a conspiracy against them, that it will bolster Brahmanism and curtail their rights and privileges. Achievements under threat?Many of the oppressed and their allies suspect that the deal between the Congress and the UML leadership includes agendas such as the following: (i) the abolition of federalism (ii) the reinstatement of the Hindu nation (iii) the termination of proportional representation in the elections, and (iv) end of the caste-based quota system. A mix of internal and external factors seems to have contributed to the mainstream party leaders, their MPs and other influential politicians desiring the above-mentioned changes. For one thing, almost all the major players in the corridors of power are high-caste Hindu men from the hills who have naturally been unhappy with the declaration of Nepal as a secular state. The fact that the constitution has betrayed the very meaning of secularism—by openly stressing the promotion and preservation of the Hindu religion as a central goal of secularism—has not satisfied the conservative Hindu minds. These strongly religious and traditional people dominate not just the government and parties but all the state bodies, including the judiciary, army and police. No wonder, a significant number of Nepali Congress MPs recently wrote to their party leadership asking for a return of the Hindu nation. A few Dalit MPs, too, joined the call for a Hindu nation—without perhaps realising how much self-harm their action is likely to do. There’s a similar Hindubadi sentiment amongst many communist politicians. Dr Ambedkar was right when he noted that upper-caste Hindus cannot be true communists!Another possible factor responsible for initiating the aforementioned regressive steps is the risk of the king’s return. Parties are understandably concerned about monarchy making a comeback as a consequence of their own poor governance. In the short term, there’s also the chance of the monarchist force, Rastriya Prajatantra Party, making electoral gains due to the unpopularity of the mainstream parties. So, perhaps the two biggest parties opted to return to, in essence, the constitution of 1991, albeit without the monarchy. They may have seen this as the only feasible way to preserve their hold in a fast-changing society against the onslaught of both the monarchists and the populists. The latter has, in fact, posed a bigger threat than the royalists in recent years. Equally powerful seems to be the external factor: The Hindu nationalist pressure from India. The return of Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party to power may have forced the parties to concede to Delhi’s demand to reinstate Nepal as the world’s only Hindu nation.No matter how much he desires, Prime Minister Modi cannot turn his own country into an officially Hindu state. But Nepal may be coerced to that end. He can easily exert great pressure on a small and weak neighbour like Nepal, which is also invariably ruled by upper-caste Hindus. The current geopolitical situation may have emboldened Modi’s resolve to revive Nepal as a Hindu nation. The Western powers, mainly the United States of America and Europe, do have some influence in Nepal as bilateral and multilateral donors. However, these powers have lost their moral high ground because of their blind support to the Jewish and apartheid state of Israel in its genocide of the Palestinians. Dark days ahead?I hope my speculations will turn out to be completely wrong. But more and more members of the Dalit and ethnic minority communities have become increasingly nervous about what may be coming. Many members of these communities who are aligned with the Congress and the UML, too, feel that the days ahead do not look good. If you mix Hindu nationalist politics with the already deeply embedded cultural Hinduism, all you get is a society that is much more casteist and bigoted, i.e., more intolerant towards Dalits, tribal groups, religious minorities and Muslims in particular. Officially, a Hindu state means an officially caste apartheid state—a Brahmanist, Manubadi state. This is crystal clear. Then, the Manubadi laws will further overshadow modern and secular laws, thus emboldening orthodox and conservative Hindu elements. Caste discrimination and untouchability will become much more accepted, if not encouraged, in society.Likewise, ending the federal system is tantamount to bulldozing the ethnic identity and rights of ethnic and/or indigenous communities. At a time when some people are still clamouring for ethnic identity—as we’ve recently seen in eastern Nepal, including the parliamentary elections in Ilam, as well as the ongoing anti-cable-car movement in Pathivara temple—the new Oli regime will be doing everything possible to further divide and weaken ethnic activism. Getting rid of the little privileges and benefits we’ve been receiving through the quota system will be another disaster. Suppose the Oli and Deuba regimes choose to implement the recommendations made by the Inclusion Commission (which exclusively comprises Bahun officials), the quota allocations will be made purely based on class. This means the lower classes from the upper castes will reap much of the benefits, and the current outrage from certain quarters on the reservation to Dalits will vanish.In the endIt’s not yet known what issues Deuba and Oli have agreed upon—but whatever it is, it doesn’t look good. It seems surreal and potentially dangerous to our future. Why would they hide the agreement if it wouldn’t cause some sort of unhappiness amongst some communities? The leaders’ likely goal is to keep the majority happy, which often means pandering to the interests of the traditional and conservative upper castes and those of the orthodox neighbours. This often entails curtailing the already limited rights and privileges of the oppressed groups. Yet, I’d say, let’s not despair! We should, however, remain watchful. The contents of the mysterious bag will be out in the open sooner or later. If the septuagenarian leaders attempt to further destroy us and deny our dignity and rights, it may give rise to a new opportunity for the divided and disillusioned peoples to come together. The government may thus indirectly encourage Dalits, Janajatis, Madhesis and other marginalised groups to unite and fight.  \nIn the early 1980s, Nepal’s firebrand communist leader, Mohan Bikram Singh, split from his comrade Nirmal Lama to establish a radical political alternative. Lama and Singh had earlier revolted from the Communist Party of Nepal to establish their own faction after the party’s fourth convention in 1974. Among Singh’s trusted leaders were Mohan Baidya, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, CP Gajurel and Dev Gurung. But Singh was forced to spend most of the following years politically exiled in India. As a result, Baidya effectively captured the party, renaming it the Communist Party of Nepal (CPN), “Mashal,” pronounced slightly different from Lama’s CPN “Masal.” However, Baidya and many senior party leaders faced self-imposed demotion after the party suffered a strategic setback in the now infamous ‘Sector Scandal’. Baidya was forced to nominate Dahal as the party leader in 1989, a position Dahal has held for three and a half decades.During the first two decades of his leadership, Dahal reigned supreme, as his party led the country into a decade-long violent political conflict that claimed, by some estimates, over 16,000 lives. Despite substantial economic and political costs, the conflict accelerated Nepal’s transition from a semi-feudal society with an exclusive political system into a more inclusive and secular republic. To that end, the Dahal-led Maoist party received due recognition through a popular mandate of the 2008 first Constituent Assembly elections. But Dahal’s unnecessary distrust of Nepal’s more established political parties, which had played a considerable role in bringing his party back into the political mainstream, made him commit blunders and unseated him from a comfortable majority government. His suspicion against fellow comrades who questioned his leadership style and decisions led to multiple splintering of the Maoist party. An insecure leaderDespite leading the country in and out of a transformative political conflict and becoming one of the key signatories of the new constitution, Dahal has remained an insecure leader who takes every opportunity to remind the Nepali people and the world about his “revolutionary contributions”. Possibly, this deep-seated insecurity emerges from the fact that he is neither seen as an intellectually gifted politician like his fellow comrade Baburam Bhattarai, who is known as an ideologue of the Maoist conflict or as a leader with integrity and simplicity like that of his political gurus Singh and Baidya. The thought of losing the political legacy of the ‘People’s War’ despite clinging onto the leadership of the party must constantly haunt the Maoist supremo.Dahal’s insecurity and political hypocrisy were also palpable in the way he derided the Madhesh Movement, which also raised the agendas of federalism and inclusion. Instead of considering them allies, Dahal ordered his party cadres to attack the Madheshi party leaders and their cadres. A large part of the political onus of escalating the tensions leading to the unfortunate Gaur massacre in 2007 will always rest on Dahal. Over the past decade and a half, Dahal has repeatedly failed to display the leadership he is ironically fond of discussing. Despite mobilising thousands of Tharu youths during the conflict, he failed to support their genuine claims on provincial boundaries during the federal structuring. And despite claims of his ‘one-sided love’ for Madhesh, he remained silent as more than 50 Madhesi protesters were indiscriminately killed by the security forces in 2015. Unreliable coalition partnerThere was a time when Dahal led a party that had shaken the country’s political core. Less than two decades later, he now leads a party that has mostly eroded its political base and only relies on a stronger coalition partner to remain relevant. But has Dahal even proved to be a reliable coalition partner? Let’s take a closer look. After Baidya split the party in 2012, the CPN-Maoist was reduced to the third position in the second Constituent Assembly elections, a significant loss from its commanding majority in the first CA. In the following two years, Dahal’s party was not only kept out of power but also forced to endorse a constitution that the Nepali Congress and rival communist party CPN-UML tabled. Having lost the capacity to dictate the political course, Dahal resorted to coalition politics. When the opportunity came, he supported UML’s Khadga Prasad Oli to cobble up a coalition government in October 2015. However, when the Nepali Congress offered him to lead a new coalition, he abandoned Oli and became Prime Minister in 2016. With the 2017 elections on the horizon, Dahal knew his party would not be able to compete with the larger parties that had successfully led the constitution drafting. With some active external mediation, Dahal persuaded Oli for an electoral alliance and even agreed to an eventual unification of the communist forces. When the left unity won a landslide victory, Dahal was convinced that Oli would honour the agreement to hand over power to him mid-way through the four-year period. When Oli refused, he split the united CPN in 2020, convincing several disgruntled leaders like Madhav Nepal to abandon the party and join a coalition with the Nepali Congress. The new coalition also offered Dahal and his party a comfortable division of electoral seats in the 2022 local, provincial and federal elections. But soon after the elections were over, Dahal bargained for power with both Deuba and Oli. Despite having won only 32 seats in the federal parliament with only 11 percent popular vote, Dahal managed to become Nepal’s 33rd Prime Minister in December 2022.Impending downfallIn 2014, political analyst CK Lal had told me that Dahal’s political opportunism would make him relevant in Nepali politics for at least another decade. The Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML took exactly a decade to realise that Dahal had been cashing in on Nepal’s fractured politics. This week, the two parties agreed that Nepal’s long-term political stability requires an introspection into the present electoral system, which allows electorally less popular outfits to dictate the course of national politics. So, not only have the two large parties decided to pull the plug on the Dahal government, but they also agreed to form an independent commission to study and propose amendments to the current electoral provision.While there is little disagreement that the current electoral system paved the way for more representation of the hitherto marginalised sections, the opportunity to correct inefficacies like expensive election campaigning and manipulation of the proportional candidacy lists by the parties must not be dismissed either. There are also serious doubts about the intention of the two parties to strike a deal at a time when the Nepal Police and the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority are investigating some high-profile corruption cases. It is up to the two parties to vindicate their intent by ensuring that the new political course does not interfere in these investigations. And even if the two parties agree to amend the constitutional provisions regarding elections, they will need to gather a national consensus or at least a two-thirds majority. Whatever happens in the next few weeks and months, it is evidently clear Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s eventual political downfall is on the horizon. \nThe text of the midnight deal last Monday whereby the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML agreed to stitch together a new coalition remains hidden, giving rise to much speculation. Yet while talking about the deal, the leaders of the two parties have pointed to the necessity of a ‘national consensus’ government in order to address the country’s pressing problems. This, they say, entails amending the nine-year-old national constitution. Even if the country’s two largest parties come together, they will fall short of a two-thirds majority needed to amend the constitution in the federal lower House. Had they the numbers in the lower chamber, they would have fallen short in the upper House. To amend the constitution, the ruling parties ought to have two-thirds majority in both. This is why many analysts reckon the constitution amendment is no more than an excuse to justify the toppling of the Pushpa Kamal Dahal government. That is unfortunate. The biggest architects of the national charter cannot be so cavalier when it comes to its amendment.The other suspicion is that in pushing for constitution amendment, the two big parties want to significantly reduce the number of proportional representation seats in the two Houses. The reasoning is that the PR seats have allowed many smaller political outfits to enter parliament and to bargain for power with the big parties, thus contributing to political instability. The Congress and the UML also seemingly want to capitalise on the perception that the PR seats are mostly reserved for those close to powerful party chairs rather than for members of the marginalised and under-represented communities, as was envisioned in the constitution. Whatever the case, they should tread carefully. Despite all its flaws, the PR system has significantly increased the political representation of marginalised communities and groups and it would be dangerous to fiddle with it without their buy-in. There is also no guarantee a fully FPTP system will ensure stability. Even before the new constitution came into effect in 2015, not a single government, each one of them formed through direct elections, came close to serving out its full term. This again points to the need for broad consultations—and not a little introspection on the part of our top leaders. A living document that is the constitution can and should be amended on a timely basis, or it becomes irrelevant. But hastily tweaking it could invite more problems than it would solve. It is interesting that many of the high-ranking Congress and UML leaders were unaware of the Monday deal even an hour before it was signed. It is thus hard to believe that the points of agreement were much discussed even inside the two parties, much less in the broader society. For far too long, the leaders of the big parties have treated the apparatus of government pretty much as their personal property. The biggest reason the new federal republican system has not functioned as intended is their sense of entitlement, lack of accountability, and paucity of faith in the system they have themselves championed in public. Unless there is a change in this mindset, no system of governance or election will yield the desired results.  \nThe weather across the country is forecast to be partly to generally cloudy on Tuesday.  Light to moderate rain accompanied by thunder and lightning is expected in several regions, including Koshi Province, Madesh Province, Gandaki Province, and Lumbini Province. Similar conditions may occur sporadically in other parts of the country. The meteorological forecasting division has warned of heavy rainfall in some parts of Koshi, Madhesh, and Gandaki Provinces. Tonight, the weather is expected to remain generally cloudy throughout the country, with light to moderate rainfall. Likewise, moderate rain with thunder and lightning is likely to occur at some places in Koshi Province, Madesh Province, Gandaki Province, and Lumbini Province, as well as at one or two other places in the rest of the country.Heavy rainfall is expected in Koshi, Madesh, Gandaki, and Lumbini Provinces, with the possibility of very heavy rainfall in parts of Koshi Province. The maximum temperature on Monday was recorded at 36.6 degrees Celsius in Janakpur, while Jomsom’s lowest recorded temperature was 14.0 degrees Celsius. \nRussian President Vladimir Putin welcomed Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi late on Monday and toured him around his residence outside Moscow ahead of official talks in the Kremlin on Tuesday.Putin embraced the Indian leader at his home at Novo-Ogaryovo, greeted him as his “dear friend” and said he was “very happy” to see him, according to an account by Russia’s TASS state news agency.“Our official talks are tomorrow, while today in this comfortable, cozy setting we can probably discuss the same issues, but unofficially,” TASS quoted Putin as saying.The Russian president offered Modi, who is on his first visit to Russia in five years, tea, berries and sweets and took him on a tour of the grounds in a motorised cart.Modi’s trip to Moscow and India’s relationship with Russia amid the war that Russia has been waging against Ukraine raise concerns, the US State Department said.Thousands of people have died on both sides since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. India, which has enjoyed a close relationship with Moscow for decades has refused to condemn Russia for the war, instead calling for an end to the conflict through dialogue and diplomacy.Russian state news agencies said Putin and Modi visited the residence’s stable and watched a show with performing horses.A top Indian official said last week that fixing India’s trade imbalance with Russia and securing the discharge of Indian citizens who were “misled” into fighting in the Ukraine war would be among Modi's top priorities in Moscow.India, which has links with Moscow dating from the Soviet era, has increased purchases of cheap Russian oil to record levels. \nAjal Kaji Tamrakar set a new national record in men’s 100 metres butterfly at the First Nepal Aquatics Championship on Monday.Tamrakar took 59.17 seconds at the Heating Swimming Pool in Satdobato, Lalitpur to shatter Anubhav Subba’s record of 59.77 seconds set during the 25th National Open Swimming Competition in 2022.It is Tamrakar’s second national record at the competition after he swam 25.52 seconds to break the men’s 50 metres butterfly record on Saturday. His 25.52 bettered his own previous record of 25.67 seconds he set during the 26th National Open Swimming Competition last year.A total of three national records have been set at the competition.On Saturday, Diwakar Awale made a new record in the men’s 200 metres breaststroke.

The ordinance was later presented in the Parliament and endorsed by both Houses. \nTwo teenage girls drowned and another went missing in a flood in Kanchanpur district on Monday.Superintendent of Police Chakraraj Joshi of Kanchanpur District Police Office said two 15-year-old girls drowned near their homes in Punarbas Municipality-5.The whereabouts of the missing girl are still unknown, and police are actively searching for her. Police said a 12-year-old girl, who was accompanying them, managed to escape.According to the police, they drowned on a flooded road while moving from one neighbourhood to another in the village.Continuous rain for the past two days has submerged most areas of Kanchanpur. Floods in rivers, including the Mahakali, have displaced 900 families in the district. According to the Kanchanpur District Police Office, 3,293 members of 891 households were relocated to safer locations as of Monday morning.Earlier on Sunday, a seven-month-old infant drowned in Krishnapur Municipality after floodwaters entered his house, while a 23-year-old man from Beldandi Rural Municipality-3 went missing after being swept away by the Chaudhar river. \nIn 2019-20, Nepal imported 236 units of passenger electric vehicles (EVs) from China worth some Rs674 million. In the past five years, imports of EVs from China jumped 35 times, suggesting EV adoption in Nepal is now outpacing that of conventional combustion vehicles which use engines that burn fossil fuels, such as petrol or diesel. The EVs have overtaken conventional combustion vehicles.The imports of fossil fuel-consuming passenger vehicles were 10,310 units worth Rs9.24 billion in 2019-20. After four years, in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, imports of conventional combustion vehicles were down to 3,537 units worth Rs4.21 billionHowever, overall vehicle imports have jumped from Rs65.02 billion in 2019-20 to Rs80 billion in the first 11 months of 2023-24.According to the Department of Customs, Nepal imported 11,466 units of EVs worth Rs29 billion in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, or by mid-June. The imports were 3,870 units worth Rs11.23 billion in the same period last fiscal year. Of the total EV imports, a third came from China. Customs data show that Nepal imported 7,931 units of EVs from China, accounting for 69 percent of the total EV imports in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year. This translates to Rs21 billion in value.After China, the majority of EVs were imported from India. In the review period, imports from India amounted to Rs6 billion, or 3,277 units. Until the last fiscal year, India was Nepal’s top EV supplier.The data show that Nepal imported 2,205 EVs worth Rs5.94 billion from India in the last fiscal year. In the same period, imports from China were 1,269 units worth Rs3.75 billion.Nepal’s imports of EVs jumped sharply by 158.23 percent in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year. Importers say BYD, a Chinese multinational, has taken over the Nepali market. The government collected revenue of Rs13.06 billion from the import of EVs in the review period.Akash Golchha, senior vice president of the Nepal Automobile Dealers Association, said the ongoing economic slowdown has not stopped Nepalis from buying EVs. However, petrol or diesel-run vehicle sales could have been better.EV sales and orders saw a dramatic surge before the budget was announced on May 28. Cimex Inc Pvt Ltd, the authorised distributor of BYD Auto Industry Co Ltd in Nepal, said it had achieved a milestone by delivering 50 cutting-edge BYD EVs in a single day on May 18. According to the company, all 50 units were sold from its service centre at Guheshwari, Kathmandu.According to Cimex, the company imported 4,000 EVs in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year. The import of Chinese EVs is high due to their larger production compared to India, said the company, which is among the top EV brands in Nepal.BYD’s Atto and Dolphin are the most preferred models among Nepali customers. With the recent hike in excise and customs duties, the company said the new price list of BYDs will be unveiled soon.“There was fear among buyers that the government may raise duty on EVs in the budget. As a result, the demand surged dramatically,” said Golchha. “The high import increased the stock of EVs.”Automobile dealers said that the government hiked the duty on EVs by 10 percent in the budget for the coming fiscal year 2024-25, which, however, may not impact the sales.Golchha said the government did not make drastic changes in the import duty of EVs in the budget, which may help EV sales boom in the coming days. “The EV demand will grow at a faster pace.”Auto dealers say the import boost for EVs is mainly due to banks’ easy financing. Banks lend up to 90 percent of the vehicle’s cost.Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun, in the annual budget for the upcoming fiscal year, revised the customs and excise duty rates on the import of EVs. The customs duty on EVs of up to 50 kW has been increased to 15 percent from 10 percent, while a 5 percent excise duty has been imposed on them.Likewise, the government increased the customs and excise duties on EVs of 50-100 kW by 5 percent. As per the revised tariffs, the customs duty has been increased to 20 percent from 15 percent, while the excise duty has been increased to 15 percent from 10 percent.The customs duty on 100-200 kW has been raised to 30 percent from 20 percent. Similarly, those in categories 200-300 kW and more than 300 KW will be subject to customs duty of 60 percent and 80 percent, respectively. In these vehicles, the indirect tax has been raised by 20 percent each.According to EV traders, the market is flooded with various EV models, features, and looks, and customers have options to select according to their needs. They said that EVs ranging from Rs4 million to Rs5.5 million have a large customer base, while high-priced EVs are also seeing good sales.EV traders said that despite the market slowdown, the EV sector has not been affected.“One interesting emerging trend is that people who already own conventional combustion vehicles are also buying EVs,” said Golchha. \nOn May 28, presenting the financial plan for the upcoming fiscal year, Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun said all the 77 districts of the country are now connected by the national road network.But the ground reality is different.Without a bridge over the Karnali river at Chuwa Khola of Kharpunath rural municipality, Simkot, the district headquarters of Humla, remains to be connected to the national road network. Villagers in the northwestern corner of Nepal bordering Tibet in China where the Humla Karnali crosses face hardships in the absence of one bridge.Though the track was opened to Simkot in mid-April, the construction of the bridge has yet to be completed. As a result, a 12 km section still needs to be completed to connect the district headquarters.Now, vehicles carrying goods along the Karnali Corridor can only reach Kharpu. From there, the goods have to be transported by helicopters and carried over the river using cables, resulting in additional costs. This method, however, is possible only when the water level is low. Due to the lack of a bridge, around ten vehicles bought for government offices and passenger service via Surkhet were taken across the river using ropes and a bulldozer. The cars are now operating on the Simkot side.In 2007-08, the government announced in the annual budget that it would connect Simkot to the national road network. However, even after a decade and a half, Simkot is not connected to the national road network.In September 2021, the joint venture of Swachchhanda, Mount, and Pumori was awarded the Rs110 million contract for the bridge. The construction companies were issued Rs11 million in advance, and the project completion deadline was fixed in March this year.However, the company did not start the construction work for a long time, and around a year ago, it was necessary to change the design.“The joint venture company was responsible for constructing a 55-metre-long motorable truss bridge. But when the contractor started to dig the foundation, a hot water spring was found,” said Bel Bahadur Nepali, chief of the Simikot-Hilsa Road Construction Project. “The assessment showed that the bridge will not be durable if it is constructed on the existing design. So, we made the new design, which got approved two weeks ago. We will start the bridge construction work in July.”Nepali said that with the change in design, the contractor has been given a new deadline to complete the project: August 2025.Binod Kumar Pokharel, chief district officer, said the locals have demanded a Bailey or portable bridge as it may take time to complete the project. “Due to the lack of a bridge, the travellers are facing hassles. The passenger and goods transport charges too are high.”Pokharel said the river's flow is high throughout the year, so vehicles must be towed across the river with the help of an earthmover to Simkot. “To solve the problem, the locals have demanded a Bailey bridge. We are assessing the need.”Until last year, vehicles were operated from Khulalu of Kalikot towards Mugu-Bajura-Sillisalla of Humla. Nepali said that the 39 km road track was opened this year. This year, a 39-kilometre stretch was added. The project opened 8 km of the total track, and the Nepal Army did the work on the remaining 9 km section. The road from Khulalu of Kalikot to the Chinese border is 268 km long. Of this, 95 km south of Simkot is served by transportation. However, as the vehicle flow is breached by the lack of a bridge, passengers from Simkot to Khapunath rural municipality must change the vehicle by crossing suspension bridges on foot.Dan Bahadur Shahi, a senior citizen, said since there is no bridge, vehicles are charging higher fares. Jeeps run on the 12km Simkot-Kharpu stretch. The vehicle operators charge Rs700 to Rs1,000 per person as fare for a special arrangement called “reserve”. In similar fashion, the jeep operated from Kharpu via Sillisalli to Surkhet charges Rs7,000 per person, he said.“We are compelled to change the vehicle as there is no bridge. While crossing the river using the suspension bridge, we need to pay wages to a porter,” Shahi said. “If there were a bridge, we would be able to reach Surkhet by a single vehicle, and the fare would be less.”The price of daily consumable goods in Simkot is sky high, too. “No goods-carriers operate here; small jeeps are permitted to carry passengers only. This means we have to transport goods using porters so the prices refuse to come down,” said Bhim Bahadur Rokaya, a trader at Simkot.“There is no chance of prices falling unless a bridge is constructed across the Kharpu river, allowing for goods to be ferried by trucks,” Rokaya said.Pokharel said that because route permits are issued only from Khulalu of Kalikot to Sillisalli, fares are not fixed. “We have directed the Transport Management Office, Jumla, to manage the route permit and fare. The decision will be taken soon by a meeting of the transportation management committee.” \nKP Sharma Oli has pulled out yet another rabbit from his old bag of tricks. Barely four months after extending support to Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s leadership of the government, CPN-UML, the second largest party in Parliament, has decided to end its political association with Dahal and join hands with Nepali Congress, the largest party. Saturday’s apparently sudden meeting between Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba and CPN-UML chair KP Oli at the latter’s residence laid the ground for a potential new political alliance between the two parties.Multiple senior Congress and UML leaders told the Post that Deuba and Oli had already reached an understanding in a meeting on Sunday midnight at an undisclosed location in Kathmandu, where they tentatively agreed to form a new government, amend the constitution, and to work out a power-sharing formula, which they reportedly shared with a few confidants. As per the understanding between Congress and UML, Oli will lead a new ‘national consensus’ government for a year and a half. For the remaining term, Deuba will be the prime minister, a Nepali Congress leader who is preparing a draft agreement between the two parties told the Post on Monday night. A four-member task force has prepared the draft agreement, which will be released on Tuesday. It will detail the power-sharing arrangement, propose amendments to the constitution, review the electoral system including proportional representation, change national assembly arrangements, and discuss size of provincial assemblies, according to a taskforce member. Ramesh Lekhak and Gyanendra Bahadur Karki from the Congress and Shankar Pokhrel and Ramesh Badal from the UML had held several rounds of talks in the past two weeks, said a UML leader. If everything goes according to plan, a deal will be public by Tuesday, and chairman Oli will stake claim to the post of prime minister on Tuesday itself, a UML minister said. Two Congress leaders familiar with the meeting as per the understanding between Oli and Deuba, Oli will lead the new government with the support of Nepali Congress and other fringe parties. The Congress will lead 10 ministries including home, and the UML nine including finance, as per the draft understanding. Likewise, the Congress and the UML will lead three provincial governments each, with the government in Madhesh to be led by a regional party. There has also been a verbal agreement on formation of a high-powered constitution review and suggestions committee under a former chief justice of the Supreme Court. Deuba and Oli had reportedly been in talks over the past one month in order to address some pressing national issues, and have agreed to amend the constitution where needed. They are also said to have reached understandings on foreign policy, economic crisis, and governance.One big issue that is said to have caused a rift between Prime Minister Dahal and Oli was over the appointment of the chairman of the Securities Board of Nepal or Sebon. The appointment process was ultimately cancelled on Saturday due to differences between the two leaders.Sources inside the Finance Ministry said the selection process became the victim of the political power play between the UML and the Maoist Centre, leading to the cancellation of the entire process.But after a meeting between the two on Monday morning, a Cabinet meeting later in the day decided to give continuity to the old three-member committee to nominate candidates for Sebon chair.Some media reports tried to link the latest Deuba-Oli meeting with yet another development, as it took place a day after Nepal Police arrested Bechan Jha, one of the alleged middlemen in the high-profile Bhutanese refugee scam.Police last year filed cases against politicians, bureaucrats and middlemen on charges of defrauding hundreds of people by promising to send them to the US as Bhutanese refugees. But police were not able to book Jha despite his connection with the scam.Jha is allegedly close to many political leaders, including senior Congress leaders, and the Congress leadership might have been worried that they too could be dragged into the refugee scam.Differences between Oli and Dahal had been steadily building, including over the new Sebon chair, the appointment of ambassadors to eight countries, transitional justice, and the bringing of what Oli termed a ‘Maoist budget’ for the new fiscal year. During their meeting on Monday morning, Oli reportedly requested Dahal to support him by stepping down. “I had serious discussions with Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba on the formation of a new government in order to make some changes to the constitution and to address some pressing national issues,” a UML leader quoted Oli as telling him. According to the UML leader, Dahal offered Oli the post of prime minister within the current ruling coalition, but Oli politely turned down the offer. The UML chair instead expressed his desire to lead a consensus government, the UML leader told the Post.Deuba and Oli were in talks for a month through different channels. After several rounds of back-channel talks and negotiations between the second-ranking leaders of the Nepali Congress and UML, they finally agreed to meet.According to the two UML leaders who were briefed about the latest situation, time has come to form a government based on national consensus in order to address the country’s daunting challenges.Prime Minister Dahal had called a meeting of ruling partners for 5:00 pm on Monday, but the meeting had to be postponed in light of the new situation. Dahal, who was all set to reshuffle the Cabinet, was planning to discuss the same in the meeting.   \nIt has been 20 years since the 2005 Hong Kong Ministerial Meeting recognised that developing and, mainly, least developed countries (LDCs) cannot meaningfully participate in the global trading system as envisaged while establishing the World Trade Organization (WTO) without “some kind of support” to enhance their trade capacity. This gave birth to the idea of Aid for Trade (AfT). The WTO claims that AfT is particularly helpful to the LDCs, which “face a range of supply-side and trade-related infrastructure obstacles which constrain their ability to engage in international trade.” In theory, it mobilises resources to address the trade-related constraints identified by these countries.According to WTO data, $556 billion in AfT was disbursed between 2006 and 2020. AfP’s priority and focus naturally shift with the tide of time. Initially, it focused more on improving trade logistics and enabling small businesses to trade their generally uncompetitive products, wishfully, in developed countries. Now, the weight of the discourse seems to be inclined to climate change issues arising in every knot of the supply chain, the scope of gender equity in sharing trade benefits, and the digital divide as an additional constraint to LDCs when the global trade in both goods and services is being rapidly digitised.Key questionsHas the AfT really helped developing and least-developed countries build their trade capacities and provided the much-needed market share for their goods (and services) in developed countries? The WTO leadership claims that trade (solely?) lifted 1.5 billion people out of abject poverty. It appears as if the global population’s poverty reduction is only because of increased cross-border trade and all the official development assistance received by any poverty-stricken country meant only for trade. Nevertheless, the amount in aggregate disbursement under AfT looks impressive. When it comes to the annual average, it is less than $40 billion a year; when divided among the 137 developing out of 217 economies, the dole out is mere symbolism and not enough to undertake even a single medium-sized project. Forty-five countries are still categorised as LDCs, and 32 are small, landlocked economies like Nepal. When viewed through the challenges faced in accessing trade passage through another sovereign territory, the correlation between their LDC status and landlockedness can’t just be coincidental.For instance, according to the Creditor Reporting System of OECD, Nepal received over $300 million as AfT until 2019. The Enhanced Integrated Framework under the WTO supported the development of the Nepal Trade Integration Strategy (NTIS) to identify the goods with import potential and to conduct several studies like the e-readiness of the businesses. Nepal has developed three versions of the NTIS in the last 15 years—in 2010, 2016 and 2023. The country has increased the list of products and services from 19 to thirty-six. But export trade has only nose-dived over this period, not only in terms of export-import ratio but also in nominal value.Why have we failed in our trade capacity building so badly, and why couldn't all the financial aid flow in support to this end? More importantly, have these international frameworks and support helped developing and least-developed countries excel in balancing their trade in their favour? More often than not, the answer, sadly, is in the negative. Why are LDCs left behind?The 9th Aid for Trade review took place at the WTO headquarters in Geneva in the last week of June. Sessions like “Trade for All” and “Realizing LDCs’ Trade Potential” were also part of the rituals. The reasons for LDCs’ failures may be aplenty, including their inability to set production and trade priorities, bad governance and political instability. However, in the true sense, they are not supported throughout this process. Instead, these voiceless countries are incessantly derided for not doing enough, being reactive, making negativity a survival tactic, and being angry and critical of the Western developed countries for no reason. The reality is different. These essentially neo-colonial narratives are created to cover up the developed countries’ intentions to extend their trade protectionism. They lecture on the developing and poor countries on the perils of climate change while failing to change their own lifestyle and renunciating their luxuries, even partially. Such annual rituals, even publications, highlight achievements that hardly reflect ground reality in the countries concerned; instead, feigned diplomatic niceties rule the roost.Contentious issues like the possibility of the supply chain being destroyed by the Russia-Ukraine war, the trade wars between the major trade partners in the world, like the US and China and India and China, and their gross violations of global trade rules, are hardly discussed in detail. The discussion on peripheral issues chosen by “experienced” consultants makes it easy to evade truly excruciating issues. Underdeveloped and developing countries are instructed to transform into a green economy. But the governments and citizens of developed countries who are using air conditioners, refrigerators and fossil fuel vehicles on a mammoth scale are not ready to give up their lifestyles. The underdeveloped world, which consumes only a very small part of it, is held guilty. The developed countries have no intention of reducing major carbon emissions, and it looks impossible given their consumption patterns. Seventy percent of the electricity consumed by developed countries comes from coal, diesel and petrol plants. Air travel and cargo shipment are unlikely to be replaced by green energy for the next several decades.There is nothing for least-developed countries to sell in the competitive global trade. They cannot be expected to produce and sell high-quality, refined and high-value-low volume goods. They can sell either agricultural products or primary or secondary raw materials. It can never be a profitable and sustainable trade. Lately, organic products have suddenly become the import priority of developed countries. But have chemical fertilisers and pesticides been explored and diffused by developing countries? The production system of the developing world became dependent on harmful fertilisers and pesticides produced and aggressively traded by the developed countries. How, then, will these agriculture-based economies trade with new phyto-sanitation and other rules?Worst of all, the West has monopolised the knowledge products, knowledge systems and discourses related to the trade vulnerability of the LDCs. This has created a significant barrier even for a dispassionate debate on it. The LDCs are once again at the receiving end of the so-called global system—trade. \n\n\nSri Lanka's ancient irrigation system, diverse attractions, and recent resurgence in tourism make it a captivating holiday destination despite its economic challenges.\nEducation in Every Home’s report titled ‘Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in Nepal’s Textbooks’ highlights the lack of diversity, inclusivity, and inaccuracies in these textbooks.  The findings include egregious mistakes in textbooks like the inclusion of a letter Abraham Lincloln supposedly wrote—dating to a time 17 years after his assassination, to assertions like Brazil has tigers, elephants and rhinos while Germany has tigers and monkeys. The books display a clear bias in favour of Brahmin Chhetri males, while women make up just 18 percent of all people profiled. While 80 percent of all bylines are male, the presence of marginalised communities, especially Dalits, is nearly non-existent.  \nThe Mandala Alumni Drama Festival showcases six original plays created by alumni, ranging from thought-provoking discourses to satirical comedies, emphasizing youth, roots, and the art of performativity in theater.\nThe Communist Party of Nepal-Unified Marxist-Leninist (CPN-UML) demands PM Pushpa Kamal Dahal's resignation while Congress president KP Oli eyes premiership with Nepali Congress (NC) support, as Dahal's coalition government faces a confidence vote on July 12 due to the withdrawal of support from CPN-UML and Janata Samajbadi Party.\nNepal's Nepali Congress supports forming a new government led by KP Oli under Article 76 (2) of the constitution, following a deal with UML despite opposition from some party members and Prime Minister Dahal.\nThe Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML on Monday night inked a deal to form a new ruling alliance by ousting the current Pushpa Kamal Dahal government while also agreeing to amend the Constitution of Nepal promulgated just nine years ago.Though the country’s two largest parties are yet to make the details of the deal public, their leaders claim they have unanimously agreed to revise some constitutional provisions, mainly related to the electoral system. The ruling CPN (Maoist Centre) has come out strongly against the agreement to revisit the constitution, calling it a regressive move aimed at reviving the 1990 constitution.The Congress and the UML, however, have rubbished the allegations, claiming that their plan to amend the statute is for the country’s good. “The amendment is for stability, which will drive the country on the path of prosperity and development. Some comrades find contextual amendment regressive but I say it is a progressive step,” said Congress chief whip Ramesh Lekhak while addressing a programme on Saturday.The constitution is a living document which can undergo revision to suit the changed context without altering its core values. Different provisions in the statute could be amended but only through a broader consultative and legitimate process, say experts.“The constitution amendment needs proper homework and larger acceptability,” Bipin Adhikari, a professor at the Kathmandu University School of Law, told the Post. “Trying to amend it through an amendment bill registered by the two large parties will only give room for extremist forces to play. A well-thought-out process must be adopted; it cannot be done in a hurry.”He said, first, an expert panel must be constituted to properly study what changes are really required, based on an assessment of the implementation of the constitution in the past nine years. The Congress and the UML need to have an agreement on the content, and then look for national consensus on the issue. “The amendment should be done with a broader objective of strengthening the federal republic.”Some constitutional experts agree that the electoral system needs to be revised for stability. Talking to the Post last month, senior advocate Purna Man Shakya, who also teaches at Nepal Law Campus, said that for greater stability, the electoral system, at least in the provinces, needs to be changed. However, unlike the Congress and the UML, who want changes in both tiers of government, Shakya said, “The new system can be adopted at the federal level if it first succeeds in ensuring stability at the provincial level.”But not everyone agrees that adopting a full first-past-the-post system for the House of Representatives, as many in the Congress and the UML seem to contemplate, will ensure stability. They rather claim that it has been proven wrong on different occasions in the past. “We have evidence that the FPTP alone doesn’t ensure stability. The Congress won the majority in 1959, 1991 and 1999. Was the country stable then?” questions Tula Narayan Shah, a political analyst. He calls the claim of stability through constitutional amendments dishonest, which, he alleges, is being thought of with the intent of establishing the Khas-Arya domination in the House.The group had 70 percent representation in Parliament until the proportional representation system was adopted, after which it fell to 35 percent in the first and the second Constituent Assembly, at a time when only 40 percent of lawmakers were elected directly, according to Shah.“This is why the FPTP’s proportion was increased to 60 percent in the 2015 constitution, which increased the Khas-Arya share to 55 percent,” he said. “A fully FPTP system will allow this community to maintain a hegemony in Parliament.”Stating that class, power connections, caste and gender are the four dominant factors to win direct elections, the minority groups will be sidelined if the proportional representation system is eliminated, Shah added.The mixed electoral system was adopted after the people’s movement of 2006, after a realisation that only a proportional system can ensure the representation of the marginalised and minority communities. The Maoist Centre and the Madhesh-based forces had pushed for it.Senior Advocate Adhikari, who also is a constitutional expert, said the constitution should not be amended without the Maoist Centre and the Madhes-based parties on board.In the view of some experts, the constitution can be amended broadly on five issues. First, provincial boundaries can be redrawn. A separate Madhesh Province was created but the grievances of the Tharu community were neglected. This can be addressed. Second, revision in the electoral system is possible but without killing the spirit of inclusion and representation.Similarly, different constitutional commissions have failed to perform effectively in the absence of proper coordination and with duplication of jurisdiction. That can be adjusted through amendments in the statute. Also, implementation of the fundamental rights are subject to making law now. That needs to be corrected, making sure they are implemented with an immediate effect. Also, there should be delineation of electoral constituencies based on population while also taking the geographical area into consideration, according to the experts.“Rigorous homework and proper justification are needed for the amendment,” said Adhikari. “For broad legitimacy, the parties, after listing out the necessary amendments, can take them to the people at the next general elections.” \nIn the normal course of things, the parliamentary hearing of election commissioner nominee Krishna Man Pradhan would have been completed on Friday. The Parliamentary Hearing Committee would have approved his nomination for the constitutional body, paving the way for his appointment by the President.However, the House committee on Thursday decided to postpone his hearing indefinitely after listening to a complainant, who filed objections against Pradhan’s nomination, accusing him of sexual exploitation. The victim has accused Pradhan of sexually exploiting her for five continuous years until last year.The woman who had lodged a complaint against Pradhan had settled the case out of court after the latter paid Rs10 million in compensation. Appearing before the committee, the victim—in her 30s—said she had to compromise as Pradhan had assured her a well-paying job.“I reluctantly accepted his demand as I desperately needed a job,” the woman told the House committee, according to one of its members. The victim said she agreed to settle the case for money given her dire economic condition. She has also handed over an audio recording as proof of her exploitation by Pradhan.“I filed the complaint to stop such a morally corrupt person from taking the constitutional position. How can you approve his nomination?” she questioned the lawmakers on the committee.Talking to journalists after listening to the victim, Pashupati Shumsher Rana, who chaired the meeting, said they needed to study the matter seriously, as endorsing a candidate for a dignified constitutional position like an election commissioner is a serious responsibility. Committee members said they wanted more time for additional hearings as they want to make the right decision. Ishwari Neupane, a member of the committee, the evidence provided by the complainant is being studied. “We are aware that only a person with high moral integrity can hold the constitutional position. At the same time, we also need to ensure that we don’t do injustice to the nominee. We, therefore, are studying the matter closely,” she told the Post.A two-thirds majority of the 15-strong committee, which has lawmakers from both the chambers of Parliament, can reject the nomination. A member of the committee said a wrong decision of the Constitutional Council has left them in a dilemma. A meeting of the constitutional council recommended Pradhan for the vacant post of election commissioner.“It is the council's responsibility to nominate the right candidates for such important posts,” said the lawmaker. “We don't want to endorse a controversial nominee. But we are not sure if we can do that as Pradhan was picked by the heads of three state organs and the chief of the country’s largest party.”The council headed by Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who also is the CPN (Maoist Centre) chair, had unanimously nominated him. Speaker Devraj Ghimire, National Assembly chair Narayan Dahal, Chief Justice Bishowambhar Prasad Shrestha and deputy Speaker Indira Rana too approved the nomination without question. Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba too gave his stamp of approval. Legal experts say wrong recommendations by the constitutional council automatically raise questions about the intent and capability of its chair and members. “The council cannot make recommendations haphazardly. It must properly check the background of the candidate before nomination,” Raju Prasad Chapagain, former chair of the Constitutional Lawyers’ Forum, told the Post. Legal experts say the Constitutional Council Act clearly states that the nominees for the constitutional positions must be qualified, appropriate for the particular position and hold high moral ground. “It is the responsibility of the members of the council to carry out proper vetting of the nominees. As other members have political background, the chief justice has a major role in vetting. But [Chief Justice] Shrestha failed in this case,” said a constitutional lawyer. He said Pradhan’s bad deeds were no secret in the legal fraternity.“The council fully overlooked Pradhan’s tainted past. There must be some interest at play,” the lawyer further said.

The metropolis has upgraded its urban health clinics to urban health promotion centres and started providing services through medical doctors. “Due to the lack of doctors at our urban health promotion centres, patients suffering from mental health problems have been deprived of timely treatment,” said Nali Bajracharya, a senior public health officer at the department. “Now patients having mental health issues and seeking care at our health centres will also get mental health treatment.”Though neither the federal government agency nor the city office has data on the number of people suffering from mental health problems in the metropolis, doctors estimated that a lot of people could be suffering from various forms of mental health problems—anxiety, depression and others.Officials say that they are also planning to provide free medication to patients with mental health problems.Health workers say that many city dwellers, despite having mental health problems, do not seek treatment and instead turn to drugs and substances to cope. Due to the entrenched social stigma, fear of discrimination and other factors, many patients in Nepal do not talk about their mental health issues.The general tendency among people to conceal mental health issues due to the stigma attached to it has also forced patients to opt for substance abuse, doctors say.They say that while drugs and alcohol may provide temporary relief from stress, they are not a solution and can adversely affect mental health and well-being in the long run.“Treatment in the initial stage of mental illness helps patients achieve better results. For that, early diagnosis is crucial,” said Dr Pomawati Thapa, chief of the Non-communicable Disease and Mental Health Section at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Other local units should also follow the initiative to provide mental health screening training to health workers, including doctors.”Nepal is among the countries with highest rates of suicide, which is an extreme manifestation of a mental health problem.According to Nepal Police data, 6,993 people took their own lives in the fiscal year 2022-2023. This accounts for more than 19 deaths on average daily. Fifty-six percent of those who die by suicide are men.Doctors say that people do not attempt suicide for a single reason, but due to a complex situation arising from multiple problems.An increasing number of people are struggling with mental problems owing to the rising cost of living and the struggle to manage even their most basic needs, such as food, housing, healthcare and jobs, experts say.Whatever the cause, suicides and suicide attempts have a ripple effect, impacting families, friends, colleagues, communities and societies, doctors say.A study carried out by the Nepal Health Research Council in the past shows that about 13 percent of Nepalis suffer from some form of mental disorder. This means around one in eight Nepalis has mental health issues. Moreover, the country simply does not have enough experts to treat mental health problems, it added.Studies show the magnitude of suffering, the burden and costs for individuals, families and societies arising from mental health disorders are alarming in Nepal.“No doubt, mental health problems have been emerging as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in our country,” said Thapa. “All local governments must take initiative to address the problems. Only the federal government agencies cannot do much.”The World Health Organisation says that one in four people in the world has been affected by mental or neurological disorders at some point in their lives, and around 450 million people currently suffer from such conditions, placing mental disorders among the leading causes of ill health and disability worldwide. \nDuring the 2022 local level election, people of Kathmandu elected independent candidate Balendra Shah as their mayor for five years. Sunita Dangol of the CPN-UML secured the position of KMC deputy mayor in the same election. When they began their term, many suspected that the two—an independent mayor and his party-affiliated deputy—wouldn’t have cordial relations. But, in the last two years of their term, there has been no visible disagreement between them. They proved their sceptics wrong.Deputy Mayor Dangol kept mum when Mayor Shah accused her party chair, KP Sharma Oli, of policy corruption in the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate land scam.Moreover, Shah expressed his anger on June 3 over the government’s intervention in his plan to widen pavements in the New Road area. Deputy Prime Minister Raghubir Mahaseth of the UML leads the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, which maintains major roads.After the ministry intervened in the municipal plan to expand the sidewalk on New Road, Shah took to social media and wrote, “Honourable KP Oli jyu, don’t hoodwink people by engineering yet another scam to hide a scam of Rs10,000 crore [Rs100 billion].”He further added, “You have reassured those who had made advance payments to buy land of Giri Bandhu Tea Estate that they would get the land within two years.” “If one looks at the policy corruption in the tea estate, it appears not a single leaf would stir without Oli’s nod,” Shah wrote.A few days prior to the incident, Mayor Shah had engaged in a heated debate with Chinkaji Maharjan, a UML member and chairman of KMC’s ward 22, over the sidewalk expansion plan.Dangol remained quiet on the issue thus far. However, at the city council meeting on Monday, which also discussed KMC's policies and programmes for the fiscal year 2024-25, she criticised Mayor Shah for his remarks.“This should be the first time the deputy mayor opposed the public behavior and statement of the mayor,” a Kathmandu ward chairperson told the Post on the condition of anonymity.Dangol had her initial plan to contest the mayor position independently but the UML gave her the deputy mayor’s ticket.Speaking during the Monday discussion, Deputy Mayor Dangol said, addressing Mayor Shah, “Your and mine voices are being heard and watched by Nepalis worldwide. Therefore, those of us who want to come to politics should think about our expression,” Dangol remarked. “We should maintain the image and dignity of the institution we represent.”She also emphasised the need to accommodate the voices of everyone in an undertaking.Though the representatives of Kathmandu Metropolitan City claim that Dangol's Monday statement was unusual, they deny any rift between the two leaders of the local government. “City council’s is an internal meeting of the KMC where various issues arise. We settle those issues internally,” Nabin Manandhar, the KMC spokesperson and ward 17 chairman from the Nepali Congress, told the Post. “Having an opinion does not necessarily mean criticism.”Rajesh Kumar Shrestha, chair of KMC ward 19, seconded Manandhar.However, local representatives of Kathmandu have been questioning Shah for his ‘lone-wolf’ manner of leading the institution.“We should develop a working relationship that welcomes everyone’s spirit,” Dangol told the council meeting. “If one thinks they are in a position and everything should be done as they say, it will only lead to trouble.”She added, “While working in a team, we definitely have a different opinion, but different opinions should be respected.”At the meeting, referring to Mayor Shah's past statements, council member Anita Karki asked him, saying, “What if the voters of Kathmandu set ablaze the Durbar where the KMC office lies?”In September last year, when the traffic police obstructed a KMC vehicle, later known to be used by his postpartum wife, Mayor Shah provocatively wrote on Facebook, threatening to burn Singha Durbar, the federal government’s central secretariat.Traffic police, under the federal government, had stopped the vehicle to check necessary documents on a Saturday.After the incident, Shah wrote on social media warning that if the government blocked KMC's vehicles again, he would set fire to Singha Durbar.Dangol said on Monday that she believed it was wrong to write on social media or make a statement inciting people to burn the Singha Durbar or the Bagh Durbar, where the KMC office is situated.Dangol, speaking at the city council meeting, also said there should be no polarisation between the representatives who were elected to develop Kathmandu. \nA police officer was found dead on the premises of the federal parliament building in Baneshwar, Kathmandu on Wednesday.According to Ekram Giri, spokesperson for the federal parliament secretariat, Ajit Gole of Dolakha committed suicide by shooting himself.The body of the victim was recovered from the parliament building’s washroom.Dinesh Mainali, spokesperson for the Kathmandu Metro Police Range, said Gole, who was on duty from 6am to 10am, was found dead at around 8 in the morning. “A constable of Nepal Police was found dead inside a toilet of the parliament building,” Mainali told the Post. “Preliminary investigation shows he was inflicted with a gunshot.”Nepal police said the investigation is underway. \nPolice on Friday arrested two people from Thimi of Bhaktapur for allegedly mining cryptocurrency.The Central Investigation Bureau took 50-year-old Biswas Gurung and Rajendra Tahamata, 25, into custody in connection with the crime, said Hobindra Bogati, spokesperson for the bureau.The duo allegedly ran mining operations from the CTEVT’s information technology lab using a server and 64 desktops, on which blockchain applications were found during a preliminary investigation. Further investigation into the matter is underway. \nThe vegetable supply chain to Kathmandu Valley has been disrupted by the inundation of large areas of standing crops in the current wave of floods and landslides across the country, pushing prices to new highs in the last two days.The torrential rains, which started on Friday, have killed 14 people and affected thousands of households, according to the authorities. Most of the highways have been affected by landslides. A vast swathe of agricultural land has been inundated.According to the Kalimati Fruits and Vegetable Market Development Board, tomatoes, potatoes, cabbage, cauliflower, eggplant, cow pea (long), French bean, soybean green, bitter gourd, bottle gourd, pointed gourd, snake gourd, smooth gourd, squash, okra, and leafy vegetables are currently among the most expensive kitchen ingredients in the Valley.Traders say the prices, which were already expensive, increased overnight.Retail prices of most vegetables have crossed Rs100 per kg within two days, said Shanta Adhikari, owner of Shanta Tarkari Pasal in Balkot. “I was buying tomatoes for Rs1,000 per crate (23 kg) till Friday. Today [Sunday], the price nearly doubled to Rs1,900 per crate.”Adhikari said the tomato retail price was hovering around Rs70–75 per kg until Friday and has now reached Rs100 per kg. As the Bhaktapur area has been flooded and inundated, the price of leafy vegetables has reached Rs100 per kg, from Rs70 per kg three days ago.The wholesale price of tomato big (Nepali) at the Kalimati market, the country’s largest fruits and vegetable wholesale venue, has increased by 26.67 percent to Rs95 per kg. Similarly, the price of tomatoes (local) has increased by 211.26 percent to Rs55 per kg, while the price of tomato small (tunnel) has risen by 186.72 percent to Rs65 per kg.Traders at Kalimati said that the wholesale price of all seasonal vegetables has risen as the rainfall has inundated crop fields and affected road transport.Adhikari said French beans, which she sold at Rs60-80 per kg on Friday, now cost Rs100 per kg. Similarly, smooth gourd, which she sold at Rs70-75 per kg, now costs Rs100, and cauliflower has reached Rs120 per kg. Capsicum, too, has become expensive. It costs Rs140 per kg.“Even the eggplant, which cost Rs50 per kg, has hit Rs80-85 per kg,” she said.The wholesale price of all three varieties of potatoes—red, Indian, and Mude—at the Kalimati market has increased within a week. The price of potato red has increased by 2.18 percent to Rs62.33 per kg, potato red (India) by 10.32 percent to Rs57 per kg, and potato red (Mude) by 3.92 percent to Rs53 per kg.The wholesale price of cabbage has sharply increased by 62.63 percent to Rs45 per kg, eggplant long by 57.14 percent to Rs55 per kg, and eggplant round by 36.36 percent to Rs75 per kg.The long cowpea price has increased by 44.44 percent to Rs65 per kg, the French bean by 76.92 percent to Rs115 per kg, and the French bean (rajma) by 27.27 percent to Rs140 per kg in wholesale.Seasonal soybean green wholesale price has increased by 26.32 percent to Rs120 per kg.The wholesale price of bitter gourd has sharply increased by 111.11 percent to Rs95 per kg, while the price of bottle gourd has risen by 66.67 percent to Rs75 per kg.The wholesale price of pointed gourds has increased by 28.57 percent to Rs45 per kg, snake gourds by 22.22 percent to Rs55 per kg, and smooth gourds by 36.36 percent to Rs75 per kg.The wholesale price of squash has increased by 36.36 percent to Rs75 per kg, and the price of okra has also gone up by 36.36 percent to Rs75 per kg.Seasonal cucumber (local) wholesale price has increased by 68.42 percent to Rs160 per kg.“The constant rainfall has hit vegetables ready to be shipped to the market. So it is predictable that the prices will go higher in the coming days,” said Binay Shrestha, information officer at the Kalimati Fruits and Vegetable Market Board.Shrestha said the supply of fresh vegetables in Kathmandu has also slowed down. “Our market received 600–650 tonnes of vegetables daily during this time, but we are receiving hardly 500 tonnes now.”Adhikari said she has been selling stale vegetables because she has not received sufficient fresh supplies.Currently, the Kalimati market receives seasonal vegetables from the districts neighbouring Kathmandu Valley such as Makawanpur, Dhading, and Kavre, besides a few districts from the Tarai like Chitwan and Sarlahi.“Despite being kitchen essentials, when prices cross Rs100 per kg, people tend to buy vegetables less,” Adhikari said. “As a result, business in the shops and market also slows down.” \nRakura has launched its next generation of tea products. The company has introduced its revolutionary Magic Knot Teabags, using the world’s first state-of-the-art Tandem Air-knotted technology.Featuring the latest non-heat sealed, double-chambered teabag design, the teabag boasts of being amongst the world’s first and Nepal’s only fully plastic and glue-free teabag. The magic knot teabag also includes new innovations such as the world’s first certified organic, unbleached thread—assuring non-GMO cotton and no harmful chemicals, together with the updated easy-hold tags that are more comfortable to hold and are made of food-grade board and ink, the company said in a statement. The company has also created 21 new varieties of teas while also improving its existing teas and blends, achieving a tea collection that is amongst the biggest in the world. “Given our history of always breaking new ground for the Nepalese tea industry, we’ve again initiated a new era for Nepal’s tea,” said Neeraj Rathi, managing director of Rakura. “We’re calling our next-generation products the most healthful and eco-friendly in the world because there is no other tea product in the world that has all of our innovations in a single pack.” \nFour hundred twenty-one climbing permits were issued for fee-paying individuals during the 2024 Everest season, which ended on May 29. Around 600 people, including 200 foreigners, completed the perilous ascent. Nearly 2,000 people assembled at the base camp. Eight died. These people brought 100 tonnes of waste. Looking ahead to 2025, the world’s tallest peak could have new rules, tighter restrictions and higher fees.Tourism Minister Hit Bahadur Tamang told the National Assembly on Thursday that the ministry has tabled a draft of a new Mountaineering Regulations at the Cabinet, to address the current challenges and evolving context. The Post could not independently verify whether the new regulations will take effect from the beginning of the new fiscal year (July 16). Although the current Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led coalition government has fallen into minority following the withdrawal of support by its largest partner, officials say a change in government is unlikely to affect the mountaineering policy.Rakesh Gurung, director of the mountaineering section of the Tourism Department, said that starting in the spring of 2025, a climbing permit for Everest will cost $15,000. Currently, the permit to climb the 8,848.86-metre Himalayan giant costs $11,000 for foreigners and Rs75,000 for Nepalis. The last time the government reviewed the royalty fee was on January 1, 2015. At that time, an expedition with a maximum of 15 members cost $10,000 per person.The cost has now been revised for autumn and winter, as well as the climbing routes. As per the draft, in 2025, Nepal will introduce death repatriation insurance for climbers for the first time.“We have set a minimum coverage of Rs5 million ($37,593) for repatriating bodies under the insurance plan, which will be mandatory,” said Gurung. “The insurance should be done in Nepal.”He said expedition agencies would be responsible for retrieving bodies from the base camp and upper reaches.The draft regulations propose increasing the insurance coverage paid by climbers for their high-altitude guides to Rs2 million ($15,037) from the existing Rs1.5 million ($11,278). Additionally, the regulations mandate that every climber, no matter how experienced, must be accompanied by a Nepali guide.“We have proposed a ban on alpine-style or solo climbing,” said Gurung.Before preparing the new regulations, the Law Ministry debated the issue, as it was concerned that banning solo climbing could restrict the personal freedom of alpinists. “But we presented our arguments on why banning solo climbing is crucial for saving lives,” said Gurung. “The law ministry was finally convinced.” Among eight deaths on Everest this year, five were preventable, said Gurung.The Mongolian duo—Tsedendamba Usukhjargal and Lkhagvajav Purevsuren—who were both experienced mountaineers and members of the Hunnu hiking club—climbed Everest without supplemental oxygen and Sherpa guides. They went missing on May 13 and were found dead on May 17.On May 22, Binod Babu Bastakoti, a Nepali national, died near the South Col while descending from the summit. It was later found that he decided to hire a guide only at Camp II when he started facing difficulties.As in previous years, this year too, a group of foreign climbers were reportedly found climbing the higher reaches without obtaining a permit from the government.The new regulations propose introducing “Monitoring Rangers” on Everest from next season, comprising officials from the Nepal Army, Nepal Police, Armed Police Force, and various ministries and government bodies.“This unit will be authorised to monitor every activity on Everest and go up to the higher reaches for investigation,” said Gurung.According to the Himalayan Database, which records all expeditions and deaths in the Himalayas, there have been more than 200 deaths on the Nepal side of Everest between 1953, when Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay Sherpa first scaled the peak, and 2022.Nepal’s tourism ministry started documenting Everest incidents in 1922 when seven Sherpa climbers died in an avalanche, marking the first reported deaths on the tallest mountain. But it has no archive of those who lost their lives on the icy slopes.Separately, the tourism department has proposed a garbage management fund—to be raised from each climber, which will be used to clean up Everest.“We have proposed that the fund provision be included in the Tourism Act, which is currently in the drafting phase,” said Gurung, adding that this provision, however, is not part of the new regulations.With more and more people visiting each year, Everest has grown increasingly polluted. This has led to the contamination of the local watershed, threatening the health of local people.The slopes are littered with discarded empty oxygen canisters, abandoned tents, food containers, and even human faeces. The base camp has tented toilets with large collection barrels that can be carried away and emptied. Hundreds of gas and electric heaters and stoves are used at the base camp to cook food and keep warm, thus contributing to the warming of the area.Climate change is melting snow and ice, exposing even more garbage and bodies that have been covered for decades. All that waste pollutes the natural environment and poses a serious health risk to everyone who lives in the Everest watershed.Nearly 100 tonnes of garbage were collected during this spring climbing season from Everest and Lhotse, which share the same base camp.According to the Sagarmatha Pollution Control Committee (SPCC), 77.19 tonnes of waste was collected from the Everest base camp alone during the Spring 2024 climbing season. With 8-9 tonnes coming from the higher camps brought by the expedition agencies, the SPCC collected 85 tonnes of waste this spring.The breakdown of collected waste shows burnable garbage at 27.99 tonnes, recyclable garbage at 7.51 tonnes, human waste at 27.53 tonnes, and kitchen waste at 14.15 tonnes. Besides, the Nepal Army collected over 11 tonnes of garbage.In the Spring of 2023, the SPCC managed nearly 70 tonnes of waste generated by expedition groups. Since 2015, the SPCC has also enforced the 8 kg garbage rule, under which every climber ascending the Everest base camp must bring back at least 8 kg of garbage. Anyone visiting Everest must pay a $4,000 garbage deposit, which is refunded if the person returns with 8 kg.Before the start of the climbing season this year, the Supreme Court issued a mandamus order directing the government to regulate the rising number of expeditions on the world’s tallest mountain.A division bench of justices Sapana Pradhan Malla and Sushma Lata Mathema ordered the government to issue climbing permits only after specifying the number of climbers that can be safely accommodated.The court order followed increasing traffic jams on the world’s highest peak and the trash people leave on its slopes. Everest has even been called the ‘world's highest garbage dump’.This spring, the government implemented a slew of new rules in the Himalayas, including mandatory use of tracking devices and poo bags while summiting the peak.Jagat Prasad Bhusal, chief administrative officer of the Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Rural Municipality, told the Post in a recent interview that the rural municipality sold 1,700 poo bags. “In the first year of its implementation, we have received good feedback and the requirement to bring the bags back.”“We are now discussing Everest's ‘carrying capacity’ as per the Supreme Court order. It’s difficult to ascertain what exactly the limit of Everest is,” said Gurung.In 365 days, Everest opens its climbing window for less than two weeks, depending on the weather.“Hopefully, we will soon have an answer to this query,” said Gurung. \nMalaysia Airlines hosted the largest airline trade event ever held in Malaysia, the first Malaysia Airlines Trade Elevation Summit 2024, in collaboration with Tourism Malaysia and the Malaysia Convention and Exhibition Bureau.This inaugural event brought together 300 delegates, including over 200 international attendees from 48 cities and 21 countries. The summit marked a significant milestone for Malaysia Airlines as it prepares for the VisitMalaysia Year 2026, which aims to position Kuala Lumpur as a gateway for Asia and beyond and establish Malaysia as a true ASEAN tourism and aviation hub. Group Managing Director of Malaysia Aviation Group, the parent company of Malaysia Airlines, Captain Izham Ismail commented, “This summit transcended the typical conference; it celebrated partnerships that embody Malaysia Airlines’ inclusive spirit as we collaborate globally for mutual growth. We eagerly anticipate showcasing Malaysia’s hospitality and advancing tourism objectives through strategic alliances.” \nWith monsoon havoc sweeping across the country, the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division has urged health workers to avoid taking leave during the season.Officials have warned that health facilities could be overwhelmed by patients in the coming days as outbreaks of waterborne and vector-borne diseases are expected, as floodwaters have contaminated most of the drinking water sources.“We have requested the provincial and local health authorities not to grant leave to health workers during the monsoon season,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director of the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Health agencies have been cautioned about the looming risk of outbreaks of waterborne and vector-borne diseases in the coming days.”Torrential rainfall started Friday wreaking havoc in various places across the country. At least 14 people have died in disaster-related incidents—nine in landslides and five in floods—since Friday, according to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority. Officials said 18 others have been injured, and four people are missing. Since the monsoon entered the country on June 10, at least 43 people have died in landslides and flood-related incidents. Lightning strikes killed as many as 19 people during this period.The monsoon season in Nepal is a time of epidemics during which thousands of people across the country become infected with water-borne and vector-borne diseases.The persistent rainfall that started on Friday not only destroyed houses and inundated settlements but also contaminated drinking water sources.Health officials warned that health facilities could witness an uptick in the number of viral fever cases, and waterborne diseases—diarrhoea, dysentery, food poisoning, and snake bites—in the coming days.“We have also requested central hospitals and medical colleges to be prepared for help during disease outbreaks,” said Ghimire. “As we don’t have enough doctors and health workers to deploy to control the outbreaks, we have to seek help from big hospitals and medical colleges.”Officials at the Ministry of Health and Population said that they have been raising awareness through all available means to inform people of the risks. “Essential medicines have been stockpiled, health workers have been asked to be ready for deployment to affected areas, anti-snake venom has been supplied to health facilities,” said Dr Prakash Budhathoki, spokesperson at the Health Ministry. “As of Sunday evening, no outbreaks have been reported.”According to health experts, sources of drinking water generally become contaminated in disaster-hit areas, and people displaced by natural disasters become highly vulnerable to infections with waterborne and vector-borne diseases. Every year, thousands of people get infected with vector-borne diseases such as dengue, kala-azar, malaria, and scrub typhus during this period. Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts. According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,432 people from 73 districts have been infected with the dengue virus since January this year. Among the 73 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases: 159. Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. Likewise, snakebite incidents and resulting deaths are also common during the season, but the phenomenon, which experts dub “a lurking invisible crisis”, remains grossly neglected. “Incidents of snakebites have started to surge over the last few weeks,” said Dr Rajiv Jha, director at Provincial Health Directorate of Madhesh Province. “Along with the surge in waterborne and vector-borne diseases in the coming days, we have anticipated a rise in snakebite cases.”Doctors say the only ways to prevent deaths from waterborne diseases, including diarrhoea, are to raise awareness and ensure safe drinking water.They say a combination of careful surveys, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation and treatment are required to contain the spread of the diarrhoeal infection. \nWith the onset of the rainy season, the incidents of snakebite are on the rise in western Tarai districts.Snakebite treatment centres and hospitals in Kanchanpur and Kailali districts of Sudurpaschim province are now crowded with snakebite patients. Treatment of the snakebite patients, according to health workers, is quite challenging as patients are often brought to the health facilities at the last minute.As many as 60 snakebite patients visited the Snakebite Treatment Centre set up by Nepal Army at Arjuni of Shuklaphanta National Park within the past three weeks. “Over the past one week three to four snakebite patients have been visiting the centre on a daily basis,” said Ratan Bohora, a paramedic at the Arjuni-based Snakebite Treatment Centre. The local residents have hugely benefited after the Nepali Army and the local community jointly established the snakebite treatment centre at Arjuni in 2014. The centre, however, has to refer the patients with serious health conditions to other well facilitated hospitals due to the lack of an intensive care unit (ICU) and ventilator. “Two patients who were bitten by poisonous snakes were referred to Mahakali Provincial Hospital in Mahendranagar this year. We have no alternative but to send serious cases of snakebite to other hospitals due to the lack of the ICU and ventilator facilities,” said Bohora. The centre also does not even have a monitor to track a patient's vital signs such as blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen levels. The flow of the patients is increasing, but the centre only has two paramedics to provide treatment.Incidents of snakebite and resulting deaths are common in Nepal, but the issue still remains grossly neglected as what experts call a lurking ‘invisible crisis’. Each year, around 2,700 people, mostly children and women from Nepal’s Tarai region, die of snakebites, according to a March 2022 report.Most snakebite incidents occur when farmers are transplanting paddy fields or children are playing outdoors. Health workers say that the snakes that live in water are generally less poisonous. “The cases that are most serious occurred at night, often inside houses. Such patients should be taken to hospital immediately,” said Bohora. According to him, people living in thatched-roof houses are especially vulnerable to snakebite, because snakes often enter such homes in search of rats.Nepal is home to around 17 highly venomous snakes. Each year, the country sees about 20,000 to 40,000 cases of snakebite. The numbers could be higher, as many cases of snakebite go unreported, health workers say.Another health challenge in rural Nepal is the superstitious belief in visiting shamans instead of seeking treatment at medical facilities for snakebite. Experts say awareness drives should be launched to educate people that the snakebite patients should be taken to the hospital at the earliest. They recommend promoting cleanliness around homes, preventing children from playing in bushy areas, avoiding nightime walks, and using torchlight while walking in the dark.“Treatment of snakebite patients is possible if they are taken to health facilities on time. Patients are often brought to the hospital only after their condition has worsened, resulting in serious consequences,” said Dr Arjun Bhatta, medical superintendent at Mahakali Provincial Hospital. According to him, 10 snakebite patients with serious health conditions visited the hospital in the past three weeks. “They returned home after treatment,” said Bhatta. \nThe Thapathali-based Paropakar Maternity and Women’s Hospital is going to organise a healthy baby competition next month with an aim to raise awareness about overall baby development. Officials at the hospital said that the competition will not only assess physical growth and health of babies, several expert teams will also evaluate feeding practices, exclusive breastfeeding, immunisation, and the use of family planning methods by parents to ensure proper birth interval.“We would like to request parents of babies born at our hospital in the past year to register their babies for the contest,” said Dr Shree Prasad Adhikari, director at the hospital. “This is also an opportunity for parents to show how their parenting has been yielding positive results.”The hospital administration, however, said that the contest would be open only to babies born at the maternity hospital.Around 24,000 babies are born at the hospital each year, with around 39 percent delivered through the Caesarean section.The hospital administration said the contest will be held on August 13, coinciding with the hospital’s anniversary, and registration will start on July 16. Babies will be assessed in three categories—1 to 45 days, 45 days to six months, and six months to one year.Doctors say that babies' body mass index will be monitored to assess their growth.“We will also evaluate exclusive breastfeeding practices, administration of routine vaccines, and use of family planning methods,” said Adhikari. “We will form several teams of experts to assess the babies and award certificates to the top three babies in each category.”Doctors at the hospital said that the contest would help raise awareness of good parenting, exclusive breastfeeding, healthy feeding habits, the drawbacks of giving junk food to small children, and the importance of using family planning methods to maintain appropriate intervals between births.Studies show that the exclusive breastfeeding rate in Nepal has been steadily declining over the years. According to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022, exclusive breastfeeding has been continuously declining from 70 percent in 2011 to 56 percent in 2021.What concerns health officials is that more educated and well-off mothers are less likely to exclusively breastfeed their babies, as shown by studies.The report said the proportion of children who are bottle-fed rises with increasing education among mothers, ranging from 12 percent among mothers with no formal education to 49 percent among those with more than a secondary education. The use of a bottle with a nipple is the highest in the highest wealth quintile, at 46 percent, and lowest in the poorest quintile, at 11 percent.The proportion of children aged 0–5 months who are exclusively breastfed fluctuates across wealth quintiles. The proportion is highest in the lowest wealth quintile—64 percent—and lowest in the highest quintile—44 percent.The proportion of children who are bottle-fed is higher in urban areas, at 26 percent, than in rural areas, at 15 percent. The use of a bottle with a nipple is lowest in Karnali Province, at 11 percent, and in Madhesh Province, at 12 percent, and the highest in Bagmati Province, at 43 percent.The report also showed that bottle-feeding practices often start in health facilities. It showed that 22 percent of children born in a health facility receive mixed milk feeding (breast milk and fresh, packaged, or powdered animal milk or infant formula), as compared to 12 percent of those born at home. The World Health Organisation, however, does not recommend bottle feeding, stating that the nipple on a feeding bottle is susceptible to contamination and increases the risk of diseases among children.Nepal had committed to increasing the exclusive breastfeeding rate to more than 90 percent by 2030, but the rate declined from 70 percent in 2011 to 66 percent in 2016 and to 56 percent in 2022.The same report also shows that four percent of children received no vaccination between 2016 and 2021. Experts say feeding practices, exclusive breastfeeding, awareness about the importance of routine vaccination, and the use of family planning methods are basic things that determine not only the health of babies but also their future.  \nThe COVAX facility, the United Nations-backed international vaccine-sharing scheme, has been supplying vaccine doses to Nepal for the last three days.Officials said that the vaccine is part of the 1.6 million doses the facility has committed to supply to the country in 2024.“We received 46,000 doses on the first day,” said Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the immunisation section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “Vaccine doses arrived yesterday and today too.”The COVAX-supplied vaccine doses are Pfizer-BioNTech monovalent vaccines, including the children’s vaccine. The monovalent or single component is designed for the Omicron variant XBB.1.5 of SARS-CoV-2.Officials said that the vaccine doses will be administered to the vulnerable groups, including pregnant women, those having compromised immunity, people suffering from chronic diseases and children having compromised immunity.Officials say around 100,000 vaccine doses will be administered to children between five and 11 having compromised immunity, including those suffering from cancer, HIV and other chronic diseases.They said that administration of vaccine doses is likely to start in the last week of July.Last month, Nepal confirmed the spread of the Covid sub-lineages KP.1, KP.2, KP.3, and KP.4 in the country. All the sub-variants are offshoots of the Omicron variant, which is considered responsible for the surge in new Covid cases in the last few months.Hospitals in Kathmandu had reported a surge in serious cases of Covid infection in April. Doctors attending to the infected patients had said that elderly people and those with underlying conditions were getting severe.The COVAX facility supplied millions of doses of various brands of the coronavirus vaccine which were used to inoculate the majority of the country's population.Earlier, the facility used to supply Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent vaccine doses that included a component of the original virus strain as well as a part of the Omicron variant to provide broad protection against Covid.The vaccine is called a bivalent Covid shot as it contains two components—the original virus strain, and Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 sub-variants.Over 12,000 people died and hundreds of thousands were infected in the first, second and third waves of the Covid pandemic in Nepal. \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar. \nThe noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built. Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nUruguay edged Brazil 4-2 in a penalty shootout on Saturday after going down to 10 men in a bruising 0-0 draw at the Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas to march into the semi-finals of the Copa America where they will face Colombia.With Vinicius Jr suspended for Brazil and watching on from the stands, Dorival Jr’s side struggled to create opportunities despite having a man advantage late in the second half when Uruguay's Nahitan Nandez was sent off.In the ensuing shootout, Sergio Rochet saved Brazil’s first penalty from Eder Militao while his teammate Douglas Luiz hit the post to give Uruguay the upper hand.Although keeper Alisson Becker denied Jose Maria Gimenez and Gabriel Martinelli scored to keep Brazil alive, Manuel Ugarte buried the decisive spot kick as Uruguay continued their quest for a record 16th Copa crown.In a bruising encounter with 41 fouls from both teams, players from both sides were involved in physical battles across the pitch.Brazil’s 17-year-old forward Endrick was on the receiving end of brutal challenges as a high-pressing Uruguay refused to give him space to breathe.On one occasion, Raphinha acted out when Endrick was pushed to the ground by Ronald Araujo as the Brazil skipper retaliated in anger by shoving back before the referee stepped in and had a stern word with both players, keeping his cards in his pocket.But Araujo’s night ended early when he was taken off with an injury after the half-hour mark and the match suddenly burst into life moments later when Darwin Nunez missed a close-range header that sailed over the net.Within seconds, Raphinha saw his shot on a counter-attack thwarted by keeper Rochet, Brazil’s best chance of the half.With Uruguay unable to find a way through, coach Marcelo Bielsa made three substitutions by the 67th minute but his plans were thrown into disarray when Nandez saw red for a painful tackle on Rodrygo.Nandez attempted to take the ball off the Brazilian with a studs-up challenge but only ended up catching his ankle, but the Real Madrid winger escaped any serious injury and was able to continue.He was initially given a yellow card but it was upgraded to a red card by the referee following a VAR review.Uruguay will face Colombia in Wednesday’s semi-final in Charlotte, North Carolina, after they thrashed Panama 5-0 earlier on Saturday. \nJames Rodriguez scored one goal and set up two more as Colombia thoroughly dismantled Panama in a 5-0 win at the State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, on Saturday to march into the Copa America semi-finals.“Los Cafeteros” are through to the semi-finals for the third time in four editions and they will face Uruguay, who beat Brazil 4-2 on penalties in Saturday’s other quarter-final.“The most important thing is still to come. We hope to reach the final,I am very happy because we are going through a good moment. Today we played a good game and scored the goals quickly.” said Rodriguez, who was named player of the match.Striker Jhon Cordoba outmuscled his marker to head home from a corner and give Colombia the lead in the eighth minute, before Nestor Lorenzo’s side were awarded a penalty after Panama goalkeeper Orlando Mosquera brought down Jhon Arias.James Rodriguez stepped up to the spot and smashed his effort into the roof of the net in the 15th minute to net his 28th international goal.Panama had a brief spell of possession midway through the first half, with their best chance coming in the 19th minute when Roderick Miller’s header bounced off the post and directly at goalkeeper Camilo Vargas, who displayed great reflexes to swat it away from goal.Colombia weathered the storm and punished their opponents from another set piece in the 41st minute, as Rodriguez played in Luis Diaz with a quick free kick and the Liverpool winger lobbed his shot over Mosquera from the edge of the area.Colombia eased off the throttle in the second half as they looked to control the game and see out the victory, but they were still the better side by far.They scored their fourth goal in the 70th minute after Richard Rios took advantage of some confusion in the Panama ranks in the aftermath of a foul to rifle in a low drive from range, which caught Mosquera unawares.Panama’s frustration appeared to show when defender Jose Cordoba clattered into Santiago Arias just inside the box to gift Colombia a clear penalty in stoppage time, which substitute Miguel Borja scored with the last kick of the match.The win extends Colombia’s unbeaten run to 27 matches, with their last defeat coming in a 1-0 loss to Argentina in February 2022.Colombia will play their semi-final match against Uruguay in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Wednesday.It was their best-ever performance at the Copa America, improving on their group stage exit on their debut in 2016. \nAn own goal by Mert Muldur completed a dramatic comeback for the Netherlands on Saturday as they overcame a tenacious Turkey 2-1 to book a Euro 2024 semi-final meeting with England.Netherlands desperately needed the attacking quality to get them out of trouble and into the last four. The defender bundled the ball into his own net in the 76th minute under pressure from Cody Gakpo as the Dutch bounced back from a poor first-half display to win a bruising clash.Stefan de Vrij had equalised only six minutes earlier after Turkey went into the break 1-0 up from Samet Akaydin’s 35th-minute header.Turkey rode waves of passionate support at the Olympiastadion to put themselves on course for an unlikely semi-final place but, after keeping the Dutch at bay, they finally succumbed to the pressure in the last 20 minutes.France and Spain meet in the other semi-final on Tuesday before the Dutch face England in Dortmund on Wednesday.The only one of the weekend’s quarter-finals to be completed without extra time or penalties was no less drama-filled.The goal came after sustained pressure from Turkey, who had seen off early Dutch dominance, to set up several opportunities, including a succession of corners.Initial enterprise from the Dutch was met with tenacious defence as Turkey giving their opponents little room to play in.It did not help the Dutch cause that attackers Memphis Depay and Gakpo looked flat, prompting coach Ronald Koeman into throwing on pinch hitter Wout Weghorst at the start of the second half.Although the imposing centre forward looked to sew panic among the Turkish defenders, however, it was at the other end that the next opportunities arose.Guler’s 56th-minute free kick was bent expertly around the Dutch wall but struck the outside of the post.Ten minutes later, Dutch keeper Bart Verbruggen got a hand to deny Baris Alper Yilmaz’s stinging shot and Kaan Ayhan missed out on tucking away the rebound as Weghorst cleared.The Dutch kept plugging away and, as Turkey’s defence became more scrambled, they finally made the breakthrough with Depay’s cross finding an unmarked De Vrij to head home in the 70th minute.The siege continued and it was matter of time before the Dutch grabbed a second, bundled in six minutes later as Gakpo pressurised Muldur after a cross by Dumfries.The resultant set piece was initially cleared but fell for teenager Arda Guler to deliver a perfect cross to the back post and Akaydin was first in a queue of three Turkish players to rise and head home.France and Spain meet in the other semi-final on Tuesday before the Dutch face England in Dortmund on Wednesday. \nAfter so many painful 12-yard setbacks, England embraced the shootout on Saturday as they beat Switzerland 5-3 on penalties after a 1-1 draw to reach the semi-finals of Euro2024 and move to within a step of their first overseas final.Trent Alexander-Arnold slammed home the decisive last of a faultless five to send England into their third semi-final in four tournaments after Jordan Pickford had saved from Manuel Akanji.It was the third successive Euro 2024 quarter-final to go to extra time, two of them to penalties, and in the semi-final in Dortmund on Wednesday England will face the Netherlands.In a game of few chances, Breel Embolo had put Switzerland ahead after 75 minutes when he poked home from close range, and Bukayo Saka levelled for England five minutes later with a brilliant strike off the far post.Saka, who missed in England’s Euro 2020 final shootout defeat by Italy, stood up again on Saturday and converted confidently in front of a wall of England fans.Having reached the 1966 World Cup final and 2020 Euros final at Wembley, making it to Berlin next Sunday would be England’s first final away from home soil.To get there they will almost certainly have to find more intensity and accuracy in attack than they showed on Saturday, but the confidence gained from another shootout win after decades of pain will be priceless.England came into the game on the back of two dire performances and, though they showed more invention and movement, there was again little end product, and with the Swiss equally cautious, there was barely a meaningful effort on goal for an hour.Switzerland, impressive victors over Italy last week and seeking their first major semi-final, took the lead when Dan Ndoye whipped in a deflected low cross with Breel Embolo stretching to poke it home.Southgate responded by immediately throwing on three substitutes – Cole Palmer, Luke Shaw and Eberechi Eze - and five minutes later energised England were level as Saka cut in from the right wing and curled a superb 20-metre left-footed shot in off the far post.In extra time England’s Declan Rice had a fizzing shot from the edge of the box brilliantly saved by a diving Yann Sommer, while Xherdan Shaqiri clipped a post direct from a corner, before the penalties that had felt inevitable almost from the start duly arrived.Switzerland had lost three of their four major tournament shootouts, while England’s famously uncomfortable record was seven defeats and two wins. \nRussia blasted the main children’s hospital in Kyiv with a missile in broad daylight on Monday and rained missiles down on other cities across Ukraine, killing at least 41 civilians in the deadliest wave of air strikes for months.Parents holding babies walked in the street outside the hospital, dazed and sobbing after the rare daylight aerial attack. Windows had been smashed and panels ripped off, and hundreds of Kyiv residents were helping to clear debris.“It was scary. I couldn’t breathe, I was trying to cover (my baby). I was trying to cover him with this cloth so that he could breathe,” Svitlana Kravchenko, 33, told Reuters.President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who stopped in Poland before heading off to Washington for a NATO summit, put the death toll at 37, including three children. More than 170 were injured.But tallies of casualties from the sites of attacks in different regions totalled at least 41.Writing on the Telegram messaging app, Zelenskiy said more than 100 buildings had been damaged, including the children’s hospital and a maternity centre in Kyiv, children’s nurseries and a business centre and homes.“The Russian terrorists must answer for this,” he wrote. “Being concerned does not stop terror. Condolences are not a weapon.”The Interior Ministry said there had also been damage in the central cities of Kryvyi Rih and Dnipro and two eastern cities.The government proclaimed a day of mourning on Tuesday for one of the worst air attacks of the war, which it said demonstrated that Ukraine urgently needed an upgrade of its air defences from its Western allies.Air defences shot down 30 of 38 missiles, the air force said.An online video obtained by Reuters showed a missile falling towards the children’s hospital followed by a large explosion. The location of the video was verified from visible landmarks.The Security Service of Ukraine identified the missile as a Kh-101 cruise missile.Kyiv’s military authorities said 27 people had died in the capital, including three children, and 82 were wounded in the main missile volley and a strike that came two hours later.DAMAGE ACROSS THE CAPITALKyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said the attack was one of the largest of the war, causing damage in seven city districts. The Health Minister said five units of the children’s hospital were damaged and children were evacuated to other facilities.Eleven were confirmed dead in the Dnipropetrovsk region and 68 were wounded, regional officials said. Three people were killed in the eastern town of Pokrovsk where missiles hit an industrial facility, the governor said.Zelenskiy, addressing a news conference in Warsaw alongside Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, called on Kyiv’s Western allies to give a firm response to the attack.“We will retaliate against these people, we will deliver a powerful response from our side to Russia, for sure. The question to our partners is: can they respond?” Zelenskiy said.The attack came a day before leaders of NATO countries were due to begin a three-day summit, with the war in Ukraine one of the focuses.US President Joe Biden said that Moscow’s deadly missile strikes in Ukraine, including on the children's hospital in Kyiv, were “a horrific reminder of Russia’s brutality”.In a statement released by the White House, Biden added that Washington and its NATO allies would be announcing new measures to strengthen Ukraine’s air defences.Diplomats said the United Nations Security Council would meet on Tuesday at the request of Britain, France, Ecuador, Slovenia and the United States.The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Türk, deplored the attacks, saying: “Among the victims were Ukraine's sickest children.”Russia’s Defence Ministry said its forces had launched strikes on defence industry targets and aviation bases.Moscow has repeatedly denied targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure, although its attacks have killed thousands of civilians since it launched its invasion in February 2022.Ukraine’s Prosecutor General said he discussed the attacks with International Criminal Court Prosecutor Karim Khan, adding that his office would be sharing evidence with the ICC.Ukraine’s Defence Minister Rustem Umerov said Ukraine still lacked enough air defences and urged Kyiv's allies to supply more systems promptly to protect cities from Russian attacks.Air Force representative Colonel Yuri Ignat said it became more difficult to repel Russian attacks as Moscow’s forces kept enhancing their bombardment tactics.“Enemy missiles are equipped with additional means, including radar and thermal traps,” Ignat wrote on Facebook.The missiles flew at extremely low altitudes during Monday’s attacks, he said.DTEK, the largest private power producer, said three electricity substations and networks had been damaged in Kyiv.The power system has already sustained so much damage from targeted Russian air strikes that began in March that electricity cuts have become widespread. \nFrance faced a hung parliament and the prospect of taxing negotiations starting Monday to form a government, after a surprise left-wing surge blocked Marine Le Pen’s quest to bring the far right to power.The leftist New Popular Front (NFP) emerged as the dominant force in the National Assembly after Sunday’s election, but with no single group securing a working majority the possibilities include the NFP forming a minority government or the building of a broad, unwieldy coalition.The result delivered a stinging blow to President Emmanuel Macron and leaves the euro zone’s second largest economy in limbo, heralding a period of political instability just weeks before Paris hosts the Olympic Games.Macron ended up with a hugely fragmented parliament, in what is set to weaken France’s role in the European Union and further afield, and make it hard for anyone to push through a domestic agenda.The left won 182 seats, Macron’s centrist alliance 168 and Le Pen’s National Rally (RN) and allies 143, interior ministry data cited by Le Monde newspaper showed.Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said he would tender his resignation, but it was not clear whether the president would accept it immediately, given the daunting task ahead to form a government. Attal said he would be willing to stay on in a caretaker role.“I will of course do my duties as long as it’s needed - it cannot be otherwise on the eve of a date (the Olympics) that is so important for our country,” Attal said as it became clear Macron’s alliance had endured a humbling setback.Parties from the NFP—made up of the French Communist Party, hard left France Unbowed, the Greens and the Socialist Party—met overnight for first talks on how to proceed.France Unbowed’s firebrand leader Jean-Luc Melenchon said the new prime minister should hail from NFP. However, the bloc has no leader, and the its parties are strongly divided over who they could select as a suitable premier.Some prominent centrist figures, including Edouard Philippe, a former prime minister under Macron, said they were ready to work on a pact to ensure a stable government.The euro fell on Sunday after the vote projections were announced.“There’s really going to be a vacuum when it comes to France’s legislative ability,” said Simon Harvey, head of FX analysis at Monex Europe in London.For Le Pen’s RN, the result was a far cry from weeks during which opinion polls consistently projected it would win comfortably.The left and centrist alliances cooperated after the first round of voting last week by pulling scores of candidates from three-way races to build a unified anti-RN vote.In his first reaction, RN leader Jordan Bardella, Le Pen’s protege, called the cooperation between anti-RN forces a “disgraceful alliance” that he said would paralyse France.Le Pen, who will likely be the party’s candidate for the 2027 presidential election, said however that Sunday’s ballot, in which the RN made major gains compared with previous elections, had sown the seeds for the future.“Our victory has been merely delayed,” she said.As darkness fell on Sunday, the statue of Marianne in Place de la Republique was lit up by fireworks amid celebrations by left-wing supporters. Marianne is a national symbol of France, representing reason, liberty and the ideals of the republic.Baptiste Fourastié, a 23-year-old designer in Place de la Republique, said, “we weren’t expecting it, neither were the polls. We are happy that the French people succeeded once more in blocking the far right.”However he was worried that they right may grow in strength and win next time if the next government is not beyond reproach.“It will be difficult with a hung parliament, but better than if it was the far right (ahead),” he said. \nJust a pat on the back by preacher “Bhole Baba” and Ramkumari said a stone in her kidney vanished. The 85-year-old gave no proof but this story and countless others of similar “miracles” led to Baba’s following rocketing in India’s northern states.A gathering addressed by the former police head constable in a crowded field last week drew a quarter of a million people and caused one of the deadliest stampedes in the country.Bhole Baba, or Innocent Elder, was born Suraj Pal Singh Jatav. He quit the police in 2000 to join a series of Hindu preachers and gurus in India who are sought by millions for miracle cures and spiritual advice. They are often called godmen, and many have been wooed by politicians for the influence they wield.Their patrons have included international celebrities like the Beatles, who spent days in the ashram of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in the late 1960s. Some of these gurus expanded beyond India, most famously Osho, who lived and preached in the United States in the early 1980s.Almost all of them are credited by their followers with miraculous powers.“I had gone to one of his early gatherings and told him I had chronic pain from a kidney stone for many months,” said Ramkumari, Baba’s former neighbour in Bahadurnagar village in India’s Uttar Pradesh state, where he was born and still has a home.The village has only about 50 homes in all and is set amid fields which grow corn, wheat and rice. On the periphery is a sprawling, pearly-white ashram run by devotees of Baba.“He smiled and blessed me with a pat on the back. The stone vanished soon after,” said Ramkumari, who gave just one name.Another resident in the village, 55-year-old Surajmukhi, said Baba’s blessing helped her give birth to a son after seven daughters. Sons are sought after in many Indian families.“We desperately wanted a boy,” said Surajmukhi. “Then I met Baba with my husband. He made me chant some mantras (verses), gave me some water to drink and patted me on my back. After nine months I had a baby boy.”Lying on a cot next to her, Baba’s older sister Sonkali, thin and frail, said: “It was a miracle”.Baba, formally known as Narayan Sakar Hari now, is estimated to be about 72 by his family and followers, who are spread across India’s heartland states of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh.Line to godTwo neighbours who have known him since his childhood, including Ramkumari, said he took the path after a dream one night about 25 years ago that a divine spirit had given him supernatural powers. He quit the police in the city of Agra and started preaching, they said.Baba would later claim he had a direct line to God and could channel divine blessings to people.“Soon after we saw a line of cars bringing Suraj Pal into the village and people said he would henceforth be called a Baba (elder),” Ramkumari said.Reuters could not contact Baba. He told Reuters partner ANI that he was grieving and his aides would help the injured and the families of the deceased.The stampede at his gathering on Tuesday killed 121 people, mostly women, and injured scores out of about 250,000 who had congregated in a canopied paddy field to listen to him, many trampling over one another as they ran after his car when he was leaving.Police say authorities had allowed only 80,000 to attend, and have arrested six aides to Baba who were involved in organising the event. The main organiser surrendered to police on Friday.Police said that in the initial days of his rise to fame, Baba had claimed that he could bring the dead back to life and even tried to take away the body of a 16-year-old girl from a crematorium promising a miracle to the family. Police intervened and the matter was closed soon after.Posters and videos posted on YouTube show him dressed in traditional Indian kurta tunics or pristine white suits and ties, often sporting sunglasses, a departure from the spartan image of most godmen.Still, his clout is smaller than other gurus and godmen in India, including Sri Sri Ravi Shankar and Sadhguru. Yoga guruBaba Ramdev, known to be close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, runs the Patanjali consumer goods brand that has boomed in recent years.Two godmen, Asaram Bapu and Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, were both convicted of rape in separate cases and jailed, after years of drawing thousands of devotees to their sermons and ashrams.Give people hopeSociologists say such gurus are often believed to possess healing powers, and are especially popular among those who are poor, sick or feel underprivileged.“People are insecure - economically, socially and otherwise,” said Dipti Ranjan Sahu, head of sociology at the University of Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh.“Unemployment, deprivation, discrimination, ignorance, illiteracy - these things play a part. So they see hope in the godmen, maybe some miracle will happen.”Surinder Singh Jodhka, who teaches social sciences at New Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru University and has researched on the subject, said “people are kind of looking for some meaning in their life” and that’s where godmen come in.“People are feeling lost and they are looking for some sense through which they can identify with other people, they feel less lonely,” he said. “This gives them hope and they are willing to believe in it.” \nHamas is waiting for a response from Israel on its ceasefire proposal, two officials from the Palestinian group said on Sunday, five days after it accepted a key part of a US plan aimed at ending the nine-month war in Gaza.“We have left our response with the mediators and are waiting to hear the occupation’s response,” one of the two Hamas officials told Reuters, asking not to be named.The three-phase plan was put forward at the end of May by US President Joe Biden and is being mediated by Qatar and Egypt. It aims to end the war and free around 120 Israeli hostages being held by Hamas.Another Palestinian official, with knowledge of the ongoing ceasefire deliberations, said Israel was in talks with the Qataris.“They have discussed with them Hamas’ response and they promised to give them Israel’s response within days,” the official, who asked not to be named, told Reuters on Sunday.Israel’s government made no immediate comment on the timing of its deliberations.Hamas, which controls Gaza, has dropped a key demand that Israel first commit to a permanent ceasefire before signing an agreement. Instead, it said it would allow negotiations to achieve that throughout the six-week first phase, a Hamas source told Reuters on Saturday on condition of anonymity because the talks are private.A Palestinian official close to the peace efforts has said the proposal could lead to a framework agreement if embraced by Israel and would end the war.US Central Intelligence Agency Director William Burns will travel to Qatar next week for negotiations, a source familiar with the matter said.The conflict, triggered by an October 7 attack on Israel by Hamas fighters, has claimed the lives of more than 38,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials.Hamas killed 1,200 people and took around 250 hostages in the worst assault in Israel’s history, according to official Israeli figures.FIFTEEN KILLED IN GAZA STRIKESProtesters took to the streets across Israel on Sunday to pressure the government to reach an accord to bring back Israeli hostages still being held in Gaza.They blocked rush hour traffic at major intersections across the country, picketed politicians’ houses and briefly set fire to tyres on the main Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway before police cleared the way.Meanwhile, fighting continued to rage across Gaza, which has been largely reduced to rubble in the conflict.Palestinian health officials said at least 15 people were killed in separate Israeli military strikes across the enclave on Sunday.An Israeli air strike on a house in the town of Zawayda, in central Gaza, killed at least six people and wounded several others, while six others were killed in an air strike on a house in western Gaza, the health officials said.Tanks deepened their raids in central and northern areas of Rafah on the southern border with Egypt. Health officials there said they had recovered three bodies of Palestinians killed by Israeli fire in the eastern part of the city.The Israeli military said on Sunday its forces have killed 30 Palestinian gunmen in Rafah during close combat and air strikes.In Shejaia, an eastern suburb of Gaza City, the military said its forces killed several Palestinian gunmen, and located weapons and explosives.The armed wings of Hamas and the Islamic Jihad said fighters attacked Israeli forces in several locations across the Gaza Strip with anti-tank rockets and mortar bombs. \nNepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) \nBharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality’s ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via ‘tallo bato’—backdoor route—and that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal. \nGyanumaya BK had been suffering from severe backaches for a while. The resident of Pokhara-15, BK visited the Metrocity Hospital in Srijanachowk seeking treatment five months ago. The 69-year-old, who works as a labourer, has already spent over Rs50,000 on follow-up checkups and medications.BK spent eight days in the hospital in January and has been paying off loans she had taken to pay her bills and for follow-up visits to the hospital. Had BK been aware of the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020, which private hospitals must adhere to, she wouldn’t have had to borrow money to pay her medical bills. As per the regulations, hospitals must set aside 10 percent of their total beds to the underprivileged and needy.“I didn’t know hospitals were required to provide free treatment to those who can’t afford hospital stays,” BK said. “But even if I did, I would have to fight to get the service as the hospital won’t willingly offer me the service.”The Pokhara-based 50-bed hospital’s Chief Executive Officer Gyan Prasad Aryal admits that his hospital does not adhere to the mandate. “We don’t have explicit information from the health ministry on the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020,” said Aryal. “Moving forward, we will follow the instructions.” The hospital authorities say they give a 10-15 percent discount on the final hospital bill as opposed to dedicating 10 percent of their beds and free treatment and medications to the less privileged. Hospitals with 15 beds come under the jurisdiction of the local units while those with up to 50 beds fall under the ambit of the Provincial Health Directorate. Likewise, the Provincial Health Ministry oversees health facilities with over 50 beds.However, no regulatory body has data on whether health facilities are following government rules, especially Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. But it is an open secret that most private hospitals in Pokhara are not following the regulations.Pokhara Municipality Health Department Officer Yadunath Baral, Kaski District Health Officer Bhim Prasad Poudel, and Province Health Director Khim Bahadur Khadka all admit that local hospitals disregard the regulations. “Our monitoring and inspection is also lax, that’s why most hospitals ignore the rules,” he said. He says lack of manpower hampers effective inspection. “Our manpower is enough to conduct inspections in other districts, but not in Kaski, which has many private hospitals,” he said. “We need more people for that”. According to Baral, although the hospitals claim to offer a certain discount on final bills to the needy, they are unable to show the record of the discounts provided. “The hospitals claim they give discounts, but most hospitals have not even been able to show us the proof,” said Khadka. “Legal actions should be taken against the hospitals that fail to submit a monthly report on the free services for the poor. More importantly, they must be liable for flouting government standards that aim to benefit the poor.” The Provincial Health Directorate also does not have any data on the directive’s implementation at hospitals with more than 50 beds.The department’s chief of health services Dr Ramesh KC says that they have been working on updating information of health services in the Gandaki region. “Hospitals have failed to submit their mandatory monthly reports. We will seek that information when they come for new permits or permit renewal,” KC said. There are 27 privately-owned hospitals within the Pokhara Metropolitan City and 39 in the Gandaki region. Bharatpur Metropolitan City in Chitwan in Bagmati Province is also called the ‘medical city’  as it is home to 23 private hospitals with a total of 1,200 beds. Additionally, there are multiple large-scale government hospitals and two medical colleges—Chitwan Medical College and College of Medical Sciences—that also provide medical services. Had the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020 been followed by the 23 private hospitals, 120 patients would have received free health services every year, according to Durgadutta Chapagain, chief of the Chitwan Health Office.“Although the hospitals claim they provide the services, none have been able to provide convincing proof. Instead, we found them giving such discounts to patients who are close to hospital operators,” said Chapagain. “Our department validates the permits for new health facilities and re-registrations for hospitals with a 25-bed capacity. We have asked such public health service providers to put up posters or stickers reading ‘Discounts for the needy’ on the hospital premises so that patients know what services they can get on discount.”Meanwhile, Bikram Adhikari, Secretary of the Private Hospitals Coordination Committee in Chitwan, claims that the regulations are impractical. “There are a few services that hospitals can provide free of cost. You cannot expect hospitals to provide all services for free. That’s why there is a need to amend the existing regulations,” said Adhikari.The monitoring bodies’ inaction and lackadaisical approach to ensuring that public health services are accessible and affordable to all makes private hospitals blatantly ignore government mandates.Bharatpur Metropolitan City’s Deputy Mayor Chitrasen Adhikari says that although the metropolis is aware that private hospitals must allocate 10 percent of their beds for free treatment of poor people, the metropolis administration has yet to devise a monitoring mechanism. “We have not taken any steps towards that end, but we will soon,” he said.Just like Pokhara and Chitwan, Biratnagar is also plagued with the same problem. There are 32 private hospitals currently in operation in the metropolis. Deepak Bhattarai, statistical officer at the municipality’s health office, asserts that none of the health facilities met the set requirements. A monthly report submitted by the Biratnagar-based Nobel Medical College and Teaching Hospital, which has 750 beds, stated that the hospital had provided the said concession to more than 400 patients. “However, the report did not clarify how many of the 400 patients were provided free hospital beds and the services that come along with the beds, and how many were given discounts on their hospital bills,” Bhattarai said. “We found that hospital reports also include concessions provided to patients who sought outpatient, emergency, and X-ray services.”The hospital’s director Narayan Dahal claims to be following all government instructions. He says 10 percent hospital beds are set aside for needy patients who are not charged any treatment fees, while 10 percent of service seekers also get discounts.Although the Biratnagar Metropolis has directed all health facilities under its jurisdiction to allocate free beds and provide free services to the needy, inform service seekers about the government-provided services, and submit a list of all patients who have received the services, the directive is ignored more often than followed. According to Bhattarai, medical establishments must get a letter from the local unit before making any upgrades or purchasing any equipment. “But the hospitals have been found presenting fake documents in order to acquire such permits,” he said. “The metropolis has refused such permits to 12 private hospitals in the current fiscal year.”Butwal Sub-Metropolitan City in the Lumbini Province has also taken no concrete step to ensure private hospitals adhere to Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. Despite having the authority to carry out inspections, the sub-metropolis’ apathy has deprived hundreds of needy patients of various government services. The sub-metropolis with 17 wards has more than two dozen big hospitals in the Butwal bazaar area itself. Not one of them adheres to the government’s health regulations. But the sub-metropolis is yet to monitor these hospitals. Yubraj Pandey, chief of Butwal Sub Metropolitan’s health department, says they have been unable to inspect medical institutes due to a lack of a proper set of rules.“I have just been transferred here. Discussions are underway to prepare legal requirements,” he said. Private hospitals in Butwal only began filing their reports two months ago after a joint meeting, informs Chief of the Sub Metropolitan’s Education and Health Department Mitramani Khanal. Twenty-year-old Suraj BK of Sarawal Rural Municipality-2 in West Nawalparasi got into a motorcycle accident on April 26. He suffered injuries on both his legs and was taken to Zenus Hospital and Research Centre in Butwal. Suraj was handed a bill of Rs 70,000 for treatment but he did not have the money to clear the bill and sought the hospital’s help. “The hospital refused to provide any discount. They in fact refused to discharge me. I got my discharge papers only four days later after I paid almost Rs 100,000,” he said. “I had to get a loan to pay the hospital bills as my father, who is a farmer, did not have that kind of money.”Dr Sharda Singh, the hospital director, said Suraj did not qualify for a discount as he did not have a recommendation letter from the local unit. “Patients have to get a recommendation to avail of free services at private hospitals but Suraj could not bring one,” she said. “I was in the hospital bed for four days. I could not have secured a recommendation from the local unit in that state,” said Suraj. Ishwari Prasad Chapagain, a civil society leader of Rupandehi and a member of the Consumer Interest Protection Forum, says private hospitals in Butwal are more interested in making money than helping those in need. “They do not follow government mandates. They act as if they have to bear the expenses of providing free service to the poor when in fact they get tax rebates and such for such services,” he said. “The sub-metropolis also does not do the needful. Everyone is corrupt including the city officials.”  \nUniversities worldwide are facing different crises, ranging from constricting finances to dwindling student numbers and diminishing academic autonomy. Nepali universities cannot be expected to remain independent of the global and local environments. Some of the challenges they face are unique, and so they require tailor-made responses.As the number of students opting to study abroad increases yearly, Nepali universities are scrambling to fill their seats. Recent data from the Ministry of Education show that Nepali students sent Rs104.25 billion as tuition fees to foreign universities in the first 10 months of Fiscal Year 2023-24, as per the Nepal Rashtra Bank. Such payments stood at Rs112.52 billion and Rs75.14 billion, respectively, in the same period of the previous year.A whopping 97,000 students have obtained the no-objection certificate (NOC) for education abroad in the first nine months of FY 2023-24. A total of 110,000 and 113,000 students obtained NOC in fiscal years 2022-23 and 2021-22, respectively, a 300 percent rise in a decade, as per the ministry.These figures are staggering. Even as they show a dangerous trend of the country’s exodus of human capital and financial resources, they leave us with the question: How do Nepali universities survive? As the students leave the country in droves, universities face half-filled classrooms and depleting financial resources. For now, publicly funded universities like Tribhuvan University and Nepal Sanskrit University may not have to worry about their finances. However, self-funding universities like Kathmandu University (KU) and Pokhara University, which largely sustain on tuition fees, face an existential question as the number of students falls and their earnings plummet.Diversifying revenue sourcesFor university administrators, not having to worry about financial problems is a great advantage, for one can concentrate on academics and research, the major functions of the university. Kathmandu University faced this gruelling question of long-term financial sustainability, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. Technically, the university was not likely to face a financial crisis in the short run, even during the pandemic, for it had a comfortable financial cushion. But we could foresee a looming crisis in case the pandemic dragged on. We could not expect students to continue paying tuition fees if the income sources of their parents or guardians took a hit. In any case, KU generates only 60 percent of its revenue from tuition fees, while it receives about 10 percent of funding from the government. Exploring funding sources for the remaining 30 percent is a persistent challenge, as an unhindered university operation hinges on this.Diversifying funding sources is crucial to the financial sustainability of universities, particularly those not publicly funded. It is also critical for the autonomy of academic governance. Despite having to keep an eye on the financial resources all the time, one advantage of receiving a minuscule amount of funding from the government is that universities can exercise relatively better academic freedom, ranging from faculty appointment to curriculum design and research. But how are we to diversify financial sources when the student numbers are coming down and the country's economic growth is nearly stagnant year after year?This is where the endowment model comes in as a major funding source, even for Nepal's self-funded universities.Endowment modelGlobally, endowments form a successful model for diversifying funding sources in universities. Thousands of universities worldwide run on different kinds of endowment funds institutions and individuals provide. Usually, a portion of the earnings from the endowments is used towards running costs or specific university projects, thus ensuring long-term financial security for the university. The US-based Harvard University has 14,000 endowments today, with the total size exceeding $50.7 billion. The endowments contributed $2.2 billion to the university's operating budget in 2023 alone. Stanford University's endowment fund was valued at $36.3 billion in 2023, with the endowment payout standing at $1.74 billion, covering 23 percent of the university's operating expenses. Top American universities continue to tap the goodwill of donors and alumni to strengthen their financial standing. These generous endowments allow the universities to pay their faculty and staff well, fund their students' tuition and research and innovate.Culturally, endowment is not a new concept in Nepal. The guthi system has been in operation for centuries, where the community chips in resources to fund initiatives that are especially relevant to community work. The Newar community in the Kathmandu Valley and elsewhere is the best example of communities coming together to finance their common objectives. The guthis established by wealthy rulers, business persons and landowners in the past helped educate a significant number of Nepalis in Indian cities like Benares and Calcutta. The Madan Puraskar Library, offering two scholarships every year for studying medicine in Calcutta, is a continuation of this culture. The Rajkiya Sanskrit School in Matihani, Mahottari and the Ramswarup Ramsagar Multiple Campus in Janakpur, Dhanusha are some examples of endowments strengthening Nepal's education system.Public-spirited individuals who wanted to contribute to Nepal's future through education laid the financial foundation of KU in its formative years. These individuals include a businessman named Rana Bahadur Shah, who helped build the university's library and offered his mansion in Lazimpat to set up the university’s offices in its initial days. As a gesture of gratitude to Shah, the university founded the Rana Bahadur Shah Gold Medal fund. The university continued to receive generous funds from individuals and institutions along the way, with notable contributions from its alumni as well as businesspersons and philanthropists, including Mohan Gopal Khetan, Gopal Rajbhandari, Juddha Bahadur Shah, Krishna KC, and Prof. Bidya Nath Koirala. Growing endowmentsAcquiring endowments and making them grow requires a systemic approach to financial management. KU’s efforts at organising dedicated fundraising programmes and strategically mobilising its surplus funds have been quite successful. The number of endowment funds has grown from around 12 to 53 in the past three and a half years, and the size of the fund has grown over tenfold, from around Rs60 million to Rs650 million. This growth has helped set up scholarships, fellowships, medals, awards, and educational loans for students while also strengthening the capacity of faculty and staff.The sources of such endowments have been pretty diverse—from individuals offering money in memory of their loved ones to national and international institutions providing funds, alumni giving back to their university, and faculty transferring the earnings and savings from external research projects. To ensure steady growth from the endowments, universities can follow the conservative route of investing in fixed deposits at “A Class” commercial banks that offer competitive interest rates and investment security. One way to utilise this scheme is to spend 50 percent of the income from interests and reinvest the remaining amount in the principal investment. However, conservative investments such as bank interests come with fluctuating returns. Diversifying the investment portfolio by investing in non-collateralised assets while devising clear guidelines and risk-hedging strategies is paramount. The experiment with the endowment model has proved to be a significant alternative funding model for KU. This could be a blueprint for self-funding and even public universities in Nepal, especially if we can incorporate international fund management practices for sustainable operation and growth through endowments. \nDemocracies are no better than other forms of government at avoiding catastrophic mistakes. But they are much more effective at rectifying them. While the 2024 British general election might have seemed a long time coming, as the country meandered from one failure to the next, the utter scale of defeat for the Conservatives is testament to the ability of a democratic system to reject, reverse and renew.It also places a singular challenge on the desk of the new prime minister, Keir Starmer. He will be judged by his ability to restore probity to government and address the damage suffered by the country.It is easy to see this election in the tradition of other big defeats like 1997 or 1979 or 1964. A powerful theme of “time for a change” was at play and the governing party seemed to have run out of steam. It can even be interpreted as sending a powerful message to Rishi Sunak’s Conservative party that voters wanted to inflict punishment for incompetence, economic mismanagement and sleaze.But this one is more than that.The now former governing party, returned with a majority of 80 in 2019, has been beaten to within an inch of its life. A generation of politicians long criticised for treating public life with contempt, have been ejected from office and parliament.Step back, and this election can be seen as democracy rectifying the catalogue of its own glaring mistakes. Since the calamitous Brexit referendum eight years ago, Britain has suffered economic decay and a cost of living crisis (briefly exacerbated by Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng’s disastrous so-called “mini-budget”).It has endured a government with a lengthy record of rule breaking reflected in the UK falling to its lowest ever ranking in the Global Corruption Index. It has seen dodgy pandemic procurement contracts handed out, party donors appointed to the House of Lords and a sustained attack on its constitution, institutions, and rule of law. Tiresome culture war crusades have divided communities and polluted public life.Denigration of public services from education to the NHS to the armed forces, crises in housing, the climate and inequality have been left unchallenged. Damage has been done to the country’s international reputation and relations strained with the UK’s closest allies in Europe.What these errors have in common is that each one sits firmly at the door of 10 Downing Street and its four most recent inhabitants. This election emphatically draws a line under them.Parties can fallFor so long in opposition and even during this campaign, Starmer’s party has danced to the populist tune of the government and its media cheerleaders. The challenge for his new administration as it takes power is to recognise that this election is a watershed, a rejection of this catalogue of mistakes, and an expectation of political renewal.The more existential question is whether this election is also a watershed moment that will permanently change the shape of British politics. Could we be witnessing the demise of the Conservative party and the end of its hegemonic position at the centre of public life?It happened to the previously dominant Liberal party a century ago when it split down the middle and was replaced by a new emerging Labour party. Such a shift is rare, of course, and requires some sort of major disruption.In the years following the fist world war, Labour’s rise was fuelled by an extension in the franchise so significant that it makes the proposed votes for today’s 1.5 million 16 and 17-year-olds appear trifling. Indeed the Representation of the People acts more than doubled the electorate by giving the vote to women and the 40 percent of (working-class) men who were also previously disenfranchised.There is nothing quite so seismic heading Westminster’s way today (though plans for automatic registration could add millions of voters). But the potential for comparison should not be dismissed.Post-Brexit realignment, realignedParty identification in the electorate, which has been in decline since the 1960s was turned on its head in 2019 when Boris Johnson’s Tories won a swathe of red wall seats in the Midlands and the north of England. For the first time, Labour voters were wealthier than Conservative. Labour, of course, went down to its worst defeat since 1935. There was talk of a new political cleavage, where class divisions had been replaced by leavers and remainers.That this has all been reversed in the space of one parliament demonstrates the incredible fluidity in the electorate today. The more than 70 seats that have gone to the Liberal Democrats show the determination of the electorate to vote tactically to remove Conservatives in spite of an electoral system that has historically kept them in office.And then there is Reform. Nigel Farage’s rag bag of a party has proved to be the ultimate protest vote for disenchanted Tory voters, attracted to the open acknowledgement that few if any seats could be won but the higher the vote, the harder the beating for the Conservatives.As it happens, millions more voted Reform than was reflected in their seat share. While there are some leading Tories who would still welcome him into the fold, Farage perhaps overplayed his hand during the campaign making the Conservatives defensive of a rival, hell bent on their destruction. Time will tell if the Conservatives can resist the onslaught but for now the psychodrama of the right will be a political sideshow to the main event: An innocent new government and a refreshed parliament.Britain’s parliamentary democracy facilitated this catalogue of mistakes which have proved so damaging to the country over recent years. But in this election it has also proved highly effective at beginning the work to rectification. If Starmer gets a moment to catch his breath, he might reflect upon this as the key reason he has been handed such a decisive majority.—The Conversation \nThe birth centenary of former prime minister and Nepali Congress president Girija Prasad Koirala alias Girija Babu (1924-2010) was marked on July 4, 2024. The centenary occasion evoked my memories and impressions about him. Though I never met him, I saw him at the momentous moments of history. This is a short visceral piece written mainly to mark Girija Babu's birth centenary. Since I am not a political scientist or knew him closely, I have not made attempts to analyse Girija Babu's politics and his sense of victory and loss in his life. His party has made some attempts towards that. I also edited a short text of an obituary sent to me shortly after his death by Sujata Koirala, whom I have met once.By all standards, it is an important day not only for the party he led but also for all who especially remember the important modes of transition in Nepali history. Girija Babu is remembered for a couple of very important metamorphoses that this country experienced—the signing of the comprehensive peace agreement with the Maoist guerrillas in 2006 and the abolition of monarchy in Nepal. These historical occasions resulted from the transitions that the Nepali people had brought about especially from the year 1990. Girija Babu was the prime minister of Nepal during that period. We can mention the four occasions when he became the prime minister. The years when he headed the governments were crucial moments in Nepali history—1991 to 1994, 1998 to 1999, 2000 to 2001, and 2006 to 2008. He also became acting head of state between January 2007 and July 2008 as the country was in a very important mode of change. History had bequeathed that onus on him.Girija Babu worked with the cohorts for the promotion of the democratic values as espoused by his brother, late BP Koirala, and other leaders of different parties. The people who worked with democratic commitments to various modes of modernisation know that the process of history is not simple. Though they have been working with new ideas, they know that the forces that work against such innovative spirit are far from defeated. Fareed Zakaria, in his recently published book, Age of Revolutions: Progress and Backlash From 1600 to the Present (2024), cogently analyses this subject in a historical context. Zakaria also reveals the challenging and interesting problematics of the day. Girija Babu, as the title of his book Simple Convictions (2010) shows, was not a very learned person. But his commitment to democratic values was very important and remarkable. The subtitle of the book \"My struggle for peace and democracy\", tends to spell that out. This book covers the period between the takeover by King Gyanendra Shah in October 2002 to the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement with the Maoists in 2006. Girija Babu called that event \"the last struggle of my life\". The title of Kanak Dixit's “Preface” to Simple Convictions, \"GP: Man of the moment\", foregrounds the same feature. But history is the most powerful force behind Girija Babu's pragmatism he practised without espousing any of its philosophical aspects of thinking. The history of democratic struggle shaped the flow of his moments, to use the Buddhist terminology. I was asked to speak at the launch of the book on March 21, 2010, by its publisher Madhab Lal Mharjan of Mandala Book Point. Not being a Congress Party person or a political theorist, I spoke like a literary writer and theatre person that created similar effect on the occasion. I felt inspired to speak about the book because of its candidness and simplicity. I had even used the term “subalternity” to describe some of GP Koirala's modus operandi while commenting on the book.I want to mention another event that evokes my memory of Girija Babu. It was the occasion of the 14th SAARC Summit held in New Delhi on 13 April 2007. The Summit was being held at Vigyan Bhawan and our SAARC literary conference was being held at writer Ajeet Cour's Art Academy. The same date was a coincidence and had nothing to do with our conference. Girija Babu participated in and addressed the SAARC summit. He was seen there as a successful prime minister, and a peacemaker who had worked with other parties to put an end to the Maoist insurgency through peaceful negotiation. Using supplemental oxygen, Girija Babu looked in Delhi like someone fighting to fulfil a mission for peace and stability; he had attracted the attention of politicians and the media.Girija Babu died on March 20, 2010, at the residence of his daughter, Sujata Koirala, in Mandikhatar. My colleague and student Shiva Rijal and I reached there very early in the morning and stood outside, overlooking the compound. Politicians like Krishna Prasad Bhattarai, Pushpa Kamal Dahal and others came and went. We heard Dahal calling “Girijababu!” loudly and saw Kisunji leaving in a sombre mood. Narayan Wagle, the then editor of Nagarik Daily, asked me to write an obituary of Girija Babu. I am citing the following lines from the obit, which was published the following day. \"Can we say Girija Babu's death marks the end of an era? The answer to this question is not easy, because he departed not by ending an era but by heralding a fresh continuation. In other words, his death did not mark the end of a period in history; instead, it ushered a complex time to manage. We can see that a number of things go with the death of those who have played important roles in history. Liminal lines separate them. But Girija Babu's death put them alongside.\"I recited a poem written on Girija Babu's death at the SAARC literary conference in Delhi the following year. I cite lines from a few stanzas: That was a daywhen he like any otherSouth Asian makers of historygently went into a sleepbehind a lawn where I waswatching sparrows tickle the backof a nondescript morningthat matured into a gloomy day…when the last words in a text were putunder history's unblinking eyes. …In demise of this man;I don't knowif my words would have made sense to himbecause he was a simple farmerwho planted sky with dreams intactin these turbulent fields. …I don't knowif these farmershave lived long enough toreap the harvests of their dream seedsunder the familiar skieswhere we have all invested our dreams.Girija Prasad Koirala played out poetry in history without being close to the Muse. \nCOVID-19 still poses a threat globally, with Nepal experiencing a spike in Omicron sub-lineages and deaths continuing worldwide; vaccination campaigns aim to protect vulnerable groups, including immunocompromised children and the elderly.\nThe Nepali Congress and CPN-UML formed a government, sidelining Pushpa Kamal Dahal and the Rastriya Swatantra Party, which faces internal turmoil after its short-lived coalition experience.\nAmidst distrust, Nepali Congress and CPN-UML leaders Deuba and Oli formed a midnight pact to establish a new government, displacing Dahal's administration and raising questions about democratic principles and loyalty.\nNepal's Congress and UML form a coalition government under Oli's leadership, aiming to implement constitutional amendments focused on political stability, economic growth, and governance.\nOver 52% of students failed the SEE due to poor teaching quality and an unprepared letter grading system implementation, leading to concerns about the test system and the need for teacher training and curriculum updates.\nThe government’s recent decision to recall ambassadors, particularly Nepal’s envoy to India, just ahead of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s visit to New Delhi, courted widespread controversy. What are the takeaways of the prime minister’s Delhi visit? What is the progress in implementing the trade and transit agreement signed with China and with the BRI projects? Thira Lal Bhusal of the Post sat down with Rupak Sapkota, foreign affairs advisor to the prime minister, for some insights.The government’s decision to recall ambassadors from 11 countries at once has come under heavy criticism. Why did the government take such a decision?In general, it has become a practice of sorts to recall incumbent ambassadors and appoint new ones after changes in the government or in the ruling coalition. This has both merits and demerits. The country’s foreign policy doesn’t change with a change in government. But every government and coalition has its specific policies, programmes and priorities. Therefore, even other countries make changes in political appointments as per the government’s priorities. Our case is a bit different. Ruling coalitions are frequently changed, and so are ambassadors. As there is a high chance of our politics being governed by coalitions given our electoral system, it has become necessary to establish a rational system on ambassadorial appointment. Either the political appointees themselves should voluntarily quit the job and return home just like vice-chair and members of the National Planning Commission do. Or there should be a consensus among major political forces to allow our ambassadors to serve out the full term.The second option of allowing ambassadors to serve out their term sounds better, doesn’t it?Definitely. Some initiatives have been taken with the objective of making our diplomatic appointments more prestigious, merit-based and better-managed. The government in 2019 introduced some criteria on ambassadorial appointments. We have to put more effort into ensuring that our ambassadorial appointees have the capacity to effectively carry out diplomatic duties. Once we establish a system of appointing envoys based on merit and not out of political biases, we can create a situation of allowing them to serve for the full term. Then, a change of coalition wouldn’t affect their continuity. We need to develop such a political consensus, given our geopolitical sensitivity.But the ambassadors appointed in recent years and their activities in host countries have lowered the bar of our diplomacy.We have seen rapid and huge changes in power equations in the world. In view of that, we can see some countries have appointed former ministers and even prime ministers as envoys to the countries with whom they have vital relations. They also appoint such personalities as envoys for a special mission. So, we have to think about ambassadorial appointments from different perspectives based on the changed context. It is high time that all the political forces and leaders agree on a basic point that those who have in-depth understanding and expertise of the field and can work for the best interest of the country will be appointed the country’s ambassadors. If the individual is competent, the person’s affiliation to a political party may not be a problem. But whether the person can work in the best interest of the country must be considered before appointment.But the government itself doesn’t seem serious about maintaining diplomatic decorum. For instance, the June 6 Cabinet meeting decided to recall the ambassador from India just days ahead of the prime minister’s New Delhi visit. There were also reports that the prime minister made the decision reluctantly due to pressure from coalition partners. What is the real story?It is nothing more than a coincidence. There were discussions about making changes in the ambassadorial positions in line with the March 4 changes in the ruling coalition. But it was deferred as the government needed to accomplish some important tasks and convene events such as the investment summit. When the government decided to change our ambassadors, it just happened to coincide with the prime minister’s visit to New Delhi to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It was a coincidence. Despite the decision, the ambassador had sufficient time to properly conclude all his engagements and duties there. The way he facilitated the process during the prime minister’s visit doesn’t reflect any misgivings about the government’s decision. So, it should be taken as a course that is in keeping with our tradition. In recent decades, other countries have given top priority to economic diplomacy, but the selection of our envoys and their activities doesn’t reflect that. Why aren’t we thinking in that direction?Yes, diplomacy in the past used to be one-dimensional, or it was conducted mainly by one particular ministry—the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. These days, many other ministries are engaged with international agencies. Economic diplomacy, labour diplomacy, climate diplomacy and security affairs have become crucial. We have to increase coordination, cooperation and collaboration among relevant agencies to make our international relations more fruitful and in line with the policies and goals set by our government.We have seen profound changes in terms of approaches, perspectives and dynamics of diplomacy in recent decades. All countries have started to give more importance to the competence of diplomats also in view of the increased geopolitical competition and rivalry seen between world powers. Rapid innovation in science and technology has not only eased our lives but also added challenges. We have to handle so many diplomatic engagements. Similarly, the number of international forums where we have to engage are increasing. These days, multilateral diplomacy and engagements have become as important. Even minilateral forums have started to play vital roles in international relations as the world powers have adopted multiple strategies to create their spheres of influence. In the meantime, the role of public diplomacy has become influential. So, a diplomat today must be dynamic and efficient enough to grasp the international situation, understand the sensitivity of the host country, articulate our country’s views efficiently and work in national interest. Therefore, it has become vital to be extra careful while selecting ambassadors.You talked about better coordination but we don’t see any correction in the practice of bypassing the foreign ministry while working with international agencies.Definitely, the foreign ministry is our focal point for all international relations conducted by a ministry or agency of our country. There should be no dispute about that. We need to make the foreign ministry more resourceful. Then, the ministry will have more capacity and efficiency to handle issues related to security, finance, labour and climate.Why have we failed to maintain reciprocity in terms of diplomats’ relations with the leaders of host countries? For example, our ambassadors in some capitals don’t get to meet the host leaders for years while the foreign envoys in Kathmandu can meet our prime minister and foreign minister directly and instantly.We have to see it from two perspectives. One is the power structure. In international relations, we can see the reflection of the asymmetric power relations between the big powers and other countries. The more developed and resourceful country’s influence in a host country can be seen and felt. Second, despite being an envoy from an underdeveloped or a small country, one can have diplomatic relations based on the principle of sovereign equality. It depends on the individual diplomat as well.In Kathmandu, we often err when dealing with foreign envoys. We have to decide what level of importance to give them. Therefore, some initiatives have been taken to correct and maintain consistency by implementing a diplomatic code of conduct that aims to integrate all activities through the foreign ministry. Foreign envoys will follow the system if we implement it consistently, irrespective of changes in the government. For that, there should be a political understanding at the national level.Let’s move to Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s recent India visit. Though it was mainly to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Indian Prime Minister Modi, he held some important political meetings. What are the takeaways from the visit?The visit was important from bilateral, regional and international perspectives. Traditionally, foreign affairs was described as an extended form of domestic affairs. But these days, international affairs have influence over domestic affairs as well. So such meetings and dialogues at the prime minister’s level are important. They exchanged views in a very cordial atmosphere. Of late, we have maintained bilateral dialogues at the political level on a regular basis and that has helped remove misunderstandings. Our prime minister’s emphasis is to hold bilateral dialogues both at the political as well as diplomatic levels in order to settle differences. India has taken this spirit positively.Second, the two prime ministers discussed how to expedite the implementation of the agreements reached between Nepal and India during Prime Minister Dahal’s official visit a year ago. The issue was discussed during the meeting between Prime Minister Dahal and Indian External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar as well. They also expressed satisfaction over progress in the implementation of bilateral agreements mainly in energy trade, connectivity and investment. In recent years, we have seen progress in investment, economic and trade sectors. Yet we still have some differences on border issues. That is an important and positive development in Nepal-India relations in recent years. In the past, when we had some differences on political, border or other issues, that used to badly affect other aspects of our relations. But now, both the countries agree to resolve outstanding issues through dialogue and our trade and all other affairs are moving ahead smoothly. This is the encouraging part of our relations. But border disputes can sour our relations anytime, right? Is there a sense of urgency to resolve it once and for all?The prime minister is for activating the concerned bilateral mechanisms to resolve such issues. He has also invited Indian Prime Minister Modi to visit Nepal. We can expect the Indian prime minister’s Nepal visit in near future. We can make some progress in resolving some outstanding matters such as border issues during the high level visit. I believe we will move ahead in this direction.Any progress on submitting the report of the Eminent Persons’ Group?During the meetings, the prime minister raised overall bilateral issues that include the matter related to the EPG report. I think once the mechanisms are activated and start working, that will create a situation for the report’s submission.Nepal and Bangladesh are completing homework for greater energy trade. India’s facilitation is a must for that. Is there any progress on securing the southern neighbour’s support for that?Progress in energy cooperation is a major achievement of this tenure of the prime minister. The progress is not limited to the bilateral level but goes to the regional level. A Cabinet committee of the Bangladesh government earlier this month approved a proposal to import 40 megawatts of electricity from Nepal. At present, we will use India’s infrastructure to export energy to Bangladesh. But for the long term there is a plan to build a dedicated transmission line for that. This shows it is not only Nepal that is interested in exporting its energy but other countries in this region are also interested in importing Nepal’s electricity. We have also signed an agreement to build a cross border transmission line with China. The doors are being opened for regional trade of our energy. This development will make India more open to importing energy from Nepal.Why are we failing to expedite projects under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) of China?The economic cooperation between Nepal and China has substantially increased after we joined the BRI framework. So, Nepal has been benefitting from the BRI. We see some concern about the lack of progress on certain infrastructure projects to be built under the BRI framework. In fact, we are in a better position to implement the projects because now we can decide what kind of BRI projects are good for us based on the experience of project development and implementation under the BRI in other countries.We are working to finalise the BRI implementation agreement. Nepal wants to move ahead by signing the implementation agreement and developing the projects. Nepal joined the BRI framework based on its need to diversify trade and connect to the world market. The reality is the same now. So, we need to sign the implementation plan and move ahead as soon as possible. When I attended the Boao Forum a few months ago, I found the Chinese authorities and other stakeholders holding debates to build quality and resilient infrastructure. They also have plans to support the capacity enhancement of human resources and transfer technology in the BRI member countries.People mainly link the BRI with big infrastructure projects such as railway, road and transmission connectivity but there is no significant progress on these fronts. What are the roadblocks?In Nepal, no big infrastructure project has been completed on time, be it the Melamchi drinking project, airports, hydropower or road projects. We haven’t developed the capacity to build big projects, and we don’t envision any plan to operate after building it. So, not only with China but also with other countries and agencies, we have to seek support for small and medium-size projects that we can efficiently build and operate. Also, the third version of the BRI action plan has included building not only big but small and smart projects under the framework. We have to push for that. As we build our capacity, we can gradually take up big projects. For instance, now we can build big hydro projects on our own. It wasn’t the case until some years ago. We developed expertise in hydropower by building many small projects in the past few decades and gradually enhanced our capacity. We have already faced problems in operating the Pokhara and Bhairahawa airports. Is there any progress in taking Chinese support to operate the airports?We have to see both aspects—domestic as well as international use—of the airports. The two airports have helped us upgrade the quality of our domestic air travel as the passengers have benefited due to the upgraded infrastructure. The number of domestic passengers in these airports has increased significantly.It is true that there is no progress in terms of operating them as international airports. The government is studying all possibilities of their use based on their unique features. We are exploring various options in international markets to attract adventure tourists to Pokhara. Chinese stakeholders are also holding some promotional activities in Pokhara. Chinese authorities have told us that they are consulting with their provincial bodies and exploring possibilities to run regular flights to Pokhara. Similarly, the government is mobilising our embassies and other stakeholders in certain countries having a large number of Buddhist tourists to operate flights to Bhairahawa, and we have received some positive responses. I believe we will be able to operate regular international flights from these two airports soon.It’s been eight years since we signed the trade and transit agreement with China, which was touted as a historic deal between the two countries. Why haven’t we been able to implement it?Some symbolic steps have been taken in this period. For instance, a shipment was received from a third country [Vietnam] using a Chinese port in September last year. Similar other initiatives have been taken but these are limited to symbolic gestures. We have to prepare infrastructure and some legal basis to implement the agreements in a more result-oriented way. A bilateral meeting is being held this week. The meeting is likely to discuss how to bring the trade and transit protocol in an effective way. This meeting will discuss various issues faced so far and will also pave the way forward. We have also proposed to form a ministerial-level mechanism to oversee overall bilateral issues. The upcoming meeting will sort out various issues.The Chinese side was conducting a feasibility study of the Keirung-Kathmandu cross-border railway project. What is the progress?There is progress in various projects that we are carrying out with Chinese support. The cross-border railway feasibility study is in the final stage. Likewise, the study on the Chhahare-Tokha tunnel project is ongoing. A Chinese team is arriving to conduct a feasibility study of the Hilsa-Simkot road. A process to award a contract to build a friendly bridge at Hilsa with Chinese grants has begun. A foundation stone will be laid there soon. Also, a study to build the Chilime-Rashuwagadhi-Keirung 220kV cross-border transmission line is beginning soon. \nThe government has decided to make the National ID Card mandatory in order to receive services from government and public institutions. In the first phase, the June 6 Cabinet meeting made the National ID card number mandatory in 28 districts. People including federal lawmakers criticised the decision saying that it was enforced without first distributing the cards. In this context, Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Yubaraj Katel, director general of the Department of National ID and Civil Registration.Let’s begin with a basic question. Why do we need a National ID card while we already have citizenship certificate, driving license, passport and voting card?There is a fundamental difference between a citizenship card and National ID. Citizenship establishes whether you are a citizen of the country and it helps you identify yourself with some basic details. In Nepal, it was also widely used as a service card. Wherever you go, you have to show the citizenship card—to open a bank account or acquire a SIM card for a phone. If we study international practices, there are mainly two cards—one is an identity card and the other is a service card. In 2018, the Nepal government came up with the idea of distributing national identity cards with a unique digital number for each eligible citizen. The number can track not only the individual but also the person’s activities and movements. This project has various components. First is data collection. It has two categories—demographic data, such as the names of father, mother and other family members. Second is biometric data—fingerprints, eye retina and digital signature. The biometric data is crucial to create a unique identity of each individual and avoid duplication in the integrated national database. The National ID has these two types of data. The other tasks are enrollment of the data, printing and distribution of the cards and then providing services based on that. At present, people carry multiple cards in their pockets. The objective of this project is to replace all of them by a single card–National ID. The new card includes vital details of all other cards in its chip with 1GB storage capacity. The government wanted to trace people based on their unique individual numbers so that there is no need to print and carry multiple cards. There is a huge industry of printing separate cards for each and every service that is creating a jumble of information. The National ID will not only replace multiple cards but also help authorities control criminal activities like financial frauds by removing duplication. At present, government authorities have difficulty in tracing and identifying an individual and wrongdoers are benefitting from that situation.What cards will be replaced by the National ID?It has a chip with 1GB storage capacity where you can store your driving license, academic documents, voting card, insurance details, ATM card number, etc. For instance, if you go to a telecom company to acquire a SIM card, they will ask for a copy of your citizenship card. You can say, ‘no, I have a National ID card’. Once you give your number and fingerprint, they can immediately verify it through the system. Another objective is to help people get rid of filling up pages of forms for each service. International governance has a norm that says don’t ask citizens their information more than once. A state agency should seek the information once and provide it to other state agencies if they require it. People complain that many agencies don’t accept National ID. They still ask for a citizenship card for official record and verification. So, in practice, it didn’t help people reduce the number of cards in their pockets. In fact, it added one more.Therefore, the June 6 Cabinet decision made the use of National ID cards compulsory in 28 districts. Now, it is going to be essential to get social security allowances, pensions and claim health insurance. The Health Insurance Board has said it has become challenging for them to verify whether a claimant is the rightful one. The board has 8 million policyholders. We will give them our details. Then, they can cross-check the authenticity of a claimant. This will help avoid huge financial frauds. In fact, the government should have made it mandatory earlier.But people including lawmakers in the federal parliament have strongly opposed the decision saying that the government made National ID mandatory without first distributing the cards to the people.Nepal’s total population is over 30 million. Our principal stakeholders are citizenship card holders. Those 16-year-olds are eligible for citizenship cards. The Election Commission distributes voting cards to those above 18 years. We got the data from the commission and added 20 percent and estimated that we have 18.6 people above 16 years old. As of Friday, we have already distributed the National ID numbers to 14.9 million people. Now, as per our estimate, around 3.7 million people are yet to get the National ID. Millions of people are abroad. Thus, we are headed towards saturation point in terms of data collection and issuance of the numbers. One thing I want to stress is that people don’t need a hard copy of the National ID card. The number is sufficient. Printing cards is costly. We have to pay around 2 euro to procure a blank card. The cost of printing, delivery and other overhead expenses is added to that. With the task of printing over a billion copies of ID cards being too costly, even India discourages use of hard copy of the cards. You can create the QR code of your card, save it in your mobile or print it in a paper and scan it wherever you need it.Officials at our government agencies bring up the rule that makes it mandatory to present a physical copy of citizenship card or other documents for official works.Yes, we are trained and habituated in that way. Now we need to change. We must make offices paperless while developing a strong database system. We have been using citizenship cards to verify the identity of a person for a long time. Biometrics not only helps identify people but also trace their activities. Recently, Rs2 billion was found in the bank accounts of a 26-year-old man. The money was deposited in 56 bank accounts. He used 13 ATM cards and 17 phone numbers. Once the National ID card is implemented, transactions and movements of such wrongdoers will be easily traced and monitored. Identifying individuals accurately is crucial to ensure good governance and strengthen security. Many people have acquired fake citizenship cards. People even made fake passports. Implementation of National ID will control it. It is also related to our national image. It will help improve the status of our passport and add authenticity to our other documents as well.Once the National ID comes into wide use, our details will be traced and used by multiple agencies. State agencies and other institutions benefit from the integrated database as they can easily trace us. But how do you ensure our data isn’t misused and it doesn’t make us insecure?If you have a National ID card, you don’t need a hard copy of your driving licence. There is a backlog of around 2.1 million licences. The government has failed to print and distribute them. We told them, we have already procured 12 million cards. Of them, 3.2 million cards have already been printed and we still need to print around 8 million cards. Once the licence data is integrated with the National ID card, it will be shown there. Now, to come to your question, only the traffic authority can access the licence-related data. The device they use will trace only relevant data. Only an authorised agency will get access to the data and it can’t be used for anything other than the stated purpose. We give access to agencies like Nepal Rastra Bank, Nepal Telecommunication Authority and Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal. Then they regulate the things in their domain. No unauthorised body or individual can access it. Do the implementing agencies have infrastructure to use this technology?We are in a position to implement it in some parts of the country. Therefore, we are implementing it in phases. We are making it mandatory for certain services in 28 districts from mid-July. We should have started much earlier. It must be expedited.Lawmakers said in a Parliament meeting that the decision has ‘terrorised people’ in the 28 districts as locals feared they might be deprived of the services as the government has made National ID cards mandatory without first distributing them.We started the National ID registration process from 2018. Registration teams reached in each local ward except in Mugu and Humla districts of Karnali. It was carried out as a campaign. Even after the drive’s completion, the registration process was open in all the 77 districts, 54 area administration offices and in palika (local unit) centres. We also had registration centres in major downtowns. We receive data of around 4,000 registrations a day. So, there has been sufficient initiative and enough time to encourage people to get the number. Besides, if anyone in the 28 districts are still to get the ID number, they still have three months to register.You said only an ID number but no hard copy was needed to access any kind of service, right?Exactly. There is no provision that states one should produce a hard copy to get any service. You give the number and your biometrics to verify that you are the right person. Then, the official can crosscheck it in the database within seconds.Do all the implementing agencies have the devices that read the National ID cards?We have distributed 4,200 machines that read the cards in 333 local units of the 28 districts. Likewise, we have asked other local units and districts and some agencies such as banks to procure the devices and we have given the specifications based on their requirements. A device costs just around Rs 1,500. You can enter the number and place your thumbprint on it. We have trained relevant officials from all the local units for the purpose.How many cards can the department print at present?We can produce 1,500 cards an hour. But now we are producing only 1,800 a day. We have the strength to distribute 30,000 cards a day but are distributing only 5,000 a day.Again the same question. Then why are people not getting the cards?There is some communication gap. People who registered in 2018 or 2019 haven’t contacted us. We are giving them priority to clear the backlogs. But people who are newly-registered are showing more interest. So, we need to strike the right balance.When will the department be in a position to distribute the cards to all the people?At present, we can print 100,000 cards a month. We have a space to double the capacity. Meanwhile, people have now shown more interest. By enhancing our facilities’ capacity, we can print the pending 8 million cards in the next 40 months.What about election cards? Do we need to register for that and get the voting cards?In fact, the Election Commission doesn’t need to collect data and issue cards. We will talk to them. As a constitutional body, we have to readily make the data available for them. In fact, the National ID Card system can help the commission make voting arrangements for the Nepalis abroad because it can accurately identify the right person and can immediately update the integrated system here in Nepal about the votes cast in any country. This card will be helpful in conducting fair elections because the biometric data stored in this system will be perfect bases to identify the people and instantly update the activities in the database.You have emphasised replacement of other cards by the National ID cards. How long may it take to do so?We plan on giving priority to three sectors—banking, civil aviation and telecom. People right now need to fill separate forms for these services that have irked the service seekers. We have asked the bankers to buy the devices. We as a supplier are ready. Now the stakeholders should be ready too. It will benefit them because it helps control frauds.What if I don’t register for the National ID card?In the first place, you will be deprived of social security funds, pension, insurance policies. Likewise, the government will gradually make the card compulsory to receive many other services such as driving licence, land transaction, telephone numbers, bank accounts. How do you assure that our data stored in this system isn’t misused?See, the current practices make you more vulnerable. Because multiple agencies take your data for various purposes. Do they have a system to protect the data and ensure that it isn’t misused? But when your data is stored only by a dedicated government agency, it will be more secure as the agency is specialised for that. When other authorised agencies seek data, we give them access only to the relevant one. We have a National Identity Management Information System (NIMIS). We have maintained three layers of security—L1, L2, L3—to ensure foolproof security of the data. There are three servers.Are we dependent on any foreign company for any related service?So far, only one international vendor is involved but we are cutting down its involvement as well, with a plan to ultimately replace it by our own agency. The vendor now helps transfer collected data to the printing machine through the Automated Biometric Identification System (ABIS). But our plan is to do so through our own government agency or local vendor. We do all the other tasks. Security printing is done within the office basement where every movement of people is monitored and recorded. \nPrithvi Subba Gurung, deputy general secretary of the CPN-UML, is one of the leaders who strongly lobbied for a federal system while the Constituent Assembly was writing the constitution between 2008 to 2015. Eight years after the adoption of the federal democratic republican constitution, the federal system, particularly the provinces, are widely being criticised for their supposed failure to deliver. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asks former Gandaki chief minister Gurung what went wrong in the course of implementing the federal system.The implementation of the federal system has faced several hurdles since its adoption. Most provinces have for months failed even to form the governments, let alone run them efficiently. Where is the problem?We have adopted a federal system but are working against its spirit. Provinces should run autonomously. On some key issues, federal leaders and the party’s central bodies may give some direction to their provincial bodies. But most provincial activities are still centrally-governed even years after the adoption of federalism. So, our practices aren’t in line with the system. The provincial governments shouldn’t have been affected by the changes in the federal coalition. Such problems were seen in India years ago. But they have learned from their experience. In our case, leaders of major political parties treated the provincial governments as party chapters. The provincial governments are formed and run as per the constitution and all the three tiers of the governments are autonomous. The high commands in our political parties aren’t ready to accept the new constitutional setup.Are the provincial leaders equally responsible as they seek Kathmandu’s nod before taking any important decisions?They seek the centre’s support because they are trained in that way. They are too dependent on the centre. You said India learned by experience and now provinces there work more autonomously. But, in Nepal, provinces are now witnessing more problems than during their first tenure, which is evident also in the difficulties in government formation in multiple provinces. Why couldn’t they learn from the five-year experience?Nepal’s leaders and political parties are still not committed to federalism. They have failed to implement the federal system as per the spirit of the constitution. This is the major problem. The big parties as well as their leaders are guided by a centralised mindset and still prefer working in a unitary system. We should not forget that we transformed the executive and legislative bodies into three tiers of federal systems. But our judiciary retained the old structure. Therefore, the judiciary doesn’t accept the federal system and its practice in a true sense. Its verdicts reflect the same.The role of Speakers and Province Heads has courted controversies in multiple provinces. The top court invalidated some of their decisions. Is it because of lack of clarity, faults in our constitutional provisions, or is it because of the leaders?Speaker and Province Head are political posts created in accordance with constitutional provisions. When overall politics is dirty and unhealthy, those taking up these responsibilities also feel compelled to resort to similar tactics. When overall politics improves, they automatically make better decisions. Mainly there is no leader in the high command who completely owns federalism and is determined to implement it in its true spirit. This government in its policies and programmes unveiled last month had rightly said that “protecting federalism and strengthening the federal democratic republic is our top priority”. But the budget failed to introduce programmes as per the promises made in the policies and programmes.How do we correct these anomalies? Where do we begin?We are in a complex situation. Many have started to float the idea of making amendments to the constitution. But we shouldn’t forget that various forces and stakeholders had their own positions during constitution-making. They made compromises and found middle grounds to promulgate the constitution. If we go for amendments, they all will return to their respective stances. Some may want to revive the Hindu Kingdom while others will stand against it. Some leaders even within Nepali Congress have started to advocate for constitutional monarchy. But we can’t regress to the monarchical system. We can’t renounce secularism and an inclusive democratic system. We can’t backtrack on our commitment to a socialism-oriented system. We may explore some changes in our electoral system or form of governance without going against these key features of our constitution but we can’t destabilise the charter. What are the major flaws to be fixed?There are some. For instance, provinces have no role in education. The responsibility of education up to secondary level is given to the local level. And, everything is controlled by the federal government. The local units are entrusted with key responsibilities such as developing curriculum, overseeing the issues of career developments of teachers and staffers and their promotion as well as transfers etcetera. Local units can’t do all of these things efficiently as they have their own limitations. How can a local unit transfer a teacher from Kaski to Lamjung? Provinces should have been given such responsibilities. The power has been centralised at Singha Durbar. Such is also the situation in other sectors.Though the proportional representation (PR) system is hailed as one of the most beautiful features of our constitution in terms of ensuring inclusion, it has also been blamed for political instability. Many have demanded revision in the electoral system.The major political parties such as the CPN-UML and Nepali Congress have not trained their party members on the proper implementation of key constitutional features such as federalism and electoral system. The party members and general people have either wrongly understood it, or have negative impressions about the systems. These systems were adopted with an objective to resolve our decade-long conflict and address the concerns of the historically marginalised communities and even mainstream some groups through an inclusive democratic system. The idea was to integrate all the communities and maintain unity in diversity. After holding years-long debates on various options, we agreed on the mixed electoral system so as to reflect our diversity in the state agencies.As the proverb goes, “the bad workman blames his tools”, our leaders are blaming the system for their failure to secure a majority by winning people’s trust. Many countries that practise similar electoral systems have progressed. Our electoral system and the form of governance are not causing political instability. Many countries have adopted a parliamentary system and many others have practised the presidential model. Countries have progressed in both the systems. Also, there are examples of failures under both setups. So, the problem lies in our political parties and leaders, not in the systems. Shouldn’t political parties like the UML and Congress work with a plan to secure a majority by winning people’s trust? They aren’t training their focus on that but blaming the system. At times, they have squandered the majority as well and have failed to keep the party intact. Isn’t it our [leaders’] failure?Some argue that the issue of the fractured mandate can be addressed by increasing the threshold ceiling for political parties to be eligible to get PR votes and that can be done by amending election laws. Does it help?This is the idea coming from big political parties because they get more votes when fringe parties disqualify for PR votes. But a higher ceiling may deprive many small parties from representing certain communities. So, this goes against the spirit of inclusion. What we need is a good coalition culture. If we see the trend of recent decades, Indian politicians have become much more mature in this context. In the past, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi accommodated his electoral alliance partners in his ruling coalition even though his party won the majority single-handedly. If we scrap the inclusive electoral system, won’t the marginalised communities again revolt? We should be careful about that.At times, leaders have helped dissident groups split their party. These are the same leaders who issued an ordinance to change the provision that required a group within a political party to show support of 40 percent members of the party’s central committee “and” the parliamentary party. Only then could it split. They changed the threshold to 20 percent, and the “and” provision had been changed to “or”. The provision of requiring 40 percent support on both sides had earlier been included to ensure political stability. But the leaders who are helping party divisions are blaming the system for instability in the country. So, we [leaders] have to mend our ways, not blame the system. The Rastriya Swantantra Party, the fourth-largest in the lower house, has officially said that it wants to overhaul the federal system and drastically downsize the provinces. Also, leaders within the major parties who earlier stood in favour of federalism have started criticising it. On Saturday, Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa said the country can’t sustain the provinces in their present form. What is your view?I am one of those who advocated for a federal system even before the first Constituent Assembly because Nepal is a country full of discrimination based on caste, class, region and religion. We advocated for the system to do away with these discriminations and find a system to maintain unity within diversity. Federalism is the best system to promote national unity as all groups get their own space as per their unique features. For instance, if you make multiple rooms in a building, you can give space and adjust more people. But if you keep many people inside a big room, they will have difficulties—no matter how big the room is. We should strengthen the federal system. We can’t regress.Then, why do many people see provinces as a burden?In Nepal, the federal system was projected as a structure that resulted in huge liability to the state coffers. But the facts don’t substantiate it. A local unit in the federal structure replaced many erstwhile Village Development Committees (VDCs). For instance, in my home district of Lamjung, eight palikas covered the areas of 61 VDCs, and the expenditure of the current eight local units is no more than that of the erstwhile 61 VDCs. Now we don’t need 77 district coordination committees. They can be scrapped. No province needs more than seven ministers. Likewise, the federal Cabinet can be drastically downsized. Why do we need a 25-strong Cabinet at the centre when we already have seven other provincial cabinets? Twelve ministries are enough at the centre, as suggested by the high level commission on administration reform.There are many departments and divisions that were designed under the unitary system that have become completely redundant in the federal setup. So many project offices established over two decades ago based on the needs of that time are still there. These irrelevant bodies should be scrapped. This is how we can significantly cut down on administrative costs. Leaders and people don’t discuss that. They only blame provinces. \nThe weather will be generally to mostly cloudy throughout the country today.According to the Meteorological Forecasting Division, light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is likely to occur at a few places across the nation.
